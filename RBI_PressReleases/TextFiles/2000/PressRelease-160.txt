December 1, 2000 
The Reserve Bank of India has advised income tax assessees that over 800 branches of public 
sector banks in Mumbai and Navi Mumbai are authorised to accept payment of income tax dues 
as a standing arrangement. 
Income-tax assessees may take advantage of these standing arrangements made for their 
convenience. The Reserve Bank has also advised income-tax assessees in Mumbai and Navi 
Mumbai cities to deposit their income tax dues sufficiently in advance to avoid inconvenience of 
waiting in long queues at Reserve Bank counters and the last minute rush.
