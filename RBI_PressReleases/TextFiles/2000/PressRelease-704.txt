The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has decided to operationalise the automatic route for
fresh external commercial borrowings ( ECBs) up to USD 50 million and all refinancing of
existing ECBs with immediate effect. Under the automatic route arrangement, any legal
entity, registered under the Companies Act, Societies Registration Act, Co-operative
Societies Act, including proprietorship/partnership concerns, will now be eligible to enter
into loan agreements with overseas lender(s) for raising fresh ECB with an average maturity
of not less than three years for an amount upto USD 50 million and for refinancing of an
existing ECB contracted in compliance with both the ECB guidelines framed by the Ministry
of Finance and the regulations/directions/circulars issued by the Reserve Bank of India in this
regard.  Corporates would not be required to obtain prior approval for the purpose.
It may be recalled that the Government of India issued a press release on September 1,
2000, permitting fresh external commercial borrowings upto USD 50 million and refinancing
of existing ECBs under the automatic route. According to the press release, 
availing of fresh ECB upto USD 50 million and for refinancing of an existing ECB under the
automatic route would be required to submit  three copies of the loan agreement so
executed to the concerned Regional Office of the Reserve Bank through an  dealer
of their choice.  Corporates can also make necessary draw-downs under the automatic route
without prior permission from the Reserve Bank of India. The requirement of filing quarterly
returns in a prescribed format through their authorised dealers would continue. The
withholding tax exemption would continue to be granted by the Ministry of Finance
