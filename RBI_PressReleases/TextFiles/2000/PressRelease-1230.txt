RBI statement on 
June 8, 2000
The Reserve Bank of India has been watching the inter-bank transactions between 9.00
a.m. - 10.00 a.m. this morning. According to market information, there were few
transactions of small value, while the price was being moved sharply higher by some
banks.  This indicates that the inter-bank activity this morning, despite RBI's repeated
reminders seems to be speculative in nature. RBI has instructed banks to maintain square
position for the day.  If necessary, RBI will intervene directly in the market. All genuine
market participants would do well to take this into account.
