Exchange Rate Regime
There have been several enquiries in regard to the response of the
Reserve Bank of India to the public announcement made today by the People’s
Bank of China to reform its exchange rate policy.  The Reserve Bank of India has
noted this important development.
On a careful review, the Reserve Bank of India reiterates the continuation
of the current Exchange Rate Policy which has been enunciated in para 39 of the
Annual Policy Statement for the year 2005-06, which reads as follows:
“The exchange rate policy in recent years has been guided by the broad
principles of careful monitoring and management of exchange rates with
flexibility, without a fixed target or a pre-announced target or a band, coupled
with the ability to intervene if and when necessary.  The overall approach to the
management of India’s foreign exchange reserves takes into account the
changing composition of the balance of payments and endeavours to reflect
‘liquidity risks’ associated with different types of flows and other requirements”.
