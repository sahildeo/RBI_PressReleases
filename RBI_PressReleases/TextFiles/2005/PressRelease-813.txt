Sources of Accretion to Foreign Exchange Reserves in India: 2004-05
(April-March)
Background
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had, on January 31, 2003, issued a Press Note
on conclusions of a study conducted by its Department of Economic Analysis and Policy
(DEAP) on Sources of Accretion to Foreign Exchange Reserves during April-November
2002. Subsequent to this, the RBI has been regularly updating and releasing
information on ‘Sources of Accretion to Foreign Exchange Reserves’ through press
releases which are available on the RBI website (www.rbi.org.in).
Balance of payments (BoP) data for the period April-March 2004-05 are now
available. These data have been released on RBI website on June 30, 2005.

(US $ billion)
Items April-March April-March
 2004-05 2003-04
I. Current Account Balance -6.4 10.6
II. Capital Account (net) (a to f) 32.6 20.9
a. Foreign Investment 11.9 14.8
b. Banking Capital 4.0 6.2
     Of which: NRI Deposits -1.1 3.6
c. Short term credit 3.8 1.4
d. External Assistance 1.9 -2.7
e. External Commercial Borrowings 5.9 -1.5
f. Other items in capital account 5.1 2.7
III. Valuation change 2.4 5.4
Total (I+II+III) 28.6 36.9Major sources of accretion to foreign exchange reserves during 2004-05 have
been:
• Foreign investment (41.6 per cent);
• External commercial borrowings (20.6 per cent) and external assistance (6.6 per
cent);
• Short-term credit (13.3 per cent);
• Banking Capital (14.0 per cent);
• Other items under capital account which mainly reflect the difference between
customs data on imports/exports and banking channel data, rupee debt service
and other transactions, accounted for 17.8 per cent;
• These accretions to the reserves were partly counterbalanced by a current account
deficit of US $ 6.4 billion and net outflows under NRI deposits at US $ 1.1 billion.
Valuation gain, reflecting the appreciation of the GBP and the Euro against
the US dollar, accounted for an increase of US $ 2.4 billion in total reserves during
2004-05 as against a valuation gain of US $ 5.4 billion in 2003-04. While the
Reserve Bank denominates its forex reserves in terms of US dollar, these
comprise a basket of major international currencies. Accordingly, when non-US
dollar currencies appreciate vis-à-vis the US dollar, there is an addition to reserves
by way of valuation gain. The reverse is the case when these currencies
depreciate against the US dollar.
