RTGS coverage exceeds 10000 bank branches
The coverage of the Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) System exceeded
the target of ten thousand bank branches in the country. Thanks to the aggressive
strategies of the participating banks, the target was achieved six months ahead
indicating thereby the popularity of the funds transfer service.  It may be recalled that
the RTGS System was introduced in March 2004 with just four bank branches on a
pilot basis only for inter-bank transactions.  Subsequently customer transactions
were also included. Now RTGS membership includes 94 banks, Reserve Bank and
14 Primary Dealers.
The system facilitates fund transfer between identified branches of banks on a
real time basis i.e. instantaneously. Banks are required to include only those
branches which are connected through the network and capable of receiving
messages on a real time basis.  One of the requirements of the system is that the
receiving banks should return the transactions within two hours of receipt of the
transactions if the funds cannot be applied for any reason. Thus, a customer sending
funds through RTGS system at 11.00 a.m can expect the beneficiary's account to be
credited positively by 1.00 pm, if not earlier. It is seen that most of the banks apply
credit to the account holders immediately.
Coverage of ten thousand branches in the country is an important milestone in
building an efficient and stable payment system infrastructure in the country.  These
ten thousand branches are spread over 450 centres throughout the country. Though
the concentration of branches is at top 25 major centres, even smaller towns in all
the states are covered under RTGS. It has truly become a National Payment
System.
While the spread of RTGS facility is increasing each day, focus is now shifted
on increasing the traffic.  Presently, around six thousand transactions for aggregate
value of Rs.50,000/- crore are processed daily. The information relating to service
charges levied by banks for RTGS fund transfer service has been placed on RBI
website.
