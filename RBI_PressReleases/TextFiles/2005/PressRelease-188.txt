Reserve Bank Cancels the Licence of Natpur Cooperative Bank Ltd.,
Nadiad, Gujarat
In view of the fact that the Natpur Co-operative Bank Ltd., Nadiad Gujarat, had ceased to be
solvent, all efforts to revive it in close consultation with the Government of Gujarat had failed and the
depositors were being inconvenienced by continued uncertainty, the Reserve Bank of India, on
November 22, 2005, at 12.00 noon delivered the order cancelling its licence to the bank. The Registrar
of Co-operative Societies, Gujarat has also been requested to issue an order for winding up the bank
and appoint a liquidator for the bank. It may be highlighted that on liquidation every depositor is entitled
to repayment of his deposits up to a monetary ceiling of Rs.1,00,000/- from the Deposit Insurance and
Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC).
The Reserve Bank of India decided to cancel the licence of the Natpur Co-operative Bank Ltd.,
Nadiad, Gujarat as a final step after examining all the options for revival of the bank and in order to
protect the interest of the depositors. In view of the severe liquidity crunch faced by the bank, it was
placed under Directions under section 35A of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949(AACS) with effect from
16 January 2002. The inspection of the bank with reference to its position as on June 30, 2004 revealed
deterioration in its financial condition. Its deposits were getting eroded as realisable value of paid-up
capital and reserve was in the negative. In view of its precarious financial position, the Reserve Bank
issued a show cause notice to the bank on December 18, 2004 asking it to show cause as to why the
licence granted to it to conduct banking business should not be cancelled. As the bank did not have a
viable plan of action for revival and the chances of its revival were remote, the Reserve Bank of India
took the extreme measure of cancelling licence of the bank in the interest of the bank's depositors.
With the cancellation of its licence and after commencement of liquidation proceedings, the process of
paying the depositors of Natpur Co-operative Bank Ltd, the amount insured as per the DICGC Act, will
be set in motion.
Consequent to the cancellation of its licence, the Natpur Co-operative Bank Ltd., Nadiad is
prohibited from carrying on ‘banking business’ as defined in Section 5(b) of the Banking Regulation Act,
1949 (AACS) including acceptance and repayment of deposits.
