Reserve Bank Cancels the Licence of Nagrik Sahakari Bank Maryadit,
Ratlam, (Madhya Pradesh)
In view of the fact that the Nagrik Sahakari Bank Maryadit, Ratlam, (Madhya Pradesh) had
ceased to be solvent, efforts to revive it in consultation with the Government of Madhya Pradesh
had failed and the depositors of the bank were being inconvenienced by continued uncertainty, the
Reserve Bank of India, on December 7, 2005, delivered the order canceling its licence to the bank.
The Registrar of Cooperative Societies, Madhya Pradesh has also been requested to issue an
order for winding up the bank and appoint a liquidator for the bank.  It may be highlighted that on
liquidation every depositor is entitled to repayment of his deposits up to a monetary ceiling of
Rs.1,00,000/- from the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC).
The Reserve Bank of India decided to cancel the licence of the Nagrik Sahakari Bank
Maryadit, Ratlam, (Madhya Pradesh) as a final step after examining all the options for revival of the
bank and in order to protect the interest of the depositors. The bank had been classified as 'sick'
based on the findings of the inspection with reference to its financial position as on March 31,2002
and placed under rehabilitation.  The bank's financial position, however, continued to worsen and its
deposits were getting eroded as realisable value of paid-up capital and reserve was in the negative.
The Reserve Bank had, after finding the financial position of Nagrik Sahakari Bank Maryadit,
Ratlam, precarious as on June 30, 2003, issued a show cause notice dated February 19, 2004, to
the bank asking it to show cause as to why the licence granted to it to conduct banking business
should not be cancelled. The bank’s financial position continued to deteriorate and the Reserve
Bank of India placed the bank under directions with effect from March 7, 2005, restricting its
operations.  As the continuance of the bank was untenable, the Reserve Bank of India took the
extreme measure of cancelling the licence of the bank in the interest of the bank's depositors. With
the cancellation of its licence and after commencement of liquidation proceedings, the process of
paying the depositors of Nagrik Sahakari Bank Maryadit, Ratlam, the amount insured as per the
DICGC Act, will be set in motion.
Consequent to the cancellation of its licence, the Nagrik Sahakari Bank Maryadit, Ratlam, is
prohibited from carrying on ‘banking business’ as defined in Section 5(b) of the Banking Regulation
Act, 1949 (AACS) including acceptance and repayment of deposits.
