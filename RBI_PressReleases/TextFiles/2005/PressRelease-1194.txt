Revised limits of Ways and Means Advances to
State Governments
 
    Effective April 1, 2005 the revised aggregate normal Ways and Means
Advances (WMA) of the State Governments will be Rs.8,935 crore as against the
present limits of Rs.8,140 crore, representing an increase of Rs.795 crore or about
9.77 per cent. The minimum normal WMA limit is Rs.50 crore for any State. These
revised WMA limits have been computed by taking into account the average of
revenue receipts for the fiscal years 2001-2002, 2002-2003 and 2003-2004 (RE) and
then applying to this average, a multiplication factor of 3.19 per cent for the non-
special category States and 3.84 per cent for the special category States
respectively as recommended by the Advisory Committee on Ways and Means
Advances to State Governments (Ramchandran Committee).The other features of
the WMA/Overdraft (OD) Scheme 2003 will remain unchanged.
The salient features of the WMA/OD Scheme 2003 are as detailed below:
Normal WMA
The rate of interest charged on normal WMA is (a) Bank Rate (currently 6 per
cent) for the period of 1 to 90 days and (b) one per cent above the Bank Rate for the
period beyond 90 days.
Special WMA
  The Special WMA limit is linked to the investments made by State
Governments in the Government of India securities, i.e., dated securities and
Treasury Bills. A lower and uniform margin of five per cent is being applied now on
the market value of the securities for determining the operating limit of Special WMA.
The States will have to avail of Special WMA limits first before seeking
accommodation under the normal WMA limits.  The rate of interest applicable to
Special WMA is one per cent below the Bank Rate.
Minimum Balance
 The present scheme of maintaining minimum balance with the RBI continues.
There is no change in the amount of minimum balance to be maintained by the State
Governments.  
Overdraft Regulation Scheme
 (i) The maximum number of days that a State can be in overdraft is 14
consecutive working days. In case the overdraft continues in the State's account
beyond 14 consecutive working days, the RBI and its agencies shall stop payments
in respect of the concerned State Government.
(ii) The existing norm of restricting overdraft to 100 per cent of the normal WMA
limit continues. If the overdraft exceeds this limit for five consecutive working days2
for the first time in a financial year, the Reserve Bank will advise the State to bring
down the overdraft level within the 100 per cent of WMA limit. If, however, such
irregularity occurs on a second or subsequent occasion in the financial year, the
Reserve Bank will stop payments notwithstanding provision (i) above, which permits
the State overdraft upto 14 days.
(iii) No State Government will be allowed to be in overdraft for more than 36
working days in a quarter. If this is not adhered to, payments will be stopped,
irrespective of clauses (i) and (ii) above. The rate of interest on overdraft will be: (a)
overdraft up to 100 per cent of normal WMA limit - three per cent above the Bank
Rate, and (b) overdraft exceeding 100 per cent of the normal WMA limit - six per
cent above the Bank Rate.
Review of the Scheme
It may be recalled that the Ways and Means Advances /Overdraft Scheme
2003 of the State Government had come into effect from March 3, 2003 on the basis
of the recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Ways and Means Advances
to State Governments (Ramchandran Committee) in consultation with the State
Governments. The Committee had also recommended that every year the Reserve
Bank of India will revise the normal WMA limits taking into account the moving
average of revenue receipts of the latest three years.
As recommended by the Committee, the scheme will be subject to review in
th
its totality as a sequel to the Recommendations of the 12 Finance Commission.
