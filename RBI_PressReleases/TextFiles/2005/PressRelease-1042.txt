RBI places Draft Guidelines on CDR in Public Domain for Feedback
The Reserve Bank of India today placed on its website www.rbi.org.in
proposed amendments to the existing guidelines on Corporate Debt
Restructuring (CDR) for feedback from the public. Comments on the proposed
amendments may be sent within a period of one month by e-mail to
arappathurai@rbi.org.in or r-kumar@rbi.org.in
The Reserve Bank has proposed some amendments to the existing
guidelines on Corporate Debt Restructuring with a view to enhancing their
scope and making them more efficient. The amendments are based on the
recommendations made by a Special Group under the Chairmanship of
Smt. S. Gopinath, Deputy Governor, RBI.
The major modifications proposed in the existing CDR Scheme relate to
extending the scheme to corporate entities on whom banks and institutions
have an outstanding exposure of Rs.10 crore or more, support of 60 per cent of
creditors by number in addition to the support of 75 per cent of creditors by
value to make the decision making process more equitable, linking the
restoration of asset classification prevailing on the date of reference to CDR
Cell to implementation of package within three months from the date of approval
of the package and restricting the regulatory concession in asset classification
and provisioning requirement to the first restructuring.
The changes proposed to the CDR Scheme also relate to convergence
in the methodology for computation of economic sacrifice among banks and
financial institutions, regulatory treatment of non-SLR instruments acquired
while funding interest or in lieu of outstanding principal and valuation of such
instruments, limiting RBI’s role to providing broad guidelines for the CDR
System, enhancing balance sheet disclosures, pro-rata sharing of additional
finance requirement, including one time settlement (OTS) as a part of the CDR
Scheme  and discretion to the core group in dealing with wilful defaulters in
certain cases.
