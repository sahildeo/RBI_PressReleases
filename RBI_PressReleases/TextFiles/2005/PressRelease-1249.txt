DICGC raises Premium for Deposit Insurance
The Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) has
decided to raise the deposit insurance premium to 10 paise per Rs.100 from 5
paise per Rs.100 of assessable deposit per annum. The premium will be
raised  in a phased manner over a period of two years. In the first phase, the
premium rate would be increased to 8 paise from 5 paise per annum per
Rs.100 of assessable deposits for the financial year 2004-05. In the second
phase the deposit insurance premium would be increased to 10 paise per
annum  per Rs.100 of assessable deposits from 8 paise. The second phase of
increase in premium would be effective from the financial year 2005-06.  The
insured banks would, thus, have to pay the premium at the rate of 10 paise
per annum per Rs.100 of assessable deposits from the first half year April-
September 2005 onwards.
