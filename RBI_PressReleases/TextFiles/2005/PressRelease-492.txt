Reserve Bank Cancels the Licence of
Shri Vitrag Co-operative Bank Ltd., Surat, Gujarat
The Reserve Bank of India, has on September 1, 2005, cancelled the licence
granted to Shri Vitrag Co-operative Bank Ltd., Surat, Gujarat, in view of the fact that it
had ceased to be solvent. The order canceling its licence was delivered to the bank on
September 6, 2005. A requisition has been made to the Registrar of Co-operative
Societies (RCS), Gujarat for winding up of Shri Vitrag Co-operative Bank Ltd., Surat,
Gujarat and to appoint a liquidator therefore. It may be highlighted that on liquidation of
the bank every depositor is covered by the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee
Corporation (DICGC) and is entitled to repayment of his deposits up to a monetary
ceiling of Rs.1,00,000.
Earlier, the inspections of the bank conducted by the Reserve Bank of India had
revealed serious deficiencies in the working of the bank. The bank had become
insolvent with negative net worth, negative CRAR, high NPAs and significant erosion of
deposits. The bank had also violated a number of guidelines/directives of the Reserve
Bank of India.  The bank was placed under directions under section 35 A  of the Banking
Regulation Act, 1949 (As applicable to Co-operative banks) with effect from the close of
business as on October 21, 2004 imposing, inter alia, restrictions on acceptance and
repayment of deposits and sanctioning / renewal of loans. At the requisition of the
Reserve Bank, RCS superseded the Board of Directors of the bank on  November 17,
2004. A notice was issued to the bank on February 4, 2005, asking it to show cause as
to why the licence granted to it for carrying on banking business should not be
cancelled. The reply dated May 20, 2005 to the show-cause notice was not found
satisfactory. The Reserve Bank of India, therefore, took the extreme measure of
cancelling the licence of the bank in the interest of the bank’s depositors.
Following the cancellation of its licence, the bank is prohibited from carrying on
‘banking business’ as defined in Section 5(b) of the Act ibid, including acceptance and
repayment of deposits. After the liquidation proceedings are initiated by the Government
of Gujarat, the process of paying the depositors of Shri Vitrag Co-operative Bank Ltd.,
Surat, Gujarat, the amount insured as per the DICGC Act will be set in motion.2
