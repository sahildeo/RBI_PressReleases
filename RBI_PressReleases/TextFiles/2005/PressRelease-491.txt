RBI releases Handbook of Statistics on Indian Economy: 2004-05
The Reserve Bank of India has today released the seventh volume of its annual
statistical publication 'Handbook of Statistics on the Indian Economy: 2004-05'. This
publication is one of the major initiatives of the Reserve Bank aimed at improving data
dissemination by providing a useful storehouse of statistical information at one place.
Through this publication, the Reserve Bank has been providing time series data on
major economic and financial statistics for the Indian economy.
The current volume contains 241 statistical tables with the data series covering
national income aggregates, output, prices, money, banking, financial markets, public
finances, trade and balance of payments indicators. This volume also includes eight
new tables that provide time series data on Components of Net State Domestic Product
at Factor cost by Industry of origin at current as well as constant prices, Monthly and
Annual Averages of S&P CNX Nifty Index, Monthly Turnover at NSE Market
Capitalisation – NSE, India’s Overall Balance of Payments position (annual) and
Turnover in Foreign Exchange Market. Data series, where possible, have been updated
till end-June, 2005 (in some cases end-July 2005). Data for annual series are provided
since 1950-51 in this volume, though for some aggregates they continue to be available
from 1970-71. For quarterly/monthly and for higher frequency data, the time period
coverage is comparatively short.
The Handbook is brought out in three versions - print, CD-Rom and website. The
CD-Rom incorporates intelligent search facilities that allow users to search across
tables enabling the user to select one or more data series for a selected period from any
table. The web-version can be downloaded from the RBI website: http://www.rbi.org.in.
