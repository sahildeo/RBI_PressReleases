meet to discuss and sort out issues relating to capital market exposure of
regulated entities and developments in the financial markets having implications
cutting across different regulators.  Actions taken by these sub-committees are
reported to HLCCFCM for further deliberations.
Today’s meeting focused on status of issues discussed in earlier
meetings, development of a corporate bond market, regulatory issues relating  to
insurance and inter-regulatory co-ordination in financial market developments.
