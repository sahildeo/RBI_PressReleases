25 paise Coins – Valid for transactions
as hitherto: Clarifies RBI
The Reserve Bank has been receiving complaints from members of public
regarding non-acceptance of 25 paise coins by shops, business establishments,
utility services and even public sector organisations/government departments. It
is also understood that there is a general impression in commercial and trading
circles that 25 paise coins have ceased to be valid and are no longer in
circulation. The Reserve Bank wishes to clarify that such reports are without any
basis and 25 paise and 50 paise coins are easily available and continue to be
legal tender. All concerned may, therefore, without any hesitation continue to use
25 paise coins, as also 50 paise coins in settlement of transactions, as in the
past.
