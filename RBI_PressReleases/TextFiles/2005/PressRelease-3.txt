Market Stabilisation Scheme
On a review of the current macroeconomic, monetary and liquidity conditions,
including the redemptions of India Millennium Deposits (IMD), it has been decided to
suspend the issue of Treasury Bills and dated securities under the Market
Stabilisation Scheme (MSS) for the time being. However, within the overall MSS
ceiling for 2005-06, the Reserve Bank would retain the flexibility of conducting
auctions under the MSS from time to time with sufficient notice to the market, in
response to evolving circumstances.
