Reserve Bank cancels the licence of Shri Swaminarayan Co-operative
Bank Ltd. Vadodara, Gujarat
The Reserve Bank of India, has on June 2, 2005, cancelled the licence
granted to Shri Swaminarayan Co-operative Bank Ltd.Vadodara., Gujarat, in
view of the fact that it had ceased to be solvent. The order canceling the
licence was delivered to the bank on June 7, 2005. The Registrar of Co-
operative Societies, Gujarat has been requested for winding up of Shri
Swaminarayan Co-operative Bank Ltd.Vadodara, Gujarat and to appoint a
liquidator thereof. The Reserve Bank further said that every depositor of the
bank is covered by the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation
(DICGC) and on liquidation is entitled to repayment of deposits up to a
monetary ceiling of Rs.1,00,000. The liquidator is required to expeditiously
send the claims of all depositors to DICGC.
Earlier, the inspections of the bank conducted by the Reserve Bank of
India had revealed serious deficiencies in the working of the bank. The bank
had become insolvent with negative net worth, negative CRAR, high NPAs
and significant erosion of deposits. In view of the serious deficiencies in the
working of the bank, directions were issued to it under section 35A of the
Banking Regulation Act, vide order dated December 16, 2003 and the bank
was precluded from incurring fresh liabilities and was restricted from making
repayment of deposits from any deposit account above Rs.1000. The Board of
Directors of the bank resigned on December 23, 2003 and the bank was
placed under custodian by the Registrar of Co-operative Societies, Gujarat.
Despite issue of directions, the bank did not show any improvement in its
financial position. Subsequent inspection of the bank conducted with
reference to its financial position as on June 30, 2004 revealed that the
financial position of the bank continued to be precarious. A notice was,
therefore, issued to the bank on October 7, 2004, asking it to show cause as
to why the licence granted to it for carrying on banking business should not be
cancelled. The reply submitted by the bank was not satisfactory. Therefore,
the Reserve Bank of India took the extreme measure of canceling the licence
of the bank in the interest of the bank's depositors.
Following the cancellation of licence, the bank is prohibited from
carrying on banking business as defined in Section 5(b) of the Act ibid,
including acceptance and repayment of deposits. After the liquidation
proceedings are initiated by the Government of Gujarat, the process of paying
the depositors, the amount insured as per the DICGC Act will be set in motion.
The Reserve Bank has advised the depositors to approach the General
