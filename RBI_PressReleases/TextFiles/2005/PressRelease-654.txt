RBI releases Report of the Internal Group on
Rural Credit and Micro Finance
The Union Finance Minister in his statement on Union Budget – 2005-
2006 had suggested that the Reserve Bank of India should examine the ways
and means to enable banks would give more focus to provide credit to the
rural and farm households through innovative measures and promote and
empower MFIs so that they can intermediate between the lending banks and
the beneficiaries.  Accordingly, an internal group was set up by the Reserve
Bank to examine the issue of allowing banks to adopt “agency” model by
using the Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) and other external entities for
providing credit support to the rural and farm sectors, study the feasibility and
modalities of appointment of “Banking Correspondents” to function as
intermediaries between the lending banks and the beneficiaries, suggest
steps to promote Micro Finance Institutions (MFIs) and examine the extent of
regulation, if need be, of MFIs. The draft report submitted by the group was
placed on the website of the Reserve Bank on June 2, 2005 inviting
responses from public. The responses received from public were analysed by
the committee and after incorporating these suggestions, wherever
necessary, the report has been modified.
A copy of the modified report is now placed on the website of the
Reserve Bank. This report will form the document based on which the
Reserve Bank will be holding discussions with the Government of India and
other agencies concerned while firming up the policies on this subject.
The modified report of the Group is available on the Reserve Bank of
India’s website (www.rbi.org.in).
