The issuance of Treasury Bills under the MSS will be undertaken by
increasing the notified amounts for the regular auctions of 91-day, 182-dayand 364-day Treasury Bills.  Thus, the issuances under MSS covered by the
above quarterly indicative schedule will be undertaken in addition to the
regular issuances of Treasury Bills and dated securities.
The above indicative schedule is subject to variations depending on
market conditions and other relevant factors. In addition to the proposed
issuances indicated in the schedule, the Reserve Bank will also have the
flexibility for additional issuances of Treasury Bills and dated securities based
on the prevailing liquidity conditions and other relevant factors.
It may be recalled that on March 25, 2004 a Memorandum of
Understanding (MoU) between the Government of India and the Reserve
Bank of India was signed for launching of MSS. The scheme was launched
through a system of releasing quarterly indicative schedules for issuances of
Treasury Bills/dated securities under MSS. So far, under the scheme six
indicative quarterly schedules have been released on March 25, 2004, June
29, 2004, September 29, 2004, December 31, 2004, March 28, 2005 and
June 29, 2005 (as modified on August 27, 2005). This indicative schedule for
October-December 2005 quarter is in continuation to the earlier schedules.
