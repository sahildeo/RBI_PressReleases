Balance of Payments Developments in April-December 2004
Preliminary data on India’s balance of payments (BoP) for the third
quarter (Q3) of 2004-05 i.e., October-December 2004 are now available. In
conjunction with data for April-September 2004, they provide an assessment
of the BoP for the first three quarters of 2004-05 i.e., April-December 2004.
October-December 2004
• Steady expansion in trade deficit since the start of 2004-05 takes it to a
new historical peak of US $ 11.8 billion.
• Invisible receipts regain level of Q1 at US $ 18.4 billion after brief dip in
Q2, boosted by higher exports of business services.
• Surge in invisible payments since Q1 (in relation to quarterly average
level in 2003-04) continues into Q3 due to sharp rise in the imports of
business and professional services.
• Turnaround from surplus to deficit in current account balance in Q2
gets pronounced in Q3, rising from US $ 4.0 billion to US $ 5.4 billion.
• Capital account driven by dramatic surge in FII inflows after a lull in
preceding two quarters, sharp rise in external commercial borrowings
(ECBs), short-term credits and overseas borrowings by banks.
• Reserve drawdown of Q2 reversed by an accretion of US $ 6.6 billion
in Q3.

Trade balance Invisible balance Current Account balance
• Net capital flows buoyant, dominated by FII inflows, external
commercial borrowings (ECBs) and short-term trade credit.
• NRI deposits continued to record outflows; banks’ recourse to overseas
borrowings subdued despite sharp increase in Q3.
• Net FDI into India improved marginally; outward FDI surged ahead as
Indian firms exploited global synergies in manufacturing, oil exploration,
IT-related services and pharmaceuticals.
• FII flows turned positive beginning August 2004 and cumulated into a
dramatic surge in Q3, on the back of positive growth outlook, improved
corporate performance, and attractive returns.
US $ billion• Higher recourse to ECBs and short-term credit by Indian corporates
following narrowing of spreads, upgrades of sovereign rating and
strong import demand.
