Extended working hours for Reserve Bank of India
With effect from the week commencing October 10, 2005, the offices of the
Reserve Bank of India all over the country will remain open for an extended period of
45 minutes on weekdays, i.e., from Monday to Friday. Currently, the working hours in
the RBI offices on weekdays are 7 hours. These will now become 7 hours and 45
minutes.
On Saturdays, those departments which render critical support services to
banks and Government, i.e., Department of Payment and Settlement Systems
(DPSS), Public Accounts Department (PAD), Deposit Accounts Department (DAD),
etc., will continue to remain open, as hitherto. However, the other departments in the
RBI offices would remain closed on Saturdays.
This will bring the Reserve Bank of India in closer alignment with other
financial sector regulatory authorities in the country as well as the leading central
banks across the world.
