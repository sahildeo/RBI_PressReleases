Total (I+II+III) 1.5 6.6Major sources of accretion to foreign exchange reserves during April-September
2005 have been foreign investment, banking capital, external commercial borrowings
and other capital. The accretion to the foreign exchange reserves was of the order of
US $ 6.5 billion on a BoP basis (excluding valuation effects) during April-September
2005. Valuation loss, reflecting the depreciation of major currencies against the US
dollar, accounted for a decline of US $ 5.0 billion in total reserves during April-
September 2005 as against a valuation loss of US $ 0.3 billion in April-September 2004.
Taking into account the valuation loss of US $ 5.0 billion, foreign exchange reserves
recorded an increase of US $ 1.5 billion during April-September 2005 (an increase of
US $ 6.6 billion during April-September 2004).
