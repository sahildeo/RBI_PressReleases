Sources of Accretion to Foreign Exchange Reserves in India: 2004-05
(April-December)
Background
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had, on January 31, 2003, issued a Press
Note on conclusions of a study conducted by its Department of Economic Analysis
and Policy (DEAP) on Sources of Accretion to Foreign Exchange Reserves during
April-November 2002. Subsequent to this, the RBI has been regularly updating and
releasing information on ‘Sources of Accretion to Foreign Exchange Reserves’
through press releases which are available on the RBI website (www.rbi.org.in).
Balance of payments (BoP) data for the period April-December 2004-05 are
now available. These data have been released on RBI website on March 31, 2005.

Items April-December April-December
2004-05 2003-04
I. Current Account Balance -7.4 4.8
II. Capital Account (net) (a to f) 20.8 16.5

     Of which: NRI Deposits -1.3 3.7
c. Short term credit 2.7 2.4
d. External Assistance 0.7 -1.8

f. Other items in capital account 4.3 3.4
III. Valuation change 4.8 5.8
Total (I+II+III) 18.2 27.1
Major sources of accretion to foreign exchange reserves during April-
December, 2004-05 have been:
• Foreign investment (40.1 per cent);
• External commercial borrowings (22.5 per cent) and external assistance (3.8
per cent);
• Short-term credit (14.8 per cent);2
• Other items under capital account which mainly reflect the difference between
customs data on imports/exports and banking channel data, rupee debt service
and other transactions, accounted for 23.6 per cent;
• These accretions to the reserves were partly counterbalanced by a current
account deficit of US $ 7.4 billion and net outflows under NRI deposits at US $
1.3 billion.
 Valuation gain, reflecting the appreciation of the GBP and the Euro
against the US dollar, accounted for an increase of US $ 4.8 billion in the total
reserves during April-December 2004-05 as against a valuation gain of US $
5.8 billion in the corresponding period of 2003-04. While the Reserve Bank
denominates its forex reserves in terms of US dollars, these comprise a basket
of major international currencies. Accordingly, when non-US dollar currencies
appreciate vis-à-vis the US dollar, there is an addition to reserves by way of
valuation gain. The reverse is the case when these currencies depreciate
against the US dollar.
