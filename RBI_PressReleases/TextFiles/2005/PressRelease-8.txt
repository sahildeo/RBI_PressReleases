• Merchandise exports growth (20.6 per cent) in Q2, though showed a
deceleration as compared with a year ago mainly due to some seasonal
deceleration in manufactured goods exports.
• Import payments remained buoyant in Q2 (growth of 37 per cent) – oil imports
up by 56 per cent and non-oil by 30 per cent.
• Non-oil imports maintained the growth momentum (30 per cent) in tune with
the sustained pace of growth in industrial activity.
• Strong import demand led to a steady expansion in trade deficit to US $16.2
billion in Q2 (US $ 9.6 billion in Q2 of 2004-05).• Sustained growth in travel earnings and continuing pace of business and
professional services and remittances led to significant growth in invisible
receipts (62 per cent) in Q2.
• Steady expansion in invisible payments reflected continuing pace of outbound
tourist traffic from India, rising payments towards transportation, and strong
domestic demand for business related services and higher investment income
payments.
• Despite support from surplus in invisibles at about US $ 8.5 billion, the current
account deficit expanded further to US $ 7.7 billion in Q2 on account of the
large trade deficit.
• Net capital flows were higher in Q2 of 2005-06 than Q1 and also the
corresponding period of the previous year.
• The major contributors to rise in capital inflows were portfolio investments,
external commercial borrowings (ECBs), the NRI deposits and recourse to
overseas borrowings by banks.
• Accretion to foreign exchange reserves at US $ 5.3 billion in Q2 of 2005-06
was in contrast to a draw down of reserves in Q2 of 2004-05.
April-September 2005
Taking into account the partially revised data for Q1 of 2005-06 and the
preliminary data for Q2, the BoP position for the first half of 2005-06 has been
worked out. While the detailed data are set out in Table 1, the major items are
presented below.

• Merchandise export growth (21.9 per cent) during April-September 2005
witnessed some deceleration over the corresponding period of the previous
year, mainly due to some loss of momentum in export of manufacturing
goods. However, it remained substantially higher than the annual export
growth target (16 per cent growth) for the fiscal year set by the Government of
India.
• Sharp rise in merchandise import payments (48 per cent) in April-September
2005 - oil import payments rose by 43.7 per cent; non-oil import payments
higher by 50.3 per cent.• The rise in POL imports was due to elevated international crude oil prices
since volume growth in POL declined. According to the Directorate General of
Commercial Intelligence and Statistics (DGCI&S) data, the volume growth in

US $ 53.7 per barrel in April-September 2005 from US $ 36.3 per barrel April-

• Non-oil import growth (50.3 per cent) led primarily by imports of capital goods
and export related items in tandem with strong growth in domestic industrial
activity.
• According to DGCI&S data, import of gold and silver also recorded a sharp
acceleration, posting a growth of 47.2 per cent in April-September 2005 as
against 36.3 per cent a year ago.
• On a BoP basis, the trade deficit during April-September sharply widened to
US $ 31.6 billion as compared with US $ 14.8 billion in April-September 2004.

of foreign trade and rising freight rates.

• Capital flows remained buoyant dominated by foreign investment flows.
• Net FDI into India picked up on sustained growth in activity and positive
investment climate with inflows going into manufacturing, business and
computer services. Outward FDI remained on track as reflecting the appetite
of Indian companies for global expansion in terms of markets and resources.
• A turnaround in FII inflows that occurred in June 2005 continued through
September 2005, riding on the back of strong growth expectations and
corporate performance.
• Higher recourse to ECBs and short-term credit was enabled by lower spreads
on external borrowings and rising import financing requirements.
