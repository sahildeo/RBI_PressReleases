Priority Sector Lending – Investment by banks in venture capital
The concept of priority sector lending was introduced in 1969 to
underscore the necessity of financing by banks of certain neglected sectors
like agriculture. Although initially there were no specific targets fixed in respect
of priority sector lending, the banks were advised in November 1974 to raise
1
the share of their lending to this sector to the level of 33 / per cent of their
3
aggregate advances and subsequently to 40 per cent. The investments made
by the commercial banks in venture capital are reckoned under priority sector
lending with effect from April 24, 1999, provided the venture capital
funds/companies are registered with Securities and Exchange Board of India
(SEBI).
On a review of the recent developments, including overall credit growth
and growth of investment in venture capital vis-à-vis other sectors, it has been
decided that:
(i) the fresh investments that may be made by banks on or after July 1,
2005 in venture capital shall not be eligible for classification under
priority sector lending; and that
(ii) the investments, which have already been made/to be made by
banks up to June 30, 2005, in venture capital shall not be eligible for
classification under priority sector lending with effect from April 1,
2006.
