RBI constitutes a new  Financial Markets Department
In the context of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act, the Annual
Policy Statement for the year 2005-06 had indicated reorientation of government
debt management operations while simultaneously strengthening monetary
operations within the Reserve Bank with a view to moving towards functional
separation between debt management and monetary operations.
Accordingly, the Reserve Bank has today constituted a new Financial Markets
Department (FMD).  The functions of FMD would include: (i) monetary operations
such as open market operations (OMO), liquidity adjustment facility (LAF), standing
liquidity facilities and market stabilisation scheme (MSS), (ii) regulation and
development of money market instruments such as call/notice/term money, market
repo, collateralised borrowing and lending obligation (CBLO), commercial paper
(CP) and certificates of deposit (CDs) and (iii) monitoring of money, Government
securities and forex markets.  In due course, the functions of the Department would
also cover RBI's operations in the domestic foreign exchange market to achieve the
desired integration in RBI's conduct of monetary operations.
