September 6, 2005 (i) 91-Day Treasury Bill Rs. 1,500 crore
(ii) 182-Day Treasury Bill Rs. 1,000 crore
September 14, 2005 (i) 91-Day Treasury Bill Rs. 1,500 crore
(ii) 364-Day Treasury Bill Rs. 1,000 crore
September 21, 2005 (i) 91-Day Treasury Bill Rs. 1,500 crore
(ii) 182-Day Treasury Bill Rs. 1,000 crore
September 28, 2005 (i) 91-Day Treasury Bill Rs.1,500 crore
(ii) 364-Day Treasury Bill Rs. 1,000 crore
(a) Total Auction Amount Rs. 32,500 crore
(b) Redemption of Treasury Bills issued under MSS Rs. 26,251 crore
(c) Redemption of dated security issued under MSS Rs. 20,000 crore
(d) Net Issuance (a-b-c) (-) Rs.13,751 crore2
The issuance of Treasury Bills under the MSS will be undertaken by
increasing the notified amounts for the regular auctions of 91-day, 182-day
and 364-day Treasury Bills.  Thus, the issuances under MSS covered by the
above quarterly indicative schedule will be undertaken in addition to the
regular issuances of Treasury Bills and dated securities.
The issuance of 91-day and 364-day Treasury Bills in this quarter will
essentially be the roll over of these Treasury Bills issued earlier. However, on
account of shortfall in the absorption in 364-day Treasury Bills auction
conducted under MSS on August 18, 2004, the net proposed issuance of 364-
day Treasury Bills will be around Rs. 249 crore (face value). In the case of
182-day Treasury Bills, the net proposed issuance will be Rs. 6,000 crore as
there will not be any rollover. Taking into account the redemption of 6.18 per
cent Government Stock 2005 issued under MSS for Rs. 20,000 crore on
September 3, 2005, there will be net release of liquidity amounting to Rs.
13,751 crore.
The above indicative schedule is subject to variations depending on
market conditions and other relevant factors. In addition to the proposed
issuances indicated in the schedule, the Reserve Bank will also have the
flexibility for additional issuances of Treasury Bills and dated securities based
on the prevailing liquidity conditions and other relevant factors.
It may be recalled that on March 25, 2004 a Memorandum of
Understanding (MoU) between the Government of India and the Reserve
Bank of India was signed for launching of MSS. The scheme was launched
through a system of releasing quarterly indicative schedules for issuances of
Treasury Bills/dated securities under MSS. So far, under the scheme five
indicative quarterly schedules have been released on March 25, 2004, June
29, 2004, September 29, 2004, December 31, 2004 and March 28, 2005. This
indicative schedule for July-September 2005 quarter is in continuation to the
earlier schedules.
