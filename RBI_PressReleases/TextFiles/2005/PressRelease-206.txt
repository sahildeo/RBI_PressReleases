Reserve Bank Rejects the Licence of
The Kotagiri  Co-operative  Urban Bank Ltd., Kotagiri , Tamil Nadu
The Reserve Bank of India has on November 17, 2005 rejected the licence
application of the Kotagiri Co-operative Urban Bank Ltd., Kotagiri, in view of the fact
that it had ceased to be solvent.  All efforts to revive it had failed and the depositors
were being inconvenienced by continued uncertainty. The Registrar of Co-operative
Societies, Chennai has also been requested to issue an order for winding up the
bank and appoint a liquidator for the bank.  It may be highlighted that on liquidation
every depositor is entitled to repayment of his deposits up to a monetary ceiling of
Rs.1,00,000/- from the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation
(DICGC).
The Reserve Bank of India decided to reject the licence application of the
Kotagiri Co-operative Urban Bank Ltd, Kotagiri, Tamil Nadu as a final step after
examining all the options for revival of the bank and in order to protect the interest of
the depositors.  The bank was classified as weak on February 7,1996.The financial
position of the bank deteriorated considerably from 2001-2002 onwards and the bank
was advised by the Reserve Bank of India to go out of the purview of the Banking
Regulation Act 1949 (AACS) on October 26, 2002.  However, no progress was made
in this direction by the bank. The statutory inspection with reference to its position as
on March 31, 2004 revealed further deterioration in its financial condition and its
deposits were getting eroded as realisable value of paid-up capital and reserve was in
the negative. In view of the bank’s precarious financial position and considering that it
was not in a position to repay its deposits, a show cause notice under Section 22 of
the Act, ibid, was issued to the bank on November 4, 2004 calling upon it to show
cause as to why its application for banking licence dated October 31,1976 should not
be rejected and the bank taken into liquidation.  In the reply submitted by the bank to
the show cause notice, the bank had projected to reduce the net NPAs and enhance
its share capital by March 31,2005. A scrutiny of the bank’s books of accounts carried
out by the Reserve Bank of India with reference to its position as on March 31,2005
revealed that the bank had failed to achieve the targets projected by it for the year
ended March 31,2005 and its financial position was precarious. With a view to
protecting the interests of the present and future depositors, the Reserve Bank of
India issued directions on September 21,2005 to the bank under Section 35A of the
Act, ibid, restricting its operations.  As the bank did not have a viable plan of action for
revival and the chances of its revival were remote, the Reserve Bank of India took the
extreme measure of rejecting the licence application of the bank in the interest of the
bank's depositors. With the rejection of its application for licence and with the
commencement of liquidation proceedings, the process of paying the depositors of
the Kotagiri Co-operative Urban Bank Ltd., Kotagiri, the amount insured as per the
DICGC Act would be set in motion.Consequent to the rejection of its licence application, the Kotagiri Co-
operative Urban Bank Ltd., Kotagiri, is prohibited from carrying on ‘banking business’
as defined in Section 5(b) of the Act, ibid, including acceptance and repayment of
deposits.
