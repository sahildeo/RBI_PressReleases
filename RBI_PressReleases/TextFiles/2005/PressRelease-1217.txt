Depositors of The Raghuvanshi Cooperative Bank Ltd., Mumbai,
Maharashtra to get up to Rs.1 lakh
In view of the fact that the The Raghuvanshi Cooperative Bank Ltd., Mumbai,
Maharashtra had ceased to be solvent, the Reserve Bank of India, on March 18, 2005
delivered to the bank the order of cancelling its licence. A requisition has been made to
the Commissioner for Co-operation and Registrar of Cooperative Societies, Maharashtra
for winding up of the Raghuvanshi Cooperative Bank Ltd., Mumbai, Maharashtra and to
appoint a liquidator therefor. It may be highlighted that all the depositors of The
Raghuvanshi Cooperative Bank are eligible to get their claims up to Rs.1 lakh from the
Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC). The liquidator is required
to expeditiously send the claims of all depositors to DICGC. Every effort will be made to
complete the formalities within about 90 days to settle the depositors' claims.
Earlier, the bank was placed under directions with effect from the close of business
as on August 29, 2002, in view of serious liquidity crunch faced by the bank. The
Inspection of the bank by the Reserve Bank of India with reference to its financial position
as on December 31, 2002 revealed its precarious financial position. The bank requested
for some time for revival. The next statutory inspection by the Reserve Bank of India with
reference to its financial position as on June 30, 2004 revealed further deterioration in the
bank's financial position and brought out several deficiencies and irregularities in its
functioning. A show cause notice was issued to the bank on September 28, 2004 advising
it to show cause as to why the licence granted to it for carrying on banking business
should not be cancelled. The bank's reply to the notice was examined and was found not
satisfactory. In view of this and the various serious violations of RBI guidelines and
negative net worth, negative CRAR, high NPAs and significant erosion of deposits
revealed during the inspection, the Reserve Bank of India took the extreme measure of
cancelling the licence of the bank in the interest of the bank's depositors. With the
cancellation of its licence and taking it into liquidation, the process of paying the
depositors of The Raghuvanshi Cooperative Bank Ltd., Mumbai, Maharashtra, the
amount insured as per the DICGC Act will be set in motion.
