Macroeconomic and Monetary Developments
First Quarter Review 2005-06
The Annual Policy Statement for the year 2005-06 had indicated that there
will be a First Quarter Review and a Third Quarter Review of Part I of the Statement
in addition to the Mid-term Review. Accordingly, the document “Macroeconomic and
Monetary Developments: First Quarter Review 2005-06” is being issued today to
serve as a backdrop to the First Quarter Review of the Annual Policy Statement.
The highlights of macroeconomic and monetary developments in the first
quarter or Q (April-June), 2005-06 are:
1 
I.  The Real Economy
• The cumulative rainfall recorded during June 1 to July 13, 2005 was one per cent
above normal as against 10 cent below normal a year ago.
• Industrial production was buoyant and broad-based in April-May, 2005 with
growth accelerating in the manufacturing sector.
• Lead indicators point to robust services sector performance in Q1, 2005-06.
• The generally positive developments in agriculture, industry and services
coupled with upbeat business confidence have imparted optimism regarding
growth prospects for 2005-06.
II. Fiscal Situation
• In April-May, 2005-06 the Centre's revenue deficit and the primary deficit were
placed lower than their levels a year ago as proportion to budget estimates.
• During the first quarter of 2005-06 (April-June), gross and net market borrowings
raised by the Centre amounted to 29.7 per cent and 30.9 per cent of the budget
estimates.
• States raised an amount of Rs.10,245 crore (Rs.7,554 crore through tap sale
and Rs.2,691 crore though auctions).
• The weekly average utilisation of WMA and overdraft by the States was
significantly lower than a year ago.
III. Monetary and Liquidity Conditions
• Up to July 8, 2005 money supply expansion at 13.9 per cent remained well within
the indicative trajectory (14.5 per cent growth) set in the Annual Policy
Statement.
• Reserve money increased by 18.1 per cent up to July 15, 2005 as banks
unwound LAF positions and withdrew liquidity to finance the higher demand for
credit.2
IV. Price Situation
• Inflation remained firm worldwide in Q of 2005-06, driven up by high and volatile
1 
international crude oil prices.
• Producer prices continue to lead consumer prices in most economies, reflective
of the supply-side character of inflation.
• International oil prices reached new highs, crossing US $ 62 per barrel on July 7,
2005.
• In India, supply-side pressures on inflation conditions in April 2005 eased in May
and June pulled down by the base effect of higher prices last year as well as
various monetary and fiscal measures to stabilise inflation expectations.
• Despite increases in electricity and petrol and diesel prices during June 2005,
year-on-year wholesale price inflation edged down to 4.1 per cent as on July 9,
2005, from 5.1 per cent at end-March 2005.
V. Financial Markets
• Comfortable liquidity kept money market segments tethered to the reverse repo
rate during the greater part of the quarter.
• The foreign exchange market remained orderly and forward premia declined
sharply in tandem with the movement of the rupee in the spot segment.
• Yields in the Government securities market eased after April, 2005 with ebbing of
inflationary pressures.
• In the credit market, key interest rates edged up as commercial credit offtake
was strong and broad-based.
• The equity market staged a strong rally which pushed the BSE Sensex to new
highs beyond the 7300 level in July 2005.
VI. The External Economy
• In 2004-05, India's balance of payments recorded a modest current account
deficit after a gap of three years.  Buoyant merchandise exports and invisible
earnings were outstripped by a massive expansion of imports, powered by
soaring international crude prices as well as strong domestic demand.
• Merchandise export growth at 19.5 per cent remained robust during April-June
2005.
• Non-oil imports recorded a sharp increase of 40.2 per cent indicative of rising
investment demand in the economy.
• High and volatile international crude oil prices have translated into a large
expansion in the POL import bill.
• The trade deficit almost doubled from US $ 6.0 billion during April-June 2004 to
US $ 11.5 billion during April-June 2005.
• Foreign direct investment (FDI) flows picked up alongside various types of debt
flows, while institutional portfolio flows significantly moderated in April-May 2005
as in other emerging markets.
• India’s foreign exchange reserves at US $ 137.6 billion on July 15, 2005 were
sufficient to finance 14 months of imports.
