Restrictive practices while accepting banknotes
Reserve Bank of India has been receiving complaints from the public
regarding adoption of restrictive practices such as forcing the customers to note
down their names on the banknotes, listing the note numbers on the bills submitted
for payment insisting on undertaking while depositing higher denomination
banknotes, etc., by certain public and private sector organizations/institutions thus
causing avoidable harassment to the public.
Reserve Bank, therefore, considers it necessary to emphasise that all
Government/Semi Government Offices, Public/Private Sector institutions and also
any other organization/office/individual accepting cash should desist from the
aforesaid restrictive practices.
For further information and guidance, the Regional Offices of the Bank may
please be approached. The features of genuine Indian Currency Notes are also
posted on RBI website: www.rbi.org.in
