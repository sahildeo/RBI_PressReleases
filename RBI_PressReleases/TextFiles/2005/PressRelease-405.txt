RBI places Draft Technical Paper on Review of Priority Sector Lending
in public domain for comments
The scope and extent of priority sector has undergone several changes since the
introduction of the concept. While there has been continuous demand to include new
areas within the ambit of priority sector, there have also been suggestions that the focus
on the needy sectors of economy and weaker sections of the society is getting diluted
because of such inclusions.
A need has, therefore, been felt to review the concept and the segments of
priority sector. Accordingly, an Internal Working Group under the Chairmanship of Shri
C.S.Murthy, Chief General Manager-in-Charge, Reserve Bank of India, Rural Planning
and Credit Department, Central Office was set-up for the purpose of examining the
issues. The Group examined the need for continuance of priority sector lending
prescriptions, reviewed the existing policy on priority sector lending including the
segments constituting the priority sector, targets and sub-targets, etc., examined the
suggestions received regarding eligibility criteria of various items under priority sector
and related aspects. The Working Group has prepared a Draft Technical Paper on
Review of Priority Sector Lending. The Reserve Bank of India has placed the Draft
Technical Paper on its website (www.rbi.org.in). Views/ comments on the Technical
Paper may be sent to cgmincrpcd@rbi.org.in or faxed to 022- 22658276 or 2265 8273.
