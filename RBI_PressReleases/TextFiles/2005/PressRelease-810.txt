Balance of Payments Developments in 2004-05
Preliminary data on India’s balance of payments (BoP) for the fourth
quarter (Q4) of 2004-05 i.e., January-March, 2005 are now available. In
conjunction with data for April-December 2004, they provide an assessment
of the BoP for the full financial year i.e., April-March, 2004-05.
January-March 2005
• Seasonal upsurge in both exports and imports; moderation in growth of
import payments in relation to previous quarters restrained trade deficit
to October-December 2004 (Q3) level.
• Invisible receipts at intra-year peak, driven by remittances, business
and professional services.
• Steady expansion in invisible payments reflecting rising domestic
demand for business related services.
• Net invisible surplus halted the rising current account deficits in
previous two quarters and enabled   a small current account surplus in
Q4.
• Net capital flows steady at Q3 level; major contributors being FIIs,
external commercial borrowings (ECBs), aid flows and banking capital.
• Accretion to foreign exchange reserves at US $ 12.6 billion was the
highest in relation to earlier quarters of 2004-05.

• Net capital flows remained buoyant due to surge in both debt and non-
debt inflows.
• NRI deposit outflows more than offset by banks’ overseas borrowings
and use of nostro (overseas) balances.
• Net FDI into India up on favourable investment climate; outward FDI
surged as liberalised investment regime spurred search for new
markets, takeovers and natural resources.
• Positive FII flows since August 2004 cumulated into surge in Q3 and
Q4, on the back of positive growth outlook, improved corporate
performance and attractive valuations.
• Higher recourse to ECBs and short-term credit enabled by narrowing of
spreads on emerging markets and upgrades of sovereign ratings.
