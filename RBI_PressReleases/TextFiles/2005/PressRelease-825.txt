RBI places Draft Guidelines on Credit Cards in Public Domain
The Reserve Bank of India today placed the draft guidelines on
credit cards on its website (www.rbi.org.in). The guidelines, when finally
issued, will be applicable to all commercial banks/Non Banking Finance
Companies (NBFCs) in regard to their credit card operations and will
come into effect as soon as implemented. Views/ suggestions may
please be sent within a period of one month to
pvijayabhaskar@rbi.org.in or can be faxed to 022-22150663.
It may be recalled that the Reserve Bank of India had constituted
a Working Group to evolve a Regulatory Mechanism for Cards to
ensure orderly growth of this segment of consumer credit and protect
the interest of the banks/ NBFCs and their customers. The report of the
Group was placed in public domain on April 23, 2005. The draft
guidelines issued today have been framed taking into account the
feedback received from the media, members of the public and others on
the report of the Working Group.
