No Dearth of Coins: RBI
The Reserve Bank of India has today stated that there is no dearth of
coins of any denomination and the members of public should assert their right
to get the appropriate change and should not accept other goods in return for
the balance amount due to them. It has also reiterated that coins of all
denominations are legal tender.
The Reserve Bank of India has come across reports and has also
received complaints that traders and shopkeepers are reluctant to return the
small change on grounds of non-availability of coins, particularly, 25 and 50
paise denominations. The Reserve Bank of India has informed that there is
absolutely no shortage of coins of any denomination with all the offices of the
Reserve Bank of India and also banks. In fact, the Reserve Bank in many of
its offices is facing the problem of reverse flow of coins, i.e., members of
public are returning the coins.
