Reserve Bank cancels the licence of The Royale Co-operative
Bank Ltd., Surat, Gujarat
The Reserve Bank of India, has on June 2, 2005, cancelled the licence
granted to the Royale Co-operative Bank Ltd., Surat, Gujarat, in view of the
fact that it had ceased to be solvent. The order canceling the licence was
delivered to the bank on June 7, 2005. The Registrar of Co-operative
Societies, Gujarat has been requested for winding up of The Royale Co-
operative Bank Ltd., Surat, Gujarat and to appoint a liquidator thereof. The
Reserve Bank further said that every depositor of the bank is covered by the
Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) and on
liquidation is entitled to repayment of deposits up to a monetary ceiling of
Rs.1,00,000. The liquidator is required to expeditiously send the claims of all
depositors to DICGC.
Earlier, the inspections of the bank conducted by the Reserve Bank of
India had revealed serious deficiencies in the working of the bank. The bank
had become insolvent with negative net worth, negative CRAR, high NPAs
and significant erosion of deposits. Thereafter, due to bank's inability to meet
its clearing liability, it was suspended from the membership of Surat Bankers'
Clearing House w.e.f. October 6, 2004. In view of the serious deficiencies in
the working of the bank, directions were issued to it under section 35A of the
Banking Regulation Act, vide order dated October 12, 2004 and the bank was
precluded from incurring fresh liabilities and was restricted from making
repayment of deposits from any deposit account above Rs.500. The Registrar
of Co-operative Societies, Gujarat was required to supercede the Board of
Directors of the bank vide Requisition dated November 4, 2004 as per the
provisions of Section 115A of the Gujarat Co-operative Societies Act, 1961.
Despite issue of directions, the bank did not show any improvements in its
financial position. Subsequent inspection of the bank conducted with
reference to its financial position as on September 30, 2004 revealed that the
financial position of the bank continued to be precarious. A notice was,
therefore, issued to the bank on December 8, 2004, asking it to show cause
as to why the licence granted to it for carrying on banking business should not
be cancelled. The bank has not submitted a reply to the same. Therefore, the
Reserve Bank of India took the extreme measure of canceling the licence of
the bank in the interest of the bank's depositors.
Following the cancellation of licence, the bank is prohibited from
carrying on banking business as defined in Section 5(b) of the Act ibid,
including acceptance and repayment of deposits. After the liquidation
proceedings are initiated by the Government of Gujarat, the process of paying
the depositors, the amount insured as per the DICGC Act will be set in motion.2
