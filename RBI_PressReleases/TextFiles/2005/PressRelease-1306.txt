Liberalised policy for overseas presence of Indian banks
and foreign banks' presence in India
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) today announced that applications
from Indian banks for setting up representative offices/branches/
subsidiary(ies) outside India as well as applications received from foreign
banks for their branch presence in India would be considered based on a
liberalised policy and a simplified procedure for expeditious disposal.
While examining the applications made by Indian banks, the RBI would
consider, inter-alia, the supervisory comfort, the banks' sustainable financial
and competitive strength and robustness of their systems for Know Your
Customer (KYC)/Anti Money Laundering (AML). Likewise, applications from
Indian banks for acquisition of banks outside India would be examined by the
RBI keeping, additionally in view, other factors, such as, overseas regulatory
approval, due diligence on investee bank and degree of management control.
Currently, permission for opening of branches by foreign banks in India
is guided by the commitment of 12 branches in a year to the World Trade
Organisation (WTO). In practice, however, a higher number has also been
permitted on merits. It is now proposed to adopt a more liberalised policy in
this regard for branches to be set up in unbanked areas.
Applications from Indian and foreign banks would henceforth be
processed on a continuous basis and in a time bound manner, as per a
simplified procedure.
