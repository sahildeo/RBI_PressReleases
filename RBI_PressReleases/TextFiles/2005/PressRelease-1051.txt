Dialogue with Cooperative Banks: RBI Clarification
It is reported in a section of the press that the Reserve Bank of India
(RBI) has communicated to around 100 loss making cooperative banks across

face liquidation and that banks in Gr.III category have been given six months
time to improve performance and graduate to the next level.
It is clarified that the Reserve Bank has not issued any such
communication to any bank. It may be mentioned here that the Reserve Bank
is taking various measures to address the problem of weak entities in the
urban cooperative banking sector and as a part of this effort, had placed a
draft Vision Document for Urban Cooperative Banks in public domain. The
Vision Document is in the process of being finalised based on responses
received from various quarters. It is expected that the ongoing dialogue will
strengthen the sector.
