MACROECONOMIC AND MONETARY DEVELOPMENTS
IN 2004-05
In the past, the “Macroeconomic and Monetary Developments” was issued
simultaneous to the release of the Annual Policy Statement, as a separate
accompanying document. However, this document is being issued this year a day
ahead of the Annual Policy Statement being released tomorrow, since it could serve
as a backdrop to the context and rationale of the monetary policy formulation.
The highlights of macroeconomic and monetary developments in 2004-05
are:
I.  Growth Saving and Investment
• With real GDP growth at 6.9 per cent in 2004-05, India’s macroeconomic
performance turned out to be stronger than anticipated.
• Despite unfavourable monsoons, real GDP originating in agricultural and
allied activities rose by 1.1 per cent with foodgrains production at over 210
million tonnes.
• Industrial recovery firmed up and broadened, driven mainly by manufacturing
and buoyant exports.
• The services sector remained the main engine of growth.
• The rate of gross domestic saving is estimated at 28.1 per cent of GDP in
2003-04 and the rate of gross domestic capital formation at 26.3 per cent.
II. Fiscal Situation
• The introduction of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management
(FRBM) Rules 2004 marked a new beginning in the fiscal consolidation
process.
• While the required reduction in the revenue deficit and the fiscal deficit of the
Centre in the FRBM Rules was achieved, the budgeted targets for      2004-
05 were missed.
• Gross tax revenue was 3.7 per cent lower than the budget estimates mainly
on account of lower corporation tax collections and union excise duties;
aggregate expenditure net of debt swap transactions was lower than the
budgeted level by one per cent.
• Major deficit indicators for States are budgeted to decline in 2004-05 with an
ongoing endeavour of the State Governments to carry forward fiscal reforms.
• The Union Budget, 2005-06 has set a 'pause' in the path set by the FRBM
due to implementation of the Twelfth Finance Commission's (TWFC)
recommendations and the need to compensate the States for any revenue
loss due to implementation of VAT.
• Centre’s fiscal deficit is budgeted to decline to 4.3 per cent from 4.5 per cent
in the preceding year during 2005-06 while net market borrowings are2
budgeted to be higher at Rs.1,03,791 crore as against Rs.45,943 crore in the
revised estimates for 2004-05.
III. Monetary and Liquidity Conditions
• Monetary conditions continued to be driven by large capital inflows in 2004-
05 as in the previous year.
• Money supply (M3) at 12.8 per cent remained well within the trajectory of
14.0 per cent projected by the Annual Policy Statement for 2004-05.
• The growth in banks deposits was a shade lower than projected due to
substitution in favour of postal deposits.
• Foreign currency assets of the Reserve Bank increased by Rs. 1,15,044
crore in 2004-05 on top of an accretion of Rs. 1,41,428 crore in 2003-04.
• A sharp rise in non-food credit set in from July 2004.
• With the overhang of liquidity in the beginning of the year, combined with
large capital inflows, the Reserve Bank had to continually absorb liquidity
during the year barring some episodic pressures.
• Sterilisation operations were conducted through institution of a new
mechanism called Market Stabilisation Scheme (MSS).
IV. Price Situation
• Inflation conditions firmed up worldwide in 2004.
• Central banks began signaling a reversal of their accommodative monetary
policy stance to stabilise inflation expectations.
• Commodity prices, especially crude oil, metals and coal, picked up as global
demand outpaced supply alongside strengthening economic activity.
• Supply side pressures dominated the domestic inflation scenario.
• Headline inflation, measured by year-on-year changes in the wholesale price
index (WPI) moved in two distinct phases during 2004-05
- April-August 2004 marked by hardening of domestic prices of coal,
petroleum products and metals due to imported inflation and
unfavourable South-West monsoon;
- September 2004 – March 2005 when inflationary pressures began to
recede reflecting the waning of the impact of monsoon, fiscal
measures to cushion the pass-through of international prices and
monetary policy measures to drain excess liquidity and  rein in inflation
expectations.
V. Financial Markets
• Domestic financial markets remained broadly stable during 2004-05.
• Money market segments exhibited easy liquidity conditions barring
episodic pressures.
• The foreign exchange market remained generally orderly with moderate
upward pressure on the exchange rate.
• Yields in the government securities market firmed up due to resurgence of
inflationary pressures and the hardening of international interest rates.
• Stock market reflected the growing confidence in the strong fundamentals
of the Indian economy with investor optimism straining against intermittent
corrections.
• The BSE Sensex outperformed many major international stock market
indices.3
• Investor interest in the public issues segment strengthened during 2004-
05, encouraged by the upbeat sentiment in the secondary market.
VI. The External Economy
• India’s merchandise exports grew by 27.1 per cent during the first eleven
months of 2004-05 – much higher than the target of 16 per cent set for 2004-
05 by the Government of India.
• India’s imports grew strongly by 36.4 per cent (April-February); surge in oil
imports by 44.6 per cent and non-oil imports by 33.3 per cent took the trade
deficit to an all time high.
• Invisible receipts increased by 37.5 per cent during April-December 2004
year on year, led by software, remittances and earnings from tourism.
• Invisible payments recorded a sharp rise of 62.3 per cent in April-December
2004 on account of travel, transportation, insurance and business services.
• The current account balance swung from a continuous run of surpluses
between 2001-02 and 2003-04 into a modest deficit during 2004-05.
• Net capital inflows at US$20.7 billion during April-December 2004 were
higher by 25 per cent as compared with US$ 16.6 billion recorded in the
corresponding period of the previous year.
• India’s foreign exchange reserves rose by US $ 28.6 billion to US $141.5
billion as on March 31, 2005, the fifth largest in the world.
