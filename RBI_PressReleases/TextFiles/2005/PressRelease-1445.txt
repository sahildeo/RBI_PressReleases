Depositors of The Aurangabad Peoples' Cooperative Bank Ltd., Aurangabad,
Maharashtra to get up to Rs.1 lakh
In view of the fact that the The Aurangabad Peoples' Cooperative Bank Ltd.,
Aurangabad, Maharashtra had ceased to be solvent, the Reserve Bank of India, on
January 13, 2005 delivered to the bank the order of cancelling its licence. A
requisition has been made to the Commissioner for Co-operation and Registrar of
Cooperative Societies, Maharashtra for winding up of the Aurangabad Peoples'
Cooperative Bank Ltd., Aurangabad, Maharashtra and to appoint a liquidator
therefor. It may be highlighted that all the depositors of The Aurangabad Peoples'
Cooperative Bank are eligible to get their claims up to Rs.1 lakh from the Deposit
Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC). The liquidator is required to
expeditiously send the claims of all depositors to DICGC. Every effort will be made to
complete the formalities within about 90 days to settle the depositors' claims.
Earlier, as an inspection of the bank by the Reserve Bank of India with
reference to its financial position as on December 31, 2002 revealed its precarious
financial position, the bank was issued instructions to improve its financial position.
The next statutory inspection by the Reserve Bank of India with reference to its
financial position as on December 31, 2003 revealed further deterioration in the
bank's financial position and brought out several deficiencies and irregularities in its
functioning. The bank was placed under directions with effect from the close of
business as on October 5, 2004, and a show cause notice was issued to the bank on
October 26, 2004advising it to show cause as to why the licence granted to it for
carrying on banking business should not be cancelled. The bank's reply to the notice
was examined and was found not satisfactory. In view of this and the various serious
violations of RBI guidelines and negative net worth, negative CRAR, high NPAs and
significant erosion of deposits revealed during the inspection, the Reserve Bank of
India took the extreme measure of cancelling the licence of the bank in the interest of
the bank's depositors. With the cancellation of its licence and taking it into liquidation,
the process of paying the depositors of The Aurangabad Peoples' Cooperative Bank
Ltd., Aurangabad, Maharashtra, the amount insured as per the DICGC Act will be set
in motion.
