RBI's Vision on Financial Sector Technology sees
Percolation of Technology Benefits to Customers
The Reserve Bank of India, today placed on its website (www.rbi.org.in)
the draft of ‘Financial Sector Technology Vision’ document. The document
elucidates technology vision for the financial sector. It may be recalled that the
Governor had, in the Annual Policy Statement 2005-06, mentioned that the
Financial Sector Vision Document will be put in public domain for wider
dissemination. Comments and suggestions on the vision document may be
emailed to fstfeedback@rbi.org.in. The full document can be accessed on the
RBI website (www.rbi.org.in)  for a period of one month from today. The broad
areas of coverage in the draft vision of Financial Technology Vision include:
v IT for regulation and supervision
v IT and IDRBT
v IT for financial sector
v IT for Government related functions
With ‘IT for efficiency and excellence' being the vision, the corporate
objective in the document reads as,  “Enabling banks to leverage on IT for
better customer service, improved housekeeping and overall systemic
efficiency”
Recognising the requirements of IT for the financial sector, therefore, the
draft vision document on Financial Sector Technology elucidates the thrust
areas of the Reserve Bank, by providing generic information on various
standards and approaches, providing for IS audit and requisite focus on
business continuity plans. The vision document proposes that specific attention
would be devoted towards percolation of technology efforts to all types of banks
and all sections of the customers in the banks with specific reference to the
rural areas and the use of affordable technology products that can be easily
used by the target clientele, with inter-shareable resources.
The document also envisions use of technology for regulation and
supervision. It outlines emerging challenges in the form of implementation of
standardisation across a variety of hybrid systems at different financial entities,
the  need for decision support systems and technology to facilitate risk based
offsite supervision. The path envisages common inter-operable web-based
structures for transmission of data relating to regulatory functions and the use of
a single centralised data base for all information, apart from hiving off the
operation of non-critical functions by the Reserve Bank.
Outlining the vision for the Institute for Development and Research in
Banking Technology (IDRBT) the document envisages the Institute to be a
premier research institute, concentrating on research and development for the2
banking and financial sector, providing educational/training facilities and hiving
off business related activities. The vision for the use of IT in Government
transactions focuses on specific attention on the need for business process re-
engineering, changes in rules and procedures for alignment with e-governance
in a manner to achieve implementable objectives.
The draft vision document also gives a broad overview of the thrust
areas of the direction provided by the Reserve Bank in respect of IT for the past
more than two decades and sets out a roadmap for the financial sector for
2005-08, it traces some of the major landmarks, such as, introduction of
mechanised cheque processing using MICR technology, computerisation of
bank branches, computerisation of Government business, commissioning of the
Indian Financial Network (INFINET) for the use of the banking sector, under the
aegis of a state-of-the-art Institute for Development and Research in Banking
Technology (IDRBT), initiation of ‘Straight Through Processing (STP)’ facilities
using standardised message formats for inter-institution communication in an
electronic mode, providing guidelines for IS audit, internet banking and the
establishment of a data warehouse.
