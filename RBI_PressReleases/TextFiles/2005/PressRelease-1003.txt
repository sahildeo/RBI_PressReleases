RBI releases the draft Report of the Internal Working Group on RRBs
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) today released the draft Report of the
Internal Working Group on Regional Rural Banks (RRBs), which was constituted
to examine various alternatives available within the existing legal framework for
strengthening the RRBs and making them viable rural financing institutions.
The Group studied the recommendations made by various committees
constituted in the past on the subject and made a comprehensive state-wise/
sponsor bank-wise review of the performance of the RRBs. The Group examined
the Regional Rural Banks Act, 1976 for exploring the possibilities for restructuring
of RRBs through merger/ consolidation, change of sponsor banks and offering
sponsorship of RRBs to private sector banks. The Group has made
recommendations relating to minimum capital requirements of the RRBs and
suggested measures for better governance, suitable regulation and supervision
of the RRBs.
The draft report of the Group is available on the Reserve Bank of India’s
website (www.rbi.org.in). Views may please be sent to cgmincrpcd@rbi.org.in or
