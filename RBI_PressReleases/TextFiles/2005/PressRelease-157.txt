RBI invites Feedback on
“Licensing Policy for Authorised Persons: Liberalisation” Report
With the progressive liberalisation in foreign exchange related
transactions common person can now undertake a variety of current account
transactions without approaching the Reserve Bank of India. A large segment
of population is increasingly getting connected with forex transactions of an
expanding nature on individual accounts.
Taking into account the day-to-day needs of (a) common persons for
undertaking various transactions, (b) tourists for better encashment services
and (c) requests received from existing Full-fledged Money Changer (FFMCs)
there is a felt need for widening and rationalising the intermediate tier of
authorised persons which is licensed to undertake foreign exchange
transactions to meet the day-to-day needs. These would cater to tourists for
encashment and common persons for release of foreign exchange for medical
treatment, education, employment, travel related transactions and in general a
large variety of current account transactions that are not trade transactions.
With a view to liberalising and  rationalising the scope of activities currently
undertaken by the authorised persons, therefore, an internal group was
constituted to study  the related issues and make recommendations keeping
in view the need for enhanced as well as wider access and accompanying
safeguards, especially reporting requirements.
The Reserve Bank of India has today placed for feedback the Report of
the Internal Group on “Licencing Policy for Authorised Persons: Liberalisation”
on its website www.rbi.org.in. The feedback on the recommendations of
the Report are invited and may be directly sent to the Chief General
Manager, Foreign Exchange Department, Reserve Bank of India,
Central Office Building, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Mumbai - 400001 or by
email to cgmincfed@rbi.org.in or by faxed to 022-22665330 before
December 15, 2005.
