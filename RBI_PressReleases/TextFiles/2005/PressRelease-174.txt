RBI to introduce Second LAF from November 28
At present, the Reserve Bank of India operates Liquidity Adjustment Facility
(LAF) to inject/absorb liquidity through daily repos/reverse repos auctions. These
operations are conducted in the forenoon between 9.30 a.m. and 10.30 a.m. To
fine-tune the management of liquidity and in response to suggestions from the
market participants, it has been decided to introduce a Second Liquidity
Adjustment Facility (SLAF), with effect from November 28, 2005. SLAF will be
conducted on all working days except Saturdays and bids for the SLAF will be
received between 3.00 p.m. and 3.45 p.m.
The salient features of SLAF are the same as those of LAF. However, the
settlement for the LAF and SLAF will be conducted separately and on gross basis.
SLAF will be subject to review and modifications as needed, based on
experience.
