Non-acceptance of Small Coins is an offence: clarifies RBI
The Reserve Bank of India has come across reports that banks are
reluctant to accept 50 paise and 25 paise coins. A recent study conducted by
the Reserve Bank through the Birla Institute of Technology (BITS), Pilani also
suggests that similar reluctance is exhibited by shopkeepers and traders.
The Reserve Bank of India states categorically that all small
denomination coins including those of 50 paise and 25 paise coins are legal
tender and non-acceptance of any such coins is an offence. The Reserve
Bank has advised all banks to desist from any such restrictive practice.
Members of public should assert their right to get appropriate change and
acceptance of all denomination coins by banks in exchange.
