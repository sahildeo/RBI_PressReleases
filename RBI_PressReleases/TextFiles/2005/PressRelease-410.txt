• Merchandise exports growth at around 22 per cent remained strong in
Q1 of 2005-06, although the rate of export growth moderated reflecting
the high base in the previous year (34 per cent).
• Import payments, reflecting the buoyant economic activity, increased
sharply by 63.2 per cent  - oil imports up by 31 per cent; non-oil import
payments higher by 77.9 per cent.
• Non-oil imports growth accelerated year-on-year, led by rising demand
for industrial inputs - mirroring the step-up in the pace of industrial
activity.
• With crude oil prices (Indian basket) averaging US $ 49.2 per barrel in
April-June 2005 (US $ 34.1 per barrel in April-June 2004), oil imports
grew sharply in Q1 of 2005-06. The rise in POL imports also reflected
an increase in volume terms (up by 13.4 per cent in April-June 2005).India's POL Imports and International Crude Prices

Export Import Trade balance
• Invisibles gross receipts remained buoyant (45.5 per cent growth),
reflecting the underlying dynamism in travel earnings, sustained pace of
export of software and other business and professional services and
stable remittances from overseas Indians.
• Software exports remained on the high growth trajectory during April-
June 2005.
• Private transfers, comprising remittances from Indians working abroad,
contributed about 23 per cent of gross invisible receipts.

engineering, technical and distribution services.

Current Account balance
• Net capital flows at US $ 7.1 billion were driven mainly by inflows under
foreign direct investment, external commercial borrowings (ECBs),
banking capital and FIIs.
• FDI inflows increased substantially, mainly into industries such as
cement, sugar, plastic, synthetic and rubber industries, and hotels with
Mauritius and the US remaining dominant investor countries.
• FII inflows recorded a turnaround in June with a net inflow of US $ 1.2
billion during the month. Inflows through ADRs/GDRs also remained
buoyant.
• Banks in India drew down foreign currency assets held abroad while
NRI deposits recorded net positive inflows of small magnitude.
• Turnaround in short-term trade credit to net outflows occurred as oil
companies increased their recourse to domestic financing, and
repayments accelerated.
