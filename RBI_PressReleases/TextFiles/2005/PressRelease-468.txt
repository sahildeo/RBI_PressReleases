Reserve Bank cancels the licence of
The Metro Cooperative Bank Ltd., Surat, Gujarat
The Reserve Bank of India, vide its order of September 8, 2005 cancelled the
licence granted to the Metro Cooperative Bank Ltd., Surat Gujarat, in view of the fact
that it had ceased to be solvent. The order cancelling its licence was delivered to the
bank on September 16, 2005 at 11.00 a. m. A requisition has been made to the
Registrar of Cooperative Societies (RCS), Gujarat for winding up of The Metro
Cooperative Bank Ltd., Surat, Gujarat and to appoint a liquidator therefor. It may be
highlighted that on liquidation of the bank every depositor is covered by the Deposit
Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) and is entitled to repayment
of his deposits up to a monetary ceiling of Rs. 1,00,000/-.
In October 2004, the bank failed to meet its clearing liability and ceased to be
a member of the Surat Bankers’ Clearing House.  In view of the bank's poor liquidity
position and on the request of the bank, the Reserve Bank of India issued Directions
under Section 35A of the Act prohibiting the bank from accepting fresh deposits, and
restricting repayment of deposits up to Rs. 500/- per depositor with effect from the
close of business of October 21, 2004.
Earlier, an inspection of the bank by the Reserve Bank of India with reference
to its financial position as on September 30, 2004 revealed the serious concerns
relating to the precarious financial position and management aspects of the bank. Its
financial parameters were found to be severely impaired. On account of high NPAs,
it's Net worth and Capital to Risk Weighted Assets Ratio had turned negative and a
significant portion of its deposits had been eroded. The bank had also violated a
number of the Reserve Bank's guidelines/directives. The functioning of the Board of
Directors was far from satisfactory. There was a complaint against the bank-alleging
opening of fictitious accounts and fraudulent transactions in certain accounts of the
bank. A scrutiny of the bank's books of accounts was conducted by the Reserve
Bank of India in December 2004, which revealed a number of irregularities
committed by the management. In the light of the findings of the scrutiny and the
irregularities in the functioning of the bank, the Reserve Bank requisitioned the RCS
to supersede the Board of the bank and accordingly the RCS superseded the Board
of Directors on February 19, 2005 and an Administrator was appointed.
A notice was issued to the bank on March 11, 2005, asking it to show cause
as to why the licence granted to it for carrying on banking business should not be
cancelled. The bank’s reply to the notice was examined but was found not
satisfactory. The Reserve Bank of India, therefore, took the extreme measure of
cancelling the licence of the bank in the interest of the bank’s depositors. With the
cancellation of its licence, the Metro Cooperative Bank Ltd., Surat is prohibited fromcarrying on ‘banking business’ as defined in Section 5(b) of the Act ibid, including
acceptance and repayment of deposits. After the liquidation proceedings are initiated
by the Government of Gujarat, the process of paying the depositors of The Metro
Co-operative Bank Ltd., Surat, Gujarat, the amount insured as per the DICGC Act
will be set in motion.
