Interest Rate Ceiling on NRE Deposits Revised
Interest Rate on NRE Term Deposit Accounts
On a review, it has been decided that, until further notice, the interest rates on
fresh repatriable Non-Resident (External) Rupee (NRE) deposits for one to three
years contracted effective close of business in India on November 17, 2005 should
not exceed 75 basis points (as against 50 basis points effective since November 1,
2004) above the London Inter Bank Offered Rate(LIBOR)/Swap rates for US dollar of
corresponding maturity.
The maturity period of repatriable NRE deposits would continue to be one to
three years and the interest rate as determined above for three year deposits would
also be applicable in case the maturity period exceeds three years.
The changes in interest rates will also apply to repatriable NRE deposits
renewed after their present maturity period.
It may be recalled that with a view to aligning interest rates on repatriable
Non-Resident (External) Rupee (NRE) deposits with international interest rates,
ceiling on NRE deposit rates linked to the US dollar LIBOR/Swap rates of
corresponding maturity was introduced effective July 17, 2003.  The ceiling interest
rates on NRE deposits have since been revised from time to time.
Interest Rate on NRE Savings Deposits
The interest rate on NRE savings deposits will be at rate applicable to
domestic savings deposits (as against the ceiling of LIBOR/Swap rates for six month
maturity on US dollar deposits) effective close of business in India on November 17,
2005.
