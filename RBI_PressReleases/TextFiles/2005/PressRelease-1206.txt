(ii) 182-Day Treasury Bill Rs. 1,000 crore
Total Auction Amount Rs. 32,500 crore
Of which rollover Rs. 24,730 crore
Net Issuance Rs. 7,770 crore
1The issuance of Treasury Bills under the MSS will be undertaken by increasing
the notified amounts for the regular auctions of 91-day, 182-day and 364-day Treasury
Bills.  Thus, the issuances under MSS covered by the above quarterly indicative
schedule will be undertaken in addition to the regular issuances of Treasury Bills and
dated securities.
The issuance of 91-day in this quarter will essentially be the roll over of 91-day
Treasury Bills issued in the January-March 2005 quarter. The rollover of 364-day
Treasury Bills issued would also start from April 15, 2005. However, on account of
shortfall in the absorption in 364-day Treasury Bills auction conducted under MSS on
June 23, 2004, the net proposed issuance of 364-day Treasury Bills will be around Rs.
770 (face value) crore. Further, the absorption through newly introduced in the 182-day
Treasury Bills is proposed to be Rs. 7,000 crore (face value).
 The above indicative schedule is subject to variations depending on market
conditions and other relevant factors. In addition to the proposed issuances indicated in
the schedule, the Reserve Bank will also have the flexibility for additional issuances of
Treasury Bills and dated securities depending upon the prevailing liquidity conditions
and other relevant factors.
It may be recalled that on March 25, 2004 a Memorandum of Understanding
(MoU) between the Government of India and the Reserve Bank of India was signed for
launching of MSS. The scheme was launched through a system of releasing quarterly
indicative schedules for issuances of Treasury Bills/dated securities under MSS. So far,
under the scheme four indicative quarterly schedules have been released on March 25,
2004, June 29, 2004, September 29, 2004 and December 31, 2004. This indicative
schedule for April-June 2005 quarter is in continuation to the earlier schedules.
