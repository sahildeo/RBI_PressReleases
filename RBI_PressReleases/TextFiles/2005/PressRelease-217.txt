Foreign shareholdings in Private Sector
Banks under PIS
The Reserve Bank of India has notified on November 17, 2005 that it
would be in order for Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs)/Non-Resident
Indians (NRIs) and Persons of Indian Origin (PIOs) to purchase the shares of
Centurion Bank of Punjab Ltd. through stock exchanges in India under
Portfolio Investment Scheme (PIS). The Reserve Bank has stated that
consequent on the amalgamation of Bank of Punjab with Centurion Bank with
effect from October 1, 2005, the paid up capital of the erstwhile Centurion
Bank now known as Centurion Bank of Punjab Ltd., has increased and
therefore aggregate foreign share holdings have gone below the ban limit.
