Revised Indicative Schedule for Auctions of Treasury Bills
under the Market Stabilisation Scheme (MSS)
A reference is invited to the Press Release No. 2004-2005/1385 dated June 29,
2005 announcing the Quarterly Indicative Schedule for Issuance of Bills/Bonds under
Market Stabilisation Scheme (MSS) for the period July 1, 2005 to September 30, 2005.
Taking into account all relevant factors, Reserve Bank in consultation with the
Government has decided to increase the notified amount for the auctions of 91-Day
Treasury Bills under MSS from Rs. 1,500 crore to Rs. 3,500 crore for the five auctions
scheduled on August 31, 2005, September 6, 2005, September 14, 2005, September
21, 2005 and September 28, 2005. The notified amounts for auctions of 182-Day and
364-Day Treasury Bills under MSS would remain unchanged at Rs. 1,000 crore each
during the above period. Consequently, notified schedule of auctions of Treasury Bills
under MSS from August 31, 2005 will be as follows:
Auction Date Nature of Instrument Auction Amount
(Indicative)
August 31, 2005 (i) 91-Day Treasury Bill Rs. 3,500 crore
(ii) 364-Day Treasury Bill Rs. 1,000 crore
September 6, 2005 (i) 91-Day Treasury Bill Rs. 3,500 crore
(ii) 182-Day Treasury Bill Rs. 1,000 crore
September 14, 2005 (i) 91-Day Treasury Bill Rs. 3,500 crore
(ii) 364-Day Treasury Bill Rs. 1,000 crore
September 21, 2005 (i) 91-Day Treasury Bill Rs. 3,500 crore
(ii) 182-Day Treasury Bill Rs. 1,000 crore
September 28, 2005 (i) 91-Day Treasury Bill Rs.3,500 crore
(ii) 364-Day Treasury Bill Rs. 1,000 crore
The issuance of Treasury Bills under the MSS will be undertaken by increasing
the notified amounts for the regular auctions of 91-day, 182-day and 364-day Treasury
Bills.  Thus, the issuances under MSS covered by the above quarterly indicative
schedule will be undertaken in addition to the regular issuances of Treasury Bills and
dated securities.The above indicative schedule is subject to variations depending on market
conditions and other relevant factors. In addition to the proposed issuances indicated in
the schedule, the Reserve Bank will also have the flexibility for additional issuances of
Treasury Bills and dated securities based on the prevailing liquidity conditions and other
relevant factors.
It may be recalled that on March 25, 2004 a Memorandum of Understanding
(MoU) between the Government of India and the Reserve Bank of India was signed for
launching of MSS. The scheme was launched through a system of releasing quarterly
indicative schedules for issuances of Treasury Bills/dated securities under MSS. So far,
under the scheme six indicative quarterly schedules have been released on March 25,
2004, June 29, 2004, September 29, 2004, December 31, 2004, March 28, 2005 and
June 29, 2005.
