Special SLBC Meeting
to  discuss Flood Relief Measures in Tamil Nadu
In the context of the recent unprecedented rains in the State of Tamil
Nadu leading to widespread floods and consequent destruction of life and
property, a Special meeting of the State Level Bankers Committee (SLBC)
was convened on December 1, 2005. The meeting, which was attended by
officials of the State Government, Reserve Bank of India, banks and financial
institutions, noted that the floods had wrought havoc in 22 of the 29 districts
and several villages had been marooned.  It was decided to invoke, with
immediate effect, the Reserve Bank of India’s standing instructions to banks
for providing relief in the event of natural calamities.
The relief measures involve conversion of existing loans and grant of
fresh loans for new crops, including working capital.  It was decided that the
special District Consultative Committees would be convened in the affected
districts to look into specific packages for measures that would be required for
each of the affected districts.
As the recent rains over the last week in Chennai have led to
dislocation in normal life, another special meeting of the SLBC was held today
to ensure that the banks are geared to provide necessary financial relief to the
affected persons.  The meeting noted that all bank branches, ATMs and
currency chests functioned normally.  While banks assured that they would
provide consumption loans to the affected persons as also assistance for
repairs and reconstruction of dwelling units, reconstruction of small
enterprises, the SLBC decided to constitute a Special Task Force comprising
senior officials of the State Government, Reserve Bank of India, banks,
National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development, National Housing Bank,
Small Industries and Development Bank of India and Life Insurance
Corporation as well as United India Insurance.  The Task Force will assess
the extent of damage and specifically recommend special relief measures
which may be needed.
