RBI to function normally on September 30, 2003
September 29, 2003
The Reserve Bank of India has stated that its offices in Mumbai and Navi Mumbai
will conduct normal business on Tuesday, September 30, 2003. Commercial banks and co-
operative banks will, however, remain closed for public on that day on account of half-yearly
closing of their accounts. There will, therefore, be no clearing on that day at the
Brihanmumbai Bankers' Clearing House. The settlement of MICR cheques presented on
September 29 will be done on Wednesday, October 1, 2003.
