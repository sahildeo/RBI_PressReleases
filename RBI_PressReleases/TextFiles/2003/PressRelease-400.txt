Exchange Facility for Public in Fort area
September 26, 2003
With a view to enlarging the exchange facility to the public, the Reserve Bank of India
has made special arrangement for distribution of packets of Rs.5 notes and coins and exchange of
soiled/mutilated notes. The facility will be offered on Friday, September 26, 2003 between 11.00
a.m. and 2.30 p.m. at State Bank of India, Main Branch, Fort, Mumbai.
In order to make available clean currency notes to public in adequate quantity, the
Reserve Bank has taken several steps in the recent past. These include making arrangements with
the postal authorities in Mumbai for distribution of coins through the post offices in Maharashtra
and Goa and opening one currency chest branch on one Sunday in a month at selected centres to
exclusively provide currency exchange and distribution of small coins and suck out the bad
notes.
