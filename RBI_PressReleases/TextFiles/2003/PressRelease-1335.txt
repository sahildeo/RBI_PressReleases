March 7, 2003
With a view to enlarging the exchange facility to the public, the Reserve Bank of India has
made special arrangement for distribution of packets of Rs.5 notes and coins in Mazgaon.
The facility will be offered on Wednesday, March 12, 2003 between 11.00 a.m. and 2.30 p.m.

In order to make available clean currency notes to public in adequate quantity, the Reserve
Bank has taken several steps in the recent past. These include making arrangements with the
postal authorities in Mumbai for distribution of coins through the post offices in Maharashtra
and Goa and opening one currency chest branch on one Sunday in a month at selected centers
to exclusively provide currency exchange and distribution of small coins and suck out the bad
notes.
