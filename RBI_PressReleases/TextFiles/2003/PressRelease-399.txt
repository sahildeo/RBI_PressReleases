RBI Caution against Misrepresentation of its Registration
September 24, 2003
It has come to the notice of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) that a financial company
attempted to mislead the public through a misrepresentation of the power of attorney
registered with the RBI as the RBI’s registration for conducting business.
The RBI has clarified that its Public Debt Office (PDO) routinely registers
documents, such as, resolutions and specimen signatures, certificates of change in name,
power of attorney, etc., in its books to any holder of government securities.  It provides a
registration number to be quoted by the holder while transferring securities, or related
correspondences with the Reserve Bank.  Such registration does not amount to authorising
the holder to conduct any business whatsoever.
Members of the public are, therefore, advised to be cautious of such attempts at
misrepresentation and to bring such instances to the notice of RBI.
