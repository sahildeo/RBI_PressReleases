Developments relating to Balance of Payments during July-September 2003 
The actual Balance of Payments (BoP) statistics have been compiled for the second quarter of 
the current fiscal year (i.e. July-September 2003). The BoP data for the first quarter of 2003-04 
(i.e. April-June 2003) have also been revised in view of the latest information available on 
invisibles, foreign investment and external commercial borrowings.  
July-September 2003 
The salient features of the developments in BoP during July-September 2003 are set out below: 
Current Account 
o During July-September 2003, on payments basis, merchandise exports 
amounted to US $ 14.6 billion as against US $ 13.4 billion in the corresponding 
period of the previous year, thus registering a growth of 8.9 per cent. Imports 
during the same period stood at US $ 20.8 billion as compared with US $ 16.0 
billion during July-September 2002. At this level, imports showed a growth of 
29.7 per cent.  
o The trade deficit on payments basis increased to US $ 6.2 billion in the quarter 
under review as compared with US $ 2.7 billion during July-September 2002, 
mainly on account of higher imports.  
o Private transfers (net), comprising mainly remittances and local withdrawal from 
NRI deposits, were higher at US $ 4.8 billion than US $ 3.6 billion in July-
September 2002.  
o Net position of the invisibles account registered a surplus of US $ 6.7 billion as 
against a surplus of US $ 4.3 billion during July-September 2002.  
o The current account during July-September 2003, with a trade deficit of US $ 6.2 
billion and a net invisible surplus of US $ 6.7 billion, registered a surplus of US $ 
0.5 billion.  
Capital Account 
o Net inflows under foreign investment comprising foreign direct investment (FDI) 
and portfolio investment amounted to US $ 3.1 billion during July-September 
2003 as against US $ 0.5 billion during the corresponding period of the previous 
year. This was mainly on account of higher inflows under portfolio investment.  
o FDI inflows (net) at US $ 0.9 billion were higher than that of US $ 0.6 billion in 
July-September 2002.  
o Inflows under portfolio investment to India amounted to US $ 2.1 billion in July-
September 2003 in view of the expectation of good performance of the Indian 
economy as compared with a net outflow of US $ 0.1 billion during July-
September 2002.  
o Net inflows under external loans (comprising external assistance, external 
commercial borrowings and short-term loans) stood at US $ 0.9 billion as against 
an outflow of similar magnitude during the corresponding period of the previous 
year.  
o Net inflows under banking capital comprising foreign assets and liabilities 
(including NRI deposits) of commercial banks and balances of foreign central 
banks and international institutions stood at US $ 1.2 billion as compared with US 
$ 1.8 billion in July-September 2002.  
o The net position of the foreign assets and liabilities of the commercial banks 
excluding NRI deposits, showed a net inflow of US $ 1.2 billion compared with an 
inflow of US $ 1.3 billion in the corresponding period of the previous year.  o Other capital (net) comprising difference between the banking channel and 
customs data relating to exports, fund held abroad raised through External 
Commercial Borrowing (ECB), India’s subscription to international institutions and 
quota payments to IMF amounted to US $ 2.4 billion as against US $ 1.1 billion in 
the same period of 2002-03.  
Overall Balance 
o Overall balance comprising current account surplus (US $ 0.5 billion), capital 
account surplus (US $ 7.5 billion) and errors and omissions (US $ 0.3 billion) 
showed a higher net inflow of US $ 8.4 billion than an inflow of US $ 4.9 billion in 
July-September 2002.  
o The net accretion to foreign exchange reserves excluding valuation change 
amounted to US $ 8.4 billion as compared with US $ 4.9 billion during July-
September 2002. Including valuation change (US $ 0.3 billion) net accretion to 
foreign exchange reserves stood at US $ 8.7 billion.  
  
April-September 2003 
The data for the first half of the fiscal year 2003-04, including the compiled data for the quarter 
July-September 2003 and the revised data for April-June 2003 reveals the following features. 
• A small surplus (US $ 207 million) was posted in the current account in the first half of the 
year, driven mainly by the surplus in the invisible account (US $ 12.3 billion), more than 
offsetting higher trade deficit (US $ 12.1 billion) in relation to the first half of last year.  
• Net capital inflows (US $ 12.9 billion) were more than 3 times than in April-September 
2002, mainly on account of foreign investment (US $ 5.2 billion), banking capital (US $ 
3.1 billion) including non-resident deposits (US $ 2.0 billion) and short -term credit (US $ 
2.2 billion).  
• The main debt creating flows – external assistance and commercial borrowings - 
recorded lower net outflows.  
• Net current and capital transactions taken together explain 97 per cent of the change in 
reserves excluding valuation effects (US $ 13.5 billion) leaving a small amount of US $ 
407 million as errors and omissions, which is less than one per cent of current receipts.
