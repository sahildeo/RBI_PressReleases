RBI invites Comments on  Draft Guidelines on Bank Investments in Non-SLR Debt
Securities
October 27, 2003
The Reserve Bank of India has requested banks to furnish their feedback/comments
on the draft guidelines on investment in non-SLR debt securities by banks, in particular
through private placement, to enable it to finalise the proposed guidelines.
It may be recalled that in order to contain the risk arising out of investment in non-
SLR debt securities by banks, in particular through private placement, the Reserve Bank of
India had earlier issued draft guidelines on banks’ investment in non-SLR securities for
comments.
The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has since advised the guidelines
required to be complied with by listed companies making issue of debt securities on a private
placement basis and listed on a stock exchange. (SEBI circular
SEBI/MRD/SE/AT/36/2003/30/9 dated September 30, 2003) In consonance with the SEBI
guidelines, the Reserve Bank has further reviewed its guidelines to be followed by banks in
this regard and the revised draft guidelines have been placed on the Reserve Bank’s website
(www.rbi.org.in). The guidelines on investments on non-SLR debt securities require banks to
make all fresh non-SLR investments only in listed debt securities except for a proportion up
to 20 per cent of their non-SLR portfolio in unlisted but rated securities.
The Reserve Bank of India has requested banks to furnish their feedback/comments
on the draft guidelines to the Chief General Manager-in-Charge, Department of Banking
Operations and Development, Reserve Bank of India, Central Office, World Trade Centre,
Cuffe Parade, Mumbai 400 005, (email:mailto:rbidboco@bom3.vsnl.net.in) within a week
from the date of this Press Release to enable the Reserve Bank to finalise the proposed
guidelines.
