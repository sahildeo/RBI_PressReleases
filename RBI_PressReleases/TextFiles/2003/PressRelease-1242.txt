RBI and tax collecting bank branches
to extend banking hours on March 29 and 31
March 28, 2003
The Reserve Bank of India has decided to keep its tax collection counters open for
extended time on March 29, 2003 and March 31, 2003 beyond normal business hours to
facilitate payment of taxes by tax assessees.  The Reserve Bank has also asked all public
sector banks and other banks authorised to collect taxes, to keep their tax collecting
branches open for a reasonably longer time for this purpose only.
In a circular issued on March 27, 2003, the Reserve Bank has asked its own
Offices and the agency banks to provide all facilities to assessees for depositing taxes,
including keeping their tax collecting counters open for longer business hours on March
29 and March 31, 2003. The Reserve Bank has asked its own offices and also agency
banks to extend the banking hours suitably at different centres across the country
depending on the Governments' requirements and the rush of the assessees for payment
of taxes.
Accordingly, the counters at the Reserve Bank of India, in Mumbai and Navi
Mumbai will remain open upto 3.30 pm for receiving cash deposits representing
Government taxes and upto 6.30 pm for receiving cheques/instruments representing
Government taxes on both the days.
The Reserve Bank of India has requested the taxpayers to take advantage of this
facility for payment of the taxes.
