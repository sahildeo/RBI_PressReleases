First Tranche of Tap Issue Shortly
February 19, 2003
Various states will raise a total of Rs.14,151 crore during the current financial year. The
first tranche of Rs.7,325 crore will be raised shortly through a tap issue.  The balance amount
will be raised in March 2003, the Reserve Bank of India has stated today.
The total amount of Rs. 14,151 crore includes normal additional market borrowings by
some states totalling Rs.3,657 crore, fresh borrowings of Rs.10,000 crore by some states under
the Debt Swap Scheme and the balance amount of Rs.494  crore from the allocations already
approved by the central government for the current financial year for some states.
Six states, namely, Assam, Orissa, Rajasthan, Sikkim, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal will
raise normal additional market borrowing totaling Rs.3,657 crore; all states except Maharashtra,
Sikkim and West Bengal will raise fresh borrowings of Rs.10,000 crore under the Debt Swap
Scheme mutually agreed between the Central Government and the states for credit to the Central
Government's account towards repayment of existing high cost debts owed by the States to the
Centre; and Andhra Pradesh and Chhattisgarh will raise Rs.494 crore which is the balance
amount out of the allocations already approved by the central government  for these states for the
current financial year.
Thus the tap issue to be held shortly for Rs.7,325 crore will include 50 per cent of the
normal additional market borrowing for six states, 50 per cent of the amount of allocations
approved under the Debt Swap Scheme and the balance amount of Rs.494 crore for Andhra
Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. The balance amount of Rs.6,826 crore will be raised in March 2003.
Notifications in this regard will be issued separately.
