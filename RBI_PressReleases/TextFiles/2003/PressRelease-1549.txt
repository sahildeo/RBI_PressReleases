RBI revises Rate Fixation Method for Back-Stop Facility
January 20,2003
In the light of experience gained, the methodology for fixation of the rates for Back-stop
Facility has been reviewed. It has now been decided that the back-stop rates will be fixed in
future as detailed below :
(i)  The rate will be 1.0 percentage point over reverse repo cut-off rate at which funds were
injected earlier during the day in the regular Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) auctions.
(ii)  Where no reverse repo bid is accepted as part of LAF auction, the rate will be 2.0 to 3.0
percentage points over the repo cut-off rate of the day emerged in LAF as may be decided by
the Reserve Bank of India. The exact mark-up will depend on the assessment of the liquidity
conditions by the Reserve Bank.
(iii)  On the days when no bids for repo or reverse repo auctions are received/accepted, the
back-stop rate will be decided by the Reserve Bank keeping in view all relevant aspects
including NSE-MIBOR, previous back-stop rates and assessment of liquidity conditions in
the market.
As a cushion over the normal liquidity facility at Bank Rate, the Reserve Bank of
India also provides back-stop facility to banks and primary dealers. The back-stop facility is
extended to banks and primary dealers at variable rate of interest. The methodology for fixing
the variable daily rates for back-stop facility was earlier announced on June 4, 2001.
