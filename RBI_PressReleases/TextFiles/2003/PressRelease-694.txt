NBFCs may offer Nomination on their Deposits
July 28, 2003
The Reserve Bank of India has, in consultation with the Government of India, decided
that Non-banking Finance Companies (NBFCs) may, for the purpose of nominations, adopt
the Banking Companies (Nomination) Rules, 1985 made under Section 45ZA of the Banking
Regulation Act, 1949.
Accordingly, non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) are permitted to accept
nominations made by the depositors in form DA1, cancellation of nomination in form DA2
and variation in nomination in form DA3.  These forms are similar to the ones specified
under the Banking Companies (Nomination) Rules, 1985 made under Section 45ZA of the
Banking Regulation Act, 1949 for the purpose of nomination.
In terms of the provisions of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 the depositor/s of
non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) may nominate, in the manner prescribed under the
rules made by the Central Government under Section 45ZA of the Banking Regulation Act,
1949, one person to whom, the NBFC can return the deposit in the event of the death of the
depositor/s.
The detailed circular and a copy of the Rules are available on RBI web site
