Interest Rates on NRI Deposits
October 30, 2003
In supersession of the instructions issued on September 17, 19 and October 28, 2003,
the Reserve Bank of India today clarified that while NBFCs can accept repatriable deposits
from  Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) contracted in India, they are not allowed to open Non-
Resident (External) Rupee (NRE) deposit accounts.
Other instructions on acceptance of deposits from NRIs relating to rate of interest and
minimum and maximum period remain unchanged. It may be noted that at present the rate of
interest payable on NRI deposits accepted on repatriable basis should not exceed 25 basis
points above the LIBOR/SWAP rates for US dollar of the corresponding maturity as in case
of scheduled commercial banks.
