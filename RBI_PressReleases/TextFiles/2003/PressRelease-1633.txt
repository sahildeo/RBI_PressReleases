January 3, 2003
It has been decided to continue the enhanced notified amount for auctions of
91-day Treasury Bills at Rs.1000 crore in the next four auctions of these bills starting
from January 8, 2003 to January 29, 2003. These four auctions would also be
conducted by using multiple price auction format. The position will be reviewed
thereafter.
The Reserve Bank had, on December 6, 2002, announced enhancement in the
notified amount for the auctions of 91-day Treasury Bills. The amount was raised
from Rs.250 crore to Rs.1000 crore for four auctions conducted during the period
from December 11, 2002 to January 1, 2003.  While announcing the enhancement in
the amount, the Reserve Bank had said that it would review the position after the four
auctions.
The experience has been reviewed and it has been decided to keep the auction
amount for these bills at Rs. 1000 crore.
The notified amount and the present format of auction of 364 day Treasury
Bills will remain unchanged.
