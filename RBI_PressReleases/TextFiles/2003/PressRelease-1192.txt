Prepayment of External Debt by Corporates from 2000-01 to 2002-03
(upto December)
April 8, 2003
Background
In order to permit corporate bodies to take advantage of low international interest rates,
the Reserve Bank of India, in September 2002, further liberalised the automatic route for
prepayment of external commercial borrowings (ECBs) by the corporates. The Reserve Bank
permitted any borrower who had raised ECBs in accordance with the prevalent rules/regulations
to prepay the outstanding ECBs up to an amount of US $ 100 million without prior permission
from the Reserve Bank.  The ceiling of US $ 100 million for prepayment of ECBs out of local
resources/market purchases has been removed since March 1, 2003.   Authorised Dealers are,
therefore, permitted to allow remittances towards prepayment of outstanding ECBs without any
limit.
Prepayment by Corporate Sector exceed US $ 1 billion
A study conducted by the Department of Statistical Analysis and Computer Services
(DESACS) of the Reserve Bank of India indicates that corporates have prepaid their ECBs
amounting to US $ 595 million during the period April-December 2002. The amount was US $
241 million and US $ 270 million during full financial year 2001-02 and 2000-01, respectively.
The total prepayment of ECBs from 2000-01 to 2002-03 (up to December 2002) amounted to US
$ 1,106 million. The reduction of interest burden on account of the prepayment worked out to
about US $ 90 million.  Thus, by prepayment, the borrowers saved interest costs by around 230
basis points in terms of effective rate of interest.  The study calculated effective rate of interest
taking into account interest rate, maturity period and grace period.
It will be recalled that keeping in view the comfortable level of foreign exchange reserves
and soft interest rate regime both in domestic and international markets, the Government of India
has also prepaid certain high cost foreign currency loans from the Asian Development Bank
(ADB) amounting to US$1.36 billion (approximately) and from the World Bank amounting to
US$1.67 billion (approximately) on February 24, 2003 and February 27, 2003, respectively.
