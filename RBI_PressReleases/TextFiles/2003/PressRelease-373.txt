India’s External Debt at Quarter end-June 2003
September 30, 2003
• India’s external debt at US $ 109.6 billion as at end-June 2003, increased by US $ 5.0
billion (by 4.8 per cent) from US $ 104.6 billion as at end-March 2003.
• The increase in external debt during the quarter under review (April-June 2003) was
mainly on account of increase in NRI deposits (US $ 2.6 billion), external commercial
borrowings (US $ 1.1billion) and short-term trade credit (US $ 0.9 billion).
• The increase in NRI deposits by US $ 2.6 billion was mainly on account of an increase in
NRE deposits by US $ 2.7 billion as there was an outflow of US $ 0.1 billion in
FCNR(B) deposits. The increase in NRE deposits includes reinvestment of maturity
proceeds of NR(NR)RD scheme (which was discontinued with effect from April 1,
2002), of around US $ 0.4 billion.
• Increase in ECB reflected rise in borrowing by corporates in the face of low international
interest rates. Trade credit increase has been the result of sharp increase in India’s
imports.
• The largest component of India’s overall external debt as at end-June 2003 was
multilateral debt (accounting for 27.6 per cent), followed by NRI deposits (25.3 per cent),
external commercial borrowings (21.4 per cent), and bilateral debt   (15.5 per cent).
• Short-term debt increased significantly from US $ 4.6 billion as at end-March 2003 to US
$ 5.8 billion as at end-June 2003 due to increase in both components of short-term debt,
viz., NRI deposits and short-term trade credit.
•  The concessional debt as a proportion of total debt declined from 36.9 per cent as at end-
March 2003 to 35.5 per cent at end-June 2003.
• Despite considerable growth in short-term debt (27.7 per cent) during April-June 2003,
the proportion of such debt in the overall debt stock remains modest at 5.3 per cent.
