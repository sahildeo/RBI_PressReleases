Reserve Bank of India announces easing measures
February 28, 2003
In view of the current macroeconomic and overall monetary conditions, and
consistent with announcements made by the Finance Minister regarding certain
administered interest rates, it has been decided to reduce the interest rate on saving
accounts offered by banks to 3.5 per cent per annum from 4.0 per cent per annum. This
measure will be effective from March 1, 2003.
Simultaneously, the repo rate under the Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) of
the Reserve Bank of India to be made available on March 3, 2003 is also being reduced to
5.0 per cent from 5.5 per cent. Thereafter, as at present, the cut-off rate for acceptance of
bids for one day and 14 days repo will be decided by the Reserve Bank of India at each
auction.
Detailed operational guidelines/directives are being issued separately.
