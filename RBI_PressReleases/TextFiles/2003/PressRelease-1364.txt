Capital Account - Further Measures for Liberalisation
February 28, 2003
The Honourable Finance Minister has announced, inter alia, the following relaxations
relating to capital account transactions in the Union Budget for the year 2003-04.
Investment in Overseas JVs/WOSs
The automatic route of investments up to US$ 100 million will now be available to
Indian corporates with a proven track record for investments in overseas joint ventures (JVs)
or wholly owned subsidiaries (WOSs) even where the investment is not in the same core
activity as they are engaged in.  They will also be permitted to invest in such ventures up to
100 per cent of their net worth.
Indian corporates were so far permitted to invest under the automatic route in
overseas joint ventures/wholly owned subsidiaries engaged in the same core activity and up
to 50 per cent of their net worth. Core activity means activity carried on by an Indian entity,
which constituted at least 50 per cent of its average turnover.
Pre-payment of ECBs
Pre-payment of External Commercial Borrowings (ECBs) under the automatic route
would be permitted without any limit by removing the current ceiling of US$100 million.
Earlier any pre-payment out of market purchases beyond US$ 100 million required the prior
approval of the Reserve Bank.  This facility will be available until further notice, subject to
review.
The Reserve Bank of India has issued the necessary operative guidelines to the
Authorised Dealers. These relaxations will be effective from March 1, 2003.
