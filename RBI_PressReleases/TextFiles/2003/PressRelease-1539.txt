Exchange Facility for Public in Dadar
January 22, 2003
With a view to enlarging the exchange facility to the public, the Reserve Bank
of India has made special arrangement for distribution of packets of Rs.5 notes and
coins in Dadar. The facility will be offered on Friday, January 24, 2003 between
11.30 a.m. and 2.30 p.m. at Punjab National Bank, N. C. Kelkar Road, Dadar (West),

In order to make available clean currency notes to public in adequate quantity,
the Reserve Bank has taken several steps in the recent past. These include making
arrangements with the postal authorities in Mumbai for distribution of coins through
the post offices in Maharashtra and Goa and opening one currency chest branch on
one Sunday in a month at selected centers to exclusively provide currency exchange
and distribution of small coins and suck out the bad notes.
