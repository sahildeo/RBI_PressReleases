Exchange Facility for Public in Bandra
March 24, 2003
With a view to enlarging the exchange facility to the public, the Reserve Bank of
India has made special arrangement for distribution of packets of Rs.5 notes and coins
in Bandra. The facility will be offered on Wednesday, March 26, 2003 between 11.15
a.m. and 2.15 p.m. at State Bank of India, Linking Road, Bandra (West), Mumbai-400
052.
In order to make available clean currency notes to public in adequate quantity, the
Reserve Bank has taken several steps in the recent past. These include making
arrangements with the postal authorities in Mumbai for distribution of coins through
the post offices in Maharashtra and Goa and opening one currency chest branch on
one Sunday in a month at selected centers to exclusively provide currency exchange
and distribution of small coins and suck out the bad notes.
