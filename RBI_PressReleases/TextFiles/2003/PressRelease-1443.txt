Exchange Facility for Public in Fountain
February 12, 2003
With a view to enlarging the exchange facility to the public, the Reserve Bank of India
has made special arrangement for distribution of packets of Rs.5 notes and coins in Fountain.
The facility will be offered on Friday, February 14, 2003 between 10.30 a.m. and 1.30 p.m. at
Bank of India, Main Branch, M. G. Road, Fountain, Mumbai-400 001. The above branch will
also offer exchange facility of soiled and mutilated notes as part of the campaign.
In order to make available clean currency notes to public in adequate quantity, the
Reserve Bank has taken several steps in the recent past. These include making arrangements with
the postal authorities in Mumbai for distribution of coins through the post offices in Maharashtra
and Goa and opening one currency chest branch on one Sunday in a month at selected centers to
exclusively provide currency exchange and distribution of small coins and suck out the bad
notes.
