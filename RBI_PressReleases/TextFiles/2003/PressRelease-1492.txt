The notified amount for the next eight auctions of 91-day Treasury Bills to be

to Rs. 500 crore. These eight auctions would also be conducted by using multiple price
auction format. The position will be reviewed once again after these auctions. The notified
amount and the present format of auction of 364-day Treasury Bills will remain
unchanged.

The Reserve Bank of India retains the right to vary the amount and timing, if
circumstances warrant, without assigning any reason. The calendar is thus subject to
change, if circumstances so warrant, including for reasons such as intervening holidays.
Such changes, if any, will be communicated through regular press releases.
It may be recalled that the Reserve Bank had, on January 3, 2003, announced
continuation of the enhanced notified amount of Rs. 1,000 crore for four auctions of 91-
day Treasury Bills to be conducted during the period from January 8, 2003 to January 29,
2003. The experience in this regard was to be reviewed. The amount has been reduced to
Rs. 500 crore after the review was undertaken.
The auctions of treasury bills will be subject to the terms and conditions specified
in the General Notification No. F 2(12)- W&M/97dated March 31, 1998 issued by the
Government of India.
