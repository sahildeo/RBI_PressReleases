Keeping in view the declining interest rates scenario and the need to further
rationalise the interest rate structure under the Rural Infrastructure Development Fund
(RIDF), it has been decided, with the approval of the Government of India, to restructure the
lending and deposit rates in respect of the undisbursed amounts of RIDF-IV to IX with effect
from November 1, 2003. The revised rates are:
RIDF Interest rates on deposits Interest rates on loans payable

It may be recalled that the RIDF was established with the National Bank for
Agricultural and Rural Development in terms of Union Finance Minister’s Budget speech for
the year 1995-96 for assisting the State Governments and State owned corporations in quick
completion of on-going projects relating to minor and medium irrigation, soil conservation,
watershed management and other forms of rural infrastructure. Domestic scheduled
commercial banks, both in the public and private sector, are required to contribute to the
RIDF on the basis of their shortfall in lending to priority sector/ agriculture. So far, nine
tranches of RIDF have been established with aggregate corpus of Rs 34,000 crore. Thelending and deposit rates in respect of undisbursed amounts of RIDF IV to VII were last
restructured on October 1, 2003.
