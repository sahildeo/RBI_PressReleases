Nomination in favour of NRI by Investors in Savings Bonds
December 10, 2003
At present, non-resident Indians (NRIs) are not eligible to invest in 6.5 per cent
Savings Bond, 2003 (Non-Taxable) or 8 per cent Savings Bond (Taxable) nor can NRIs be
nominees. Requests have been received by the Bank for extension of the facility of
nomination of an NRI by the holders/investors in these bonds. The mater has been examined
and it has been decided that sole holder of the bond may nominate an NRI as his nominee in
respect of interest/redemption value of the investment in the bonds and the nomination will
be registered in the books of the Bank/agencies. The normal regulations in regard to the
foreign remittances as applicable to NRIs from time to time will continue to govern these
cases also.
