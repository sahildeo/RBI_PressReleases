Exchange Facility for Public in Pedder Road
June 26, 2003
With a view to enlarging the exchange facility to the public, the Reserve Bank of
India has made special arrangement for distribution of packets of Rs.5 notes and coins in
Pedder Road. The facility will be offered on Friday, June 27, 2003 between 11.30 a.m. and
2.30 p.m. at Allahabad Bank, Pedder Road,  Mumbai-400 026.
In order to make available clean currency notes to public in adequate quantity, the
Reserve Bank has taken several steps in the recent past. These include making arrangements
with the postal authorities in Mumbai for distribution of coins through the post offices in
Maharashtra and Goa and opening one currency chest branch on one Sunday in a month at
selected centers to exclusively provide currency exchange and distribution of small coins and
suck out the bad notes.
