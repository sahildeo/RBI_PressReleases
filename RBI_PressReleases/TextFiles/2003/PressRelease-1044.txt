May 17, 2003
The rate of interest on the Floating Rate Bonds, 2006 (FRB, 2006) applicable for the half
year May 22, 2003-November 21, 2003 shall be 5.29 per cent per annum.
It may be recalled that the rate of interest on the FRB, 2006 was set at a mark-up (as
decided in the auction held on November 21, 2001) over and above the variable base rate. It was
indicated that the variable base rate for payment of interest would be the average rate (rounded
off up to two decimal places) of the implicit yields at cut-off prices of the last six auctions of the
Government of India 364-day Treasury Bills held up to the commencement of the respective half
yearly coupon period. The variable base rate based on the average rate of the implicit yields at
cut-off prices of the last six auctions of the Government of India 364-day Treasury Bills held up
to May 17, 2003 works out to 5.34 per cent. The mark-up decided in the auction held on
November 21, 2001 was (-)0.05 (minus 0.05). The coupon rate has been fixed accordingly.
