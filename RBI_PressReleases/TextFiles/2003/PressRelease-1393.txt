Prepayment of ADB and IBRD Loans
February 24, 2003
Taking into account the strong foreign exchange position and low interest rates in the
domestic market, the Government of India has decided to prepay certain foreign currency
loans from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) amounting to US$1.30 billion (approx) and
from the World Bank amounting to US$1.67 billion (approx). The Government will purchase
the foreign currency required for the repayment directly from the Reserve Bank of India at
prevailing exchange rates. The Government will substitute this foreign debt with domestic
debt amounting to Rs.13,000 crore issued on private placement basis to the Reserve Bank of
India on February 24, 2003. The new debt issue will comprise two new securities, viz., 6.72
per cent Government Stock 2014 for an aggregate amount of Rs.5,500 crore, and 6.57 per
cent Government Stock 2011 for an aggregate amount of Rs.7,500 crore. Any residual
requirement of rupees will be met out of Government's cash holding. The date of repayment
of the external loans will be February 24, 2003 and February 27, 2003, respectively.
Since the fresh rupee borrowings by the Government (through private placements with the
Reserve Bank of India) will be used exclusively to retire an equivalent amount of debts in
foreign currency, with equivalent residual maturity, the transactions will not have any fiscal
implications. The monetary impact of the additional borrowing, through private placement,
will be neutralised by equivalent Rupee payment by Government of India to Reserve Bank of
India towards the purchase of foreign exchange. The reduction in the Reserve Bank's foreign
exchange assets will be matched by a corresponding increase in the domestic assets in the
form of Government securities acquired by way of private placements.
