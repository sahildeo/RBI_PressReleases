Overseas Corporate Entities owned by NRIs are on par with Foreign Investors : RBI
clarifies
September 18, 2003
Responding to queries, the RBI spokesperson clarified that the overseas entities
owned by Non-resident Indians (NRIs) can enjoy all the facilities available to any foreign
investor, including automatic route for foreign direct investment.
It may be recalled that the Reserve Bank of India, on September 16, 2003 had, in
consultation with the Government of India derecognised overseas corporate bodies (OCBs) in
India as an eligible class of investor under various rules and schemes available for foreign
investment. The Reserve Bank has clarified that derecognition of OCBs as a separate
category of investor meant withdrawal of special facilities made available to OCBs and that
entities owned by NRIs would continue to enjoy all the facilities available to other foreign
investors.
