Balance of Payments: Fourth Quarter (January-March 2003)
& Financial year 2002-03 (April-March): Salient Features
June 30, 2003
Background
The actual Balance of Payments (BoP) statistics have been compiled for the quarter
January-March 2003 and for the financial year 2002-03 (April-March). The quarterly
BoP data for 2002-03 for the quarters April-June, July-September and October-December
2002 have been revised taking into account latest data on exports, imports, software
exports, external assistance, external commercial borrowings and NRI deposits. Data for
2000-01 and 2001-02 are also revised, mostly due to enhanced coverage of FDI statistics
to approach the international best practices.
Revised BoP Data for Fiscal Years 2000-01 and 2001-02
BoP data for fiscal 2001-02 have been revised taking into account latest data on
exports, imports, software exports, external assistance, external commercial borrowings
and NRI deposits. In addition to these changes, the BoP data for 2000-01 and 2001-02
have undergone changes on account of compilation of FDI to approach the best
international practices, which take into account ‘equity capital of unincorporated entities’
‘reinvested earnings’ and ‘other capital’ (inter-corporate debt transactions between the
related entities) in addition to equity capital of FDI companies. In terms of standard
practice of BoP compilation, the above revision of FDI data would not affect India’s
overall BoP position for these two years.  However, there would be corresponding
changes in the composition of BoP.  These changes relate to investment income, external
commercial borrowings and errors and omissions.  In case of reinvested earnings, there
would be a contra entry (debit) of equal magnitude under investment income.  ‘Other
Capital’ reported as part of FDI inflow has been carved out from the figure reported
under external commercial borrowings by the same amount. ‘Other Capital’ by Indian
companies abroad and equity capital of unincorporated entities have been adjusted
against the errors and omissions.  Following the above methodology, appropriate
changes have been made in the current and capital account transactions of BoP.  As a
result, the current account surplus during 2001-02, which amounted to US $ 1.4 billion,
has been revised to US $ 0.8 billion.  Furthermore, the current account deficit during
2000-01 has increase from US $ 2.6 billion to US $ 3.6 billion.
Salient Features of BoP position during 2002-03
The BoP data for fiscal 2000-01 to 2002-03 in Rupees crore are in Statement 1 and
in US Dollar million in Statement 2. As indicated earlier, the data on FDI have been
revised since 2000-01 with expanded coverage, which include equity capital, reinvested
earnings, and ‘other capital’ to approach the international best practices. Data on
reinvested earnings for 2002-03 are provided as advance estimate, which are average of
the previous two years, as contemporaneous data are not available. Similarly, data on
equity capital for unincorporated entities (banks) have been estimated as the average of
the previous two years. These data would be revised when firm data become available
with a time lag of one year.2
The salient features of the developments relating to BoP for the fourth quarter of
2002-03 as well as for the full fiscal year 2002-03 are set out in the following paragraphs.
Quarterly BoP: January-March 2003
• On the payments basis, merchandise exports and imports were US $ 14.6 billion
and US $ 17.3 billion, respectively, during January-March 2003 quarter as
compared with US $ 12.3 billion and US $ 14.6 billion in the corresponding
period of the previous year. As a result, the trade deficit has increased to US $ 2.7
billion in the quarter under review compared with US $ 2.3 billion during the
same period last year.
• Services (net) receipts at US $ 1.1 billion were lower than that of US $ 1.7 billion
in January-March 2002.
• Private transfer (net) receipts at US $ 3.4 billion were modestly higher than that of
US $ 3.2 billion in January-March 2002.
• The current account balance registered a surplus of US $ 1.0 billion as compared
with a surplus of US $ 2.2 billion in January-March 2002. The lower current
account surplus can be attributed to higher growth in imports and lower receipts
on services account.
• FDI inflows at US $ 0.6 billion were lower than that of US $ 1.2 billion in
January-March 2002. Portfolio investment registered a net inflow of US $ 0.6
billion as compared with a net inflow of US $ 0.7 billion in January-March 2002.
• Net inflows on account of non-resident deposits were lower at US $ 437 million
than US $ 500 million in January-March 2002.
• Under banking capital (excluding NRI deposits), net assets of the commercial
banks (which mainly include foreign currency holdings, investment in securities,
fixed deposits and loans) increased by US $ 1,007 million in January-March 2003
as against US $ 955 million in January-March 2002. The net liability position
(which mainly include inter-bank borrowings) remained almost unchanged.
• Other capital which include items such as delayed export receipts, funds held
abroad, India’s subscription to international institutions etc., increased by US $
1028 million as against US $ 98 million in January-March 2002.
• Overall balance showed a net inflow of US $ 4.3 billion during January-March
2003 compared with an inflow of US $ 6.2 billion in January-March 2002.
BOP for 2002-03 (April-March)
• On the payments basis, the merchandise exports and imports were US $ 53.0
billion and US $ 65.5 billion, respectively during 2002-03 (as compared with US
$ 44.9 billion and US $ 57.6 billion during 2001-02).
• Trade deficit on payments basis was marginally lower at US $ 12.5 billion than
that of US $ 12.7 billion in the previous year.3
• Net earnings from invisibles were higher at US $ 16.2 billion than that of US $
13.5 billion in the previous year. This was mainly due to increase in services
(around US $ 1.6 billion) and private transfers (US $ 2.3 billion).  The increase in
services exports was mainly on account of rise in software exports (around US $ 2
billion).
• The current account balance recorded a higher surplus at US $ 3.7 billion
(provisional) as compared with US $ 0.8 billion (partially revised) in the previous
year.
• Foreign direct investment (FDI) to India was US $ 4.7 billion in 2002-03 as
against US $ 6.1 billion in 2001-02.  Similarly, FDI abroad by Indian companies
was US $ 1.0 billion in 2002-03 as against US $ 1.4 billion in the previous year.
Therefore, the net FDI in India was US $ 3.6 billion in 2002-03 compared with
US $ 4.7 billion in 2001-02.
• The total portfolio investment was lower at US $ 0.9 billion in 2002-03 than US $
1.9 billion recorded in 2001-02.
• Net inflows under non-resident deposits at US $ 2.8 billion were almost at same
level as in the previous year.
• Net inflow under banking capital excluding NRI deposits at US $ 5.4 billion was
higher than that of US $ 2.8 billion in 2001-02. This increase in banking capital
(excluding NRI deposits) was due to (net) increase in assets of commercial banks
by US $ 2.6 billion. The (net) liability position, however, witnessed a marginal
decline from US $ 0.4 billion in 2001-02 to US $ 0.3 billion in 2002-03.
• Other capital, comprising leads and lags in export receipts, funds held abroad,
India’s subscription to international institutions etc., amounted to US $ 3.5 billion
in 2002-03 as compared with US $ 0.2 billion during 2001-02. The bulk of this
increase (US $ 3.2 billion) was on account of leads and lags in export receipts.
• Overall balance showed a surplus of US $ 17.0 billion in 2002-03 compared with
a surplus of US $ 11.8 billion in 2001-02, excluding valuation changes.
• The increase in foreign currency reserves, including valuation changes but
excluding gold, was US $ 20.8 billion in 2002-03 as compared with US $ 11.6
billion in the previous year. Thus, the valuation changes amounted to US $ 3.8
billion during fiscal 2002-03 as against (-) US $ 0.2 billion in the previous year.
