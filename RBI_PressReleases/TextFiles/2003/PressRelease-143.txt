RBI Guidelines on Non-SLR Investments:
Extension of Time for compliance
November 25, 2003
It may be recalled that in consonance with the guidelines issued by the Securities and
Exchange Board of India (SEBI) on privately placed corporate debt securities on September 30,
2003, the Reserve Bank of India issued guidelines for non-SLR investments by banks on
November 12, 2003.
While the guidelines have been welcomed by market participants as desirable, they urged
that they needed time to develop appropriate procedures and adjust their portfolios to be in full
conformity with the guidelines.
It has, therefore, been decided to extend the time for compliance up to March 31, 2004.
Consequently the guidelines will come into effect from April 1, 2004.
Market participants are advised to initiate the process of compliance immediately.
