Liberalization in booking of forward contracts
April 1, 2003
Presently, resident entities are allowed to book forward contracts up to the extent of
average of past three years export/import turnover without production of documents, subject
to the condition that at any point of time, the outstanding forward contracts shall not exceed
25 per cent of the eligible limit, subject to a cap of USD 100 million.
To enable large corporates with proven track record to effectively and actively
manage their risks arising out of genuine exposures relating to export/import transactions and
in response to representations received in this regard, it has been decided to allow higher
limits on application by corporates, in excess of USD 100 million, for booking forward
contracts based on past performance for hedging purposes on “deliverable” basis.
Those entities, desirous of availing of higher limit may apply through their authorised
dealer, justifying therein the need for the higher limit, to the Chief General Manager, Reserve
Bank of India, Exchange Control Department, Forex Market Division, Central Office,
Mumbai 400 001 (Fax 2261 1427. E mail: ecdcofmd@rbi.org.in). The application should
inter alia contain details of past three years turnover, delayed realizations/payments and the
limits fixed for booking forward contracts based on past performance.
This facility will be available until further notice. Necessary instructions are being
issued to the authorised dealers.
