RBI resets rate of interest on FRBs 2009 at 5.16 per cent
June 6, 2003
The rate of interest on the Floating Rate Bonds, 2009 (FRB, 2009) applicable for the
half year June 6, 2003-December 5, 2003 shall be 5.16 per cent per annum.
As decided in the auction of FRB, 2009 held on December 5, 2001, the rate of interest
on the FRB, 2009 was set at a mark-up over and above the variable base rate. The variable
base rate for payment of interest was to the average rate (rounded off up to two decimal
places) of the implicit yields at cut-off prices of the last six auctions of the Government of
India's 364-day Treasury Bills held up to the commencement of the respective half- yearly
coupon period. The variable base rate based on the average rate of the implicit yields at cut-
off prices of the last six auctions of the Government of India's 364-day Treasury Bills held up
to June 5, 2003 works out to 5.17 per cent. The mark-up decided in the auction held on
December 5, 2001 was (-) 0.01 (minus 0.01). The coupon rate has thus been fixed at 5.16 per
cent.
