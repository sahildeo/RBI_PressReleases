Major sources of accretion to foreign exchange reserves during April-June 2003 have
been:
• Foreign investment (41.8 per cent); comprising FDI (11.9 per cent) and portfolio
investment (29.9 per cent);
• Banking capital, which includes NRI deposits (25.4 per cent) and changes in foreign
assets and other liabilities of commercial banks (3.0 per cent);
• Short-term credit (13.4 per cent);
• Other items under capital account which mainly reflect the difference between custom
data on imports/exports and banking channel data (US $ 0.8 billion), funds held abroad2
(- US $ 0.3 billion), external assistance (- US $ 0.3 billion), rupee debt service (- US $
0.3 billion) and errors and omissions (US $ 0.3 billion) accounted for 3.0 per cent; and
• Valuation gain in reserves of US $ 1.5 billion (22.4 per cent).
It may be noted that significant changes are observed in the pattern of flows during the
quarter April-June 2003 from those during the period April-June 2002:
• There has been a shift in the current account balance. The current account, which has
been showing a surplus position since the third quarter of fiscal 2001-02 has turned into
a deficit during April-June 2003. The extent of deficit during April-June 2003 was US $
1.2 billion as against a surplus of US $ 0.4 billion during April-June 2002.
• There has been a significant rise in the net inflows through the capital account heads at
US $ 6.4 billion as against US $ 1.3 billion in April-June 2002.
• There has been increase in capital flows from investment in debt securities, external
commercial borrowings, short-term credit and non-resident deposits.
• Valuation changes, reflecting the appreciation of the Euro, GBP and Yen against the US
dollar, accounted for US $ 1.5 billion of accretion to total reserves in April-June 2003
as against a valuation gain of US $ 2.0 billion in April-June 2002. While the Reserve
Bank denominates its forex reserves in terms of US dollars, these comprise a basket of
major international currencies, particularly US dollar, Euro and Pound Sterling.
Accordingly, when non-US dollar currencies appreciate in terms of US dollar, there is
accretion to reserves by way of valuation gains. The reverse is the case when these
currencies depreciate against the US dollar. During the period under review, Euro and
GBP had appreciated substantially against the US dollar.   (This is excluding the
appreciation of value of gold, which is not considered for compilation of balance of
payments).
