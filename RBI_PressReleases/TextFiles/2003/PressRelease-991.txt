May 28, 2003
With a view to enlarging the exchange facility to the public, the Reserve Bank of
India has made special arrangement for distribution of packets of Rs.5 notes and coins in
Goregaon (West). The facility will be offered on Friday, May 30, 2003 between 11.30 a.m.
and 2.30 p.m. at Bank of Baroda, Shanjay Building, Road No.111, Jawahar Nagar, Mumbai.
In order to make available clean currency notes to public in adequate quantity, the
Reserve Bank has taken several steps in the recent past. These include making arrangements
with the postal authorities in Mumbai for distribution of coins through the post offices in
Maharashtra and Goa and opening one currency chest branch on one Sunday in a month at
selected centers to exclusively provide currency exchange and distribution of small coins and
suck out the bad notes.
