No Repo Rate cut Now : RBI
June 6, 2003
We do not expect to make a repo cut now or for quite sometime, until the monsoon
and inflation situation becomes clearer. There has been renewed market speculation on this
issue in the light of the 50 basis point cut made by the European Central Bank yesterday. The
rate of inflation in the main Euro countries is in the range of 2 per cent compared to our
inflation rate which was 5.9 per cent on May 17, 2003, an official spokesperson of the
Reserve Bank of India clarified.
