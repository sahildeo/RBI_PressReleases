Revised Data on Foreign Direct Investment
June 30, 2003
I. Background
In the recent past, there have been discussions in various fora regarding the coverage
of foreign direct investment (FDI) statistics in India, which mainly include equity capital, vis-
à-vis the data published by some other countries which include equity capital, reinvested
earnings (retained earnings of FDI companies) and other capital (inter-corporate debt
transaction between related entities).
In an effort to bring the reporting system of FDI data in India into alignment with
international best practices, the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion ( DIPP),
Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Government of India (GoI), in consultation with the
Reserve Bank of India, constituted a committee in May 2002. The Committee comprised
officials from the Reserve Bank and the DIPP. The Committee studied the relevant
conceptual and methodological issues and identified the data gaps involved in order to make
necessary recommendations for strengthening the collection, compilation and reporting of
FDI data.  The Committee submitted its Report in October 2002 recommending that the FDI
statistics should include, besides equity capital, ‘reinvested earnings’ (retained earnings of
FDI companies) and ‘other direct capital’ (inter-corporate debt transactions between related
entities) in accordance with the international best practices. The Committee also
recommended that the steps be taken jointly by the Reserve Bank and the DIPP to expand the
coverage of FDI statistics in India.
As a follow-up action to the submission of FDI Compilation Report, a Technical
Monitoring Group (TMG) was constituted by DIPP in November 2002 for speedy
implementation of the recommendations made by the Committee. The TMG had
representatives from the Reserve Bank, DIPP, Department of Economic Affairs ( DEA),
Department of Company Affairs (DCA) and National Informatics Centre (NIC).  The main
focus of the TMG was to identify various components of FDI, which are operationally
feasible and capture these components in a specified institutional framework and within a
specified time period. TMG submitted its first Action Taken Report on June 27, 2003.
II. Proposed Coverage of FDI to India
After reviewing the international best practices as also some select country
experiences, the TMG concluded that inclusion of fourteen items in Indian FDI data under
three major heads would, by and large, comply with the reporting system in line with
international best practices.  The items were:
A. Equity Capital
(1)Equity capital of unincorporated entities;
(2) Non-cash acquisition against technology transfer, plant and machinery,
goodwill, business development and similar considerations;
(3) Control premium;
(4) Non-competition fees.2
B. Reinvested Earnings
(5) Reinvested earnings of incorporated entities;
(6) Reinvested earnings of unincorporated entities;
(7) Reinvested earnings of indirectly held direct investment enterprises.
C. ‘Other capital’
(8) Short-term and long-term inter-corporate borrowings;
(9) Trade credit;
(10) Suppliers credit;
(11) Financial leasing;
(12) Financial derivatives;
(13) Debt securities; and
(14) Land and buildings.
Against this background, the Reserve Bank and the DIPP jointly decided to expand
the coverage of data on FDI, both inflow and outflow for 2000-01 and 2001-02. The revised
data on FDI include all items indicated under equity capital (except non-cash acquisitions).
The equity capital of unincorporated entities (Item no. 1 above) includes the equity capital of
foreign banks’ branches in India.  All items under the reinvested earnings have been included
except reinvested earnings of indirectly held direct investment enterprises.  Data under ‘Other
Capital’ relate to short-term and long-term borrowing, trade credit (more than 180 days),
suppliers’ credit (more than 180 days), and financial leasing.
Thus, in this exercise, out of fourteen items, the FDI data do not include the following
six items, viz., (i) non-cash acquisitions, (ii) reinvested earnings of indirectly held direct
investment enterprises, (iii) short-term trade credit,  (iv) financial derivatives, (v) debt
securities and (vi) land and buildings. The TMG is exploring the feasibility of including these
items in future.
III. Proposed coverage of FDI by India
Figures in respect of FDI by India (Indian investment abroad), so far reported in the
BoP statistics, comprised mainly the equity component similar to the treatment given to FDI
inflows into India.  Since the data on FDI to India are being revised according to the best
international practices, there was a need to compile corresponding data on Indian investment
abroad.  Accordingly, comparable data on Indian investment abroad that include equity
capital, reinvested earnings and ‘other capital’ have been compiled for fiscal 2000-01 and
2001-02.
IV. Current Revision of Data on FDI
In line with the explanation given above, the revised data (which are at present
provisional) for 2000-01 and 2001-02 are shown in Tables 1 and 2.

V. Implications for the Balance of Payments
In terms of standard practice of BoP compilation, the above revision of FDI data
would not affect India’s overall BoP position for these two years.  In other words, the
accretion to the foreign exchange reserves would not undergo any change. The composition
of BoP, however, would undergo changes.  These changes relate to investment income,
external commercial borrowings and errors and omissions.  In case of reinvested earnings,
there would be a contra entry (debit) of equal magnitude under investment income in the
current account.  ‘Other Capital’ reported as part of FDI inflow has been carved out from the
figure reported under external commercial borrowings by the same amount. ‘Other Capital’
by Indian companies abroad and equity capital of unincorporated entities have been adjusted
against the errors and omissions.  Following the above methodology, appropriate changes
have been made in the current and capital account transactions of BoP.  As a result, the
current account surplus during 2001-02, which amounted to US $ 1.4 billion, has been
revised to a surplus of US $ 0.8 billion. Furthermore, the current account deficit during 2000-
01 has increased from US $ 2.6 billion to US $ 3.6 billion. This is mainly on account of
adjustment of reinvested earnings as a contra entry in the investment income as explained
above. The other major change is the reduction in errors and omissions in both the years. In
net terms, the errors and omissions have been revised from US $ (-) 588 million to US $ (-)
572 million during 2000-01 and from US $ 860 million to US $ 403 million during 2001-02.
The detailed BoP data revised as per above have been released in a separate RBI press note
issued on June 30, 2003.
VI. Future Course of Action
In future, reinvested earnings and equity capital of unincorporated bodies would be
included in FDI data on an annual basis, as these data are culled out from the balance sheets
of the FDI companies.  Every year these data would become available with a time lag of one
year e.g., data for 2002-03 would be available by June 2004.  Consequently, for these items,4
advance estimates will be incorporated in the BoP data until firm data become available with
a time lag of one year.
For 2002-03, the data on reinvested earnings are estimated as the average of the
previous two years of 2000-01 and 2001-02. In the future as well, there will be a regular one-
year lag in the reporting of reinvested earnings. ‘Other Capital’ could be captured on a
quarterly basis and would be reported together with quarterly dissemination of BoP statistics.
The estimates for data on FDI for 2002-03 in the line of figures indicated in Tables 1 and 2
are presented in Tables 3 and 4.

The Reserve Bank and the DIPP would jointly continue to monitor the compilation of
FDI statistics through TMG until the reporting system relating to remaining items of FDI is
stabilised.
