RBI asks NBFCs to hold G-secs
for Regulatory Compliance in  a separate demat account
July 31, 2003
The Reserve Bank of India has today directed Non-banking finance companies
(NBFCs), including Residuary non-banking companies (RNBCs) to hold government
securities in a separate demat account and not to trade in them if they are held towards
compliance of the Reserve Bank Regulations.  They should, if necessary, hold government
securities for trading purposes in a second demat account.
In a notification issued today, the Reserve Bank has directed NBFCs and RNBCs to
maintain two constituent subsidiary general ledger (CSGL) accounts or two demat accounts
or one CSGL account and one demat account, for holding the Government securities required
for compliance with the Reserve Bank Regulations in an exclusive CSGL account or demat
account, and not trade in them in any manner. For the purpose of trading, the securities held
in excess of the Reserve Bank requirement in compliance with Section 45-IB of the Reserve
Bank of India Act are required to be kept in the second CSGL account or demat account.
NBFCs have also been directed that they should, under no circumstances, use the
CSGL account or demat account maintained for the purpose of compliance with the Reserve
Bank's regulatory requirements (Section 45-IB of the Reserve Bank of India Act) for any
other purpose.
It may be recalled that in October 2002, NBFCs including RNBCs were directed to
dematerialise the Government securities held in compliance with the provisions of Section
45-IB of the Reserve Bank of India Act. They were also advised not to undertake any
transaction in these securities in physical form with any broker.  Further, the Reserve Bank
has permitted NBFCs to enter into ready forward contracts in gilts (including reverse ready
forward contracts) subject to certain conditions.
