(except Regional Rural Banks) and scheduled primary cooperative banks. There are Banking

informal group constituted by the Reserve Bank reviewed the Scheme. The revised Banking
Ombudsman Scheme, 2002 came into effect on June 14, 2002. The new Scheme covers all
the Regional Rural Banks in addition to all commercial banks and scheduled primary
cooperative banks. The new Scheme additionally provides for an institution of a "Review
Authority" to review the Ombudsman's Award. The Banking Ombudsman has now also been
authorised to function as an arbitrator for disputes between banks and their customers or
between two banks. The value of the subject matter of individual disputes under arbitration
should not exceed Rs. ten lakh.
