The Reserve Bank of India has advised income-tax assessees in the cities of Mumbai

bank branches. The income-tax department has authorised approximately 820 computerised
branches of public sector banks and HDFC Bank in Mumbai and Navi Mumbai to accept
payment of income-tax dues. The Reserve Bank has also advised income-tax assessees to
avoid last minute rush at the Reserve Bank's/designated banks' counters and to deposit the
income-tax dues sufficiently in advance.
