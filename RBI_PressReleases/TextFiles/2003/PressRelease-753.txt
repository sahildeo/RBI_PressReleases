Ceiling on Interest Rate on NRE Deposits
July 17, 2003
In order to provide consistency in the interest rates offered to non-resident Indians, it
has been decided that, until further notice, the interest rates on fresh repatriable Non-Resident
(External) Rupee (NRE) deposits for one to three years contracted effective July 17, 2003
should not exceed 250 basis points above the LIBOR/SWAP rates for US dollar of
corresponding maturity. For purposes of operational convenience, the interest rates could be
rounded off to the nearest decimal point. For example, a computed interest rate of 3.67 per
cent would become 3.7 per cent, and 3.64 per cent would become 3.6 per cent.
The maturity period of repatriable NRE deposits would continue to be one to three
years and the interest rate as determined above for three year deposits would also be
applicable in case the maturity period exceeds three years.
The changes in interest rates will also apply to repatriable NRE deposits renewed after
their present maturity period.
At present, banks can offer Foreign Currency Non-Resident {FCNR(B)} deposits in
foreign currency and NRE deposits in domestic currency to non-resident Indians. NRE
deposits are now fully repatriable. The interest rates on FCNR(B) deposits are subject to a
ceiling of LIBOR/SWAP rates for the corresponding maturities minus 25 basis points, and
generally conform to global interest rates in foreign currency deposits in US dollar, pound
sterling, euro etc; whereas interest rates offered by banks on NRE deposits are more or less
on par with interest rates on domestic rupee deposits.
