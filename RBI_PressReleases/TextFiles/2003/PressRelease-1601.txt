Stock Broking Companies
January 9, 2003
In supersession of its earlier directions exempting all stock broking companies registered
with Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) from the core provisions of the Reserve
Bank of India Act, the Reserve Bank of India has, in consultation with the SEBI, exempted
those Stock Broking Companies which are holding a certificate of registration obtained from
SEBI under Section 12 of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 and are not
holding or accepting public deposits, from the requirement of registration with Reserve Bank
of India, maintenance of liquid assets and creation of special reserve fund under Sections 45-
IA, 45-IB, 45-IC respectively and 45MB and 45MC of the Reserve Bank of India Act, as also
from the  directions of Reserve Bank on acceptance of public deposits and prudential norms
for NBFCs.
The applications of such of those stock broking companies, which have applied to the
Reserve Bank of India for issue of Certificate of Registration and which are not holding
public deposits will, therefore, be treated as withdrawn.
The relative notification and circular are available on RBI web-site at rbi.org.in
