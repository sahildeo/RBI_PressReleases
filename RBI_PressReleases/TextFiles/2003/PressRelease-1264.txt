Guidelines for Uniform Accounting for
Repo/Reverse Repo Transactions
The Reserve Bank of India has, in consultation with Fixed Income Money Markets
and Derivatives Association of India (FIMMDA), issued guidelines on uniform accounting
policies to be followed by banks, primary dealers and other entities regulated by the Reserve
Bank. In the accounting guidelines, the legal character of the repo transaction under the
current law, viz., as outright purchase and outright sale transactions, has been kept intact
while reflecting the substance of repo as a funding transaction. The Reserve Bank has,
however, clarified that, for the present, these norms would not apply to repo/reverse repo
transactions under the Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) with the Reserve Bank.
The Reserve Bank has also requested other regulatory agencies, viz., Security and
Exchange Board of India (SEBI), Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA)
and National Housing Bank (NHB) to advise entities regulated by them to follow similar
accounting policies. The Reserve Bank has also advised the regulated entities to consider
entering into bilateral Master Repo Agreement as per the documentation finalised by
FIMMDA to obviate disputes arising out of repo transactions.
Currently there are divergent practices prevailing among the market participants for
accounting of repo/reverse repo transactions. In order to ensure uniform accounting treatment
in this regard and to impart transparency so as to widen and broaden the repo market, it was
decided to lay down uniform accounting principles for repo/reverse repo transactions
undertaken by all the regulated entities.
A copy of the circular issued in this regard is available in the RBI website
(www.rbi.org.in).
