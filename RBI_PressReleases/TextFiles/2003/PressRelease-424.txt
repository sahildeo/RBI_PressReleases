Selling of gilts by banks: Clarification
September 19, 2003
It has been reported in a section of the press that the Reserve Bank of India has
banned banks from selling government securities from the Available for Sale (AFS) category
on the same day they buy securities on their trading account.
This is not in consonance with factual position. The Reserve Bank has not issued any
directive or any clarificatory circular to banks regarding sale of securities from the AFS
category.
Possible misinterpretation may be on account of Fixed Income Money Market and
Derivatives Association of India's (FIMMDA) seeking clarification from the Reserve Bank
regarding booking of profit / loss on purchase / sale of securities based on the category in
which the securities bought and sold are classified in the books of accounts of the bank. In
response, the Reserve Bank had clarified to FIMMDA the accounting aspects of such
transactions. The Reserve Bank's clarification to FIMMDA neither conveys nor implies any
ban on sale of securities from the AFS category.
