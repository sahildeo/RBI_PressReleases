Parliamentary Committee on Security Market Scam. In the light of the said review, after
taking all relevant aspects into account, it has been decided in consultation with the
Government, that henceforth, OCBs shall not be permitted to make fresh investment under
FDI scheme (including automatic route) and in other investments / deposits / loans under the
various routes / schemes available to the non-residents under the extant Exchange Control
Regulations. Further, the facility of opening and maintaining fresh Non-Resident (External)
Accounts (NRE) (Savings, Current, Recurring or Fixed), Foreign Currency (Non-Resident)
