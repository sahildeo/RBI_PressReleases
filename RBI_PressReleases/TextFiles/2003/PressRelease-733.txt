Government of India’s Debt Buyback Programme Auction : Results
The Ministry of Finance, in cooperation with the Reserve Bank of India took
yet another innovative step today.  The first ever buy back auction of high coupon,
relatively illiquid government securities was completed by the Reserve Bank of India
today, at 2 p.m.  In all 131 offers were received, amounting to a total of Rs. 14,434
crore (face value).  As these were at or above the minimum discount of 7.5 per cent,
they have been accepted by the Government.
The market value of these securities bought back, amounts to Rs. 19,394
crore.  In lieu of the securities repurchased, Government will simultaneously reissue
four liquid securities, of the equivalent face value of Rs. 14,434 crore, to the
Banks/Institutions whose offers were accepted.
There are many noteworthy aspects of this auction.  This was an entirely
voluntary auction.  It was open, on-line and the auction itself was electronic.  Of great
significance is also the fact that this is a pioneering effort at internal debt
restructuring by the Government.
Security wise details of the transactions are provided in the Annexure.
