Back stop Facility - Fixation of rate
April 29, 2003
Currently banks and primary dealers are eligible for standing facilities from the
Reserve Bank of India subject to certain limits. These are split into `normal' and `back-stop'
facilities. While normal facility will continue to be at Bank Rate, the methodology for
fixation of the rates for Back-stop facility has been revised. Effective from April 30, 2003,
the back-stop interest rates will be fixed as under :
• The `back-stop' interest rate will be at the reverse repo cut-off rate at which funds
were injected earlier during the day in the regular LAF auctions.
• Where no reverse repo bid is accepted as part of LAF auction, the `back-stop' interest
rate will generally be 2.0 percentage points over the repo cut-off rate of the day under
LAF.
• On the days when no bids for repo or reverse repo auctions are received/accepted, the
`back-stop' interest rate will be decided by the Reserve Bank of India on an ad hoc
basis.
