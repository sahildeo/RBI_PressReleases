Rural Infrastructure Development Fund (RIDF) IV to VII – Rates of Interest
September 19, 2003
The domestic Scheduled Commercial banks, both in the public and private sector are required to
contribute an amount equivalent to the extent of shortfall in achieving the priority sector lending
target / agriculture lending target to Rural Infrastructure Development Fund (RIDF). The RIDF
was established with NABARD in terms of Union Finance Minister’s Budget speech for the year
1995-96 for assisting the State Governments and State owned Corporations in quick completion
of on-going projects relating to minor and medium irrigation, soil conservation, watershed
management and other forms of rural infrastructure. It has been decided to restructure the
lending and deposit rates, after due consultation, in respect of undisbursed amounts of RIDF IV
to VII with effect from October 1, 2003. Accordingly, the State Governments will be required to
pay 9% (nine per cent) on the undisbursed amount of the above tranches, while the banks will be
paid 8% (eight per cent) on their contribution to RIDF IV to VII uniformly. Suitable instructions
have been issued to all banks in the matter.
