RBI permits RCS to wind up Charotar Nagarik Sahakari Bank Ltd., Anand
August 19, 2003
Considering the irretrievable and weak financial condition and all other relevant
factors, the Reserve Bank of India has granted permission to the Registrar of Co-operative
Societies (RCS), Gujarat to wind up the Charotar Nagarik Sahakari Bank Ltd., Anand. As
such, it would not be permissible for the bank, among other things, to accept deposit from
public.
The Reserve Bank's permission is in exercise of the power conferred on it under
Section 13D of Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation Act, 1961 and under
sub-section (1) of Section 115A of Gujarat Co-operative Societies Act, 1961.
