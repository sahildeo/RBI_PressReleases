Monitoring of Investment by Non Residents under
Portfolio Investment Scheme – Threshold Limit
As a measure of further liberalization and to facilitate increased floating stock of shares of
large Indian companies having equity base of Rs.1,000 crore and above, it has been decided to
enhance the threshold limit, beyond which Foreign Institutional Investors/Non Resident Indians
investing in these companies are required to obtain prior clearance from the Reserve Bank.
Accordingly, this threshold limit is now fixed at 0.5 per cent below the limit upto which non-
resident investments are permitted in such companies. This is expected to lead to better price
discovery for investors.
Presently, this limit is at 2 per cent below the applicable limits.
Revised operating instructions are being issued to the designated banks.
