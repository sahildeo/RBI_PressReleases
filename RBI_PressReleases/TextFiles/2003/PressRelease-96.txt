FAQs on OCBs on RBI site
December 8, 2003
Consequent to the derecognition of Overseas Corporate Bodies (OCBs) as an investor class,
the Reserve Bank of India has been receiving several queries from the public. OCBs were
derecognised as an investor class with effect from September 16, 2003. Queries have been
relating to seeking clarifications on various operational issues associated with the transitional
arrangements for OCBs. With a view to clarifying the stance on these issues, the Reserve
Bank has prepared frequently asked questions (FAQs). The FAQs are available on the
Reserve Bank’s website at (www.faqs.rbi.org.in). Any query not answered in these FAQs
may be sent to the Reserve Bank at mrajeshwarrao@rbi.org.in
