October 1, 2003
It has come to the notice of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) that one M/s. S. V.
Management Consultants Pvt. Ltd., has published an advertisement in a leading financial
daily in Chennai claiming that it is an RBI approved arranger for external commercial
borrowing.
The Reserve Bank clarifies that it does not approve such agents.
Members of the public are, therefore, advised to be cautious of such
misrepresentations and to bring such instances to the notice of the Reserve Bank.
