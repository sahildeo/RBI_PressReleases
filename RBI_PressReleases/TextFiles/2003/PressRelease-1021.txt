Non-Resident Indian Deposits: Arbitrage Opportunities
May 22, 2003
In the context of India’s strong foreign exchange position and the recent appreciation of
the Rupee vis-à-vis US Dollar, there has been some discussion in the media and among bankers
that inflows into non-resident Indian (NRI) deposit have been taking place in order to take
advantage of arbitrage opportunities. The arbitrage opportunities are possible on account of
higher domestic rupee interest rates than the Dollar/Euro interest rates abroad.
The provisional data on various components NRI deposits for the full fiscal year of 2002-
03, as compiled by the Department of Economic Analysis and Policy (DEAP), Reserve Bank of
India, are now available and are in Table 1.
Table 1 : Net Inflows under Various Non-Resident  Deposit Schemes
(In US$ million)
Items 2001-2002 2002-2003
(I) Dollar Accounts:
FCNR(B) 594 520
(II)Rupee Accounts: (a+b) 2134 2284
(a) NRE 1626 5988
(b) NRNR 508 - 3704
Total: (I+II) 2728 2804
It may be noted that Rupee accounts as shown in Table 1 include inflows into Non-
Resident (External) Rupee Accounts (NRE account) as well as Non-Resident (Non- Repatriable)
Rupee Deposits (NRNR account). It may be recalled that the NRNR account was discontinued
effective April 1, 2002 with a view to providing full convertibility of NRI deposit schemes. The
existing accounts of NRNR Deposits were permitted to continue up to the date of maturity. The
maturity proceeds of the NRNR deposits could be credited to the account holders’ NRE account.
As it may be seen from Table 1, the inflows into total NRI rupee deposits during fiscal
2002-03 amounted to US$ 2,804 million, which were only marginally higher than the US$ 2,728
million in the previous year. Thus, there is no significant increase in the inflows. In view of the
discontinuation of NRNR deposits during 2002-03, there has been an outflow of US$ 3,704
million from these accounts into NRE account.
The trend has been similar even during the last quarter of the fiscal year 2002-03
(January-March) when the dollar was depreciating against the Rupee. The inflows into NRI
deposits during this period amounted to only US$ 434 million, marginally lower than US$ 474
million during the same period last year.
Furthermore, as announced in the Monetary and Credit Policy for the year 2003-04, the
minimum maturity period of the fresh NRE deposits has been increased from six months to oneyear similar to FCNR(B) deposits. Thus, inflows of so-called "hot money" or "short term funds"
by way of NRI deposits are not expected.
Note for information:
As announced earlier, the Reserve Bank of India will also issue a press release on the sources of
accretion to foreign exchange reserves for fiscal 2002-03 after the Balance of Payments data for
the full year 2002-03 are available in June 2003.
