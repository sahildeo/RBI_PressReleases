The Reserve Bank of India will hold four-day repo and reverse repo auctions on March 13,

declaring March 14, 2003 as holiday, in place of March 15, 2003, on account of the last day
of Moharrum under the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881.
In its press release of December 31, 2002, the Reserve Bank of India had stated that it
would hold one- day repo and reverse repo auctions on March 13 and three-day repo and
reverse repo auctions on March 14, 2003. Both these auctions stand cancelled.
