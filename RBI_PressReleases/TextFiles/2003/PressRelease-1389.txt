RBI Appeal to Tax Payers
February 25, 2003
To avoid long queues and inconveniences for payment of income tax (IT) at
the Reserve Bank counters, the Reserve Bank of India has appealed to the tax
payers to utilise the services available at various branches of public sector banks in
Mumbai and Navi Mumbai and deposit their income tax dues well in advance of the
last date.
Income Tax Assessees can now pay advance income tax at any of the 820
branches of public sector banks and HDFC Bank at Mumbai and Navi Mumbai. The
designated branches are authorised by the Income Tax Department to accept
payment of income tax dues. Assessees are  advised to take advantage of these
standing arrangements made for their convenience.
