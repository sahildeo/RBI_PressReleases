Data on Banks' Lending Rates on RBI Website
February 25,2003
The Reserve Bank of India has started publishing the data on lending rates of scheduled
commercial banks on its website ({ HYPERLINK http://www.rbi.org.in }). The data, released
today on the RBI website relate to quarters ended June and September 2002. The data include the
range of actual and median lending rates for credit above Rs. two lakh as well as actual and
median lending rates for export credit in rupee terms. Both these categories of data are available
bank-group wise. An additional table presenting the lending rates of individual banks for credit
above Rs. two lakh and for export credit in rupee terms are also presented. The data will be
updated every quarter.
It may be recalled that the Reserve Bank of India had, while announcing the Monetary and
Credit Policy for 2002-2003 in April 2002, indicated its intention of collecting and publishing
maximum and minimum interest rates on advances charged by the banks. This was intended to
enhance transparency with regard to banks' lending rate.
