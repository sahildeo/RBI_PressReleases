RBI requires Gujarat ROC to wind up four Urban Banks
July 9, 2003
The Reserve Bank of India has issued requisitions to the Registrar of Cooperative
Societies, (ROCs), Gujarat to wind up the following banks :
(1) The General Cooperative Bank Ltd., Ahmedabad
(2) The Janata Commercial Cooperative Bank Ltd., Dholka
(3) Santram Cooperative Bank Ltd., Nadiad
(4) The Bhavnagar Welfare Cooperative Bank Ltd., Bhavnagar
The requisitions have been made in terms of Section 115A(2) of the Gujarat
Cooperative Societies Act, 1961, read with Section 13D of the Deposit Insurance and Credit
Guarantee Corporation Act, 1961, as the banks have failed to comply with the requirements
of the provisions of Sections 11(1), 22(3)(a) and 22(3)(b) of the Banking Regulation Act,
1949 (As applicable to Cooperative Societies) and the banks are unable to pay their debts.
As such, it will not be in order for these banks, among other things, to accept deposits
from the public and allow withdrawals by cheque, draft, order or otherwise. The Registrar of
Cooperative Societies, Gujarat has since appointed liquidators for these banks.
