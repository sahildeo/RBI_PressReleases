Auction of 91 day Treasury Bills-Enhancement of the Notified Amount
August 4, 2003
In view of the prevailing liquidity conditions, it has been decided to enhance the notified
amount in the auctions of 91 day Treasury Bills from the present Rs.500 crore to Rs.1,500 crore
for eight auctions starting from August 6, 2003 to September 24, 2003. The position will be
reviewed thereafter.
The notified amount of 364 day Treasury Bills will remain unchanged.
The format for auction of 91 day Treasury Bills and 364 day Treasury Bills will continue
to be multiple price auction format.
Accordingly, the revised Calendar for Auction of Government of India Treasury Bills
from August 6, 2003 to September 24, 2003 is as under:
Type of Periodicity Notified Amount Day of Auction Day of
T-Bills (Rs.Crore) Payment
91-Day Weekly 1,500 Every Following
Wednesday Friday
364-Day Fortnightly 1000 Wednesday Reporting
Preceding the Friday

The Reserve Bank of India retains the right to vary the amount and timing, if emerging
circumstances warrant, without assigning any reason. The calendar is thus subject to change, if
circumstances so warrant, including for reasons such as intervening holidays. Such changes, if
any, will be communicated through regular press releases.
The auction of treasury bills will be subject to the terms and conditions specified in the
General Notification No.F 2(12)-W&M/97 dated  March 31, 1998 issued by Government of
India.
