December 23, 2003
The Reserve Bank of India has today decided that residents will be able to make
remittances for miscellaneous purposes upto USD 5000 without any documentation formalities
including submission of Form A2.
In a circular issued to authorised dealers in foreign exchange today, the Reserve Bank
said that with a view to further liberalising the availability of foreign exchange to residents
without documentation formalities, it has revised the limit for this purpose from USD 500 to
USD 5000 with immediate effect. It is clarified that authorised dealers need not obtain any
documents from residents except a simple letter stating the basic information about the applicant
viz., his name and address, name and address of the beneficiary, amount to be remitted and the
purpose of remittance as long as exchange is being purchased for a permissible current account
transaction and the amount does not exceed USD 5000 or its equivalent and the payment is made
by a cheque drawn on the applicant's bank account or by a demand draft.
