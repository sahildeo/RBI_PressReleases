Revision in minimum rate of interest for RNBCs
March 31, 2003
The Reserve Bank of India today announced a revision in the minimum rate of interest which the
Residuary Non-Banking Companies (RNBCs) are required to offer on their deposits. Taking into
account the market conditions and changes in other interest rates in the entire financial system,
the minimum rate of return that RNBCs are obliged to pay on their deposits effective from April
1, 2003 has been revised to 3.5 per cent from the current 4 per cent on daily deposits and to 5 per
cent from the current 6 per cent on other deposits.
The new rates will be applicable only to fresh deposits and renewal of existing deposits on and
from April 1, 2003 by the RNBCs. Other stipulations of the Reserve Bank's directions on
RNBCs remain unchanged.
