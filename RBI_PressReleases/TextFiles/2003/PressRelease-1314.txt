March 12, 2003
The Reserve Bank of India has stated that the clearing house in Mumbai will not
function on March 14, 2003 as the Government of Maharashtra has declared it as a holiday

for Moharrum was declared on March 15, 2003. Now, the clearing house will function
normally on March 15, 2003
The clearing house in Reserve Bank of India in Mumbai will also remain closed on
May 14, 2003 instead of May 15, 2003 as the Government of Maharashtra has shifted the
