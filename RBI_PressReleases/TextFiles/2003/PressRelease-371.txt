Developments relating to Balance of Payments during April-June 2003
September 30, 2003
The actual Balance of Payments (BoP) statistics have been compiled for the first quarter of the
current fiscal year (i.e. April-June 2003). The BoP data for 2002-03 have been revised taking
into account latest data on merchandise exports and imports, software exports, external
assistance, external commercial borrowings and NRI deposits.
April-June 2003
Salient Features
The salient features of the developments in BoP during April-June 2003 are set out below:
Current Account
• During April-June 2003, on payments basis, merchandise exports amounted to US $
13.5 billion as against US $ 12.1 billion in the corresponding period of the previous
year thus, registering a growth of 12.2 per cent. Imports during the same period
stood at US $ 19.4 billion as compared with US $ 14.8 billion during April-June
2002. At this level, imports showed a growth of 30.8 per cent.
• The trade deficit on payments basis increased to US $ 5.9 billion in the quarter
under review as compared with US $ 2.8 billion during April-June 2002, mainly on
account of higher imports.
• Private transfers (net), comprising mainly remittances and local withdrawal from
NRI deposits, were higher at US $ 4.2 billion than US $ 3.5 billion in April-June
2002.
• Net position of the invisibles account registered a surplus of US $ 4.7 billion as
against a surplus of US $ 3.2 billion during April-June 2002.
• The current account during April-June 2003, with a trade deficit of US $ 5.9 billion
and a net invisible surplus of US $ 4.7 billion, registered a deficit of US $ 1.2
billion. This shift in the current account position was witnessed after maintaining
surplus position for six consecutive quarters since the third quarter of fiscal 2001-
02. During this period, quarterly current account surplus ranged between US $ 0.4
billion and US $ 1.9 billion.
Capital Account
• Net inflows under foreign investment comprising foreign direct investment (FDI)
and portfolio investment amounted to US $ 2.8 billion during April-June 2003 as
against US $ 1.1 billion during the corresponding period of the previous year. This
was mainly on account of higher inflows under portfolio investment.
• FDI inflows to India (net) under the extended coverage (including equity capital,
reinvested earnings and other capital of FDI companies) at US $ 0.7 billion were
lower than that of US $ 1.3 billion in April-June 2002. This was mainly on account2
of deceleration in inflow through SIA/FIPB route on the projects approved by
Government.
• Inflows under portfolio investment (both equity and debt) to India amounted to US
$ 2.0 billion as compared with a net outflow of US $ 0.3 billion in April-June 2002
in view of the expectation of good performance of the Indian economy.
• Net inflows under external loans (comprising external assistance, external
commercial borrowings and short-term loans) stood at US $ 1.2 billion as against an
outflow of US $ 0.5 billion in the corresponding period of the previous year.
• Net inflows under banking capital comprising foreign assets and liabilities
(including NRI deposits) of commercial banks and balances of foreign central
banks and international institutions stood at US $ 1.9 billion as compared with US $
0.7 billion in April-June 2002.
• The net position of the foreign assets and liabilities excluding NRI deposits, showed
a net inflow of US $ 0.1 billion as against an outflow of US $ 0.2 billion in the
corresponding period of the previous year.
• Other capital (net) comprising difference between the banking channel and customs
data relating to exports, fund held abroad raised through External Commercial
Borrowing (ECB), India’s subscription to international institutions and quota
payments to IMF amounted to US 0.5 billion as against US $ 0.9 billion in the same
period of 2002-03. The major portion under other capital was accounted by the
difference between banking channel and customs data relating to exports (US $ 0.8
billion), which was partially offset by decline in funds held abroad (US $ -0.4
billion).
Overall Balance
• Overall balance comprising current account deficit (US $ 1.2 billion), capital
account surplus (US $ 6.1 billion) and errors and omissions (US $ 0.3 billion)
showed a higher net inflow of US $ 5.2 billion than an inflow of US $ 1.7 billion in
April-June 2002.
• The net accretion to foreign exchange reserves excluding valuation change
amounted to US $ 5.2 billion as compared with US $ 1.7 billion during April-June
2002. Including valuation change (US $ 1.5 billion) net accretion to foreign
exchange reserves stood at US $ 6.7 billion.
Revised data for April-March 2002-03
The data for the fiscal year 2002-03 have been revised primarily due to revision in the
quarterly data for January-March 2003. This revision was necessitated as final figures were
received with respect to exports and imports, private transfers and investment income on the
current account and NRI deposits and ECB in the capital account.
