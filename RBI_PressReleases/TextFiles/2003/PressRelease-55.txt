RBI's General Permission for SEBI registered FIIs
December 17, 2003
Currently, on the basis of a 'no objection' from Securities and Exchange Board of India
(SEBI), a Foreign Institutional Investor (FII) has to approach the Reserve Bank of India for
opening a bank account (either in foreign currency and/or in rupees) to enable it to invest in
the Indian capital market. SEBI registers it as an FII thereafter.
In order to simplify the procedure for registration of the FIIs, it has been decided to do away
with the requirement of obtaining clearance from the Reserve Bank and SEBI separately.
Authorised dealers have now been allowed, through general permission, to open a bank
account (either in foreign currency and/or in rupees) for an FII that has already been
registered with SEBI.
