RBI Working Paper Series 12 / 2012 
RBI Working Paper suggests Alternative Capital Buffer Guidance for India 
 The Reserve Bank of India today placed on its website a Working Paper titled 
“Countercyclical Capital Buffer Guidance for India”. The Working Paper has been 
written by Shri Tulasi Gopinath and Shri A.K.Choudhary.  
In the Working Paper published by the Reserve Bank of India it has been 
argued that the guidance given by Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) 
is not appropriate for India. The finding is based on the analysis of annual banking 
data for the last 60 years since 1950-51. The authors have also showcased an 
alternative capital buffer guidance reflecting, among other things, the current status 
of economic development and the underlying banking business model in India. Using 
the annual data since 1990-91, the authors have empirically verified the performance 
of the alternative buffer guidance vis-à-vis the BCBS guidance. The salient findings 
of the research are: 
• The BCBS capital buffer guidance has a procyclicality bias. This finding is in 
agreement with the recent literature on the subject. On the other hand, the 
proposed alternative capital buffer guidance is countercyclical in nature.  
• The proposed alternative guidance is relatively more compatible with the 
asset market developments than the BCBS capital buffer guidance.  
     On the basis of the findings, while acknowledging the fact that all indicators 
potentially emit wrong signals, the authors propose a tool kit for the conduct of 
capital buffer operations in India. 
 Recent global financial crisis has brought to center-stage of policy concern, 
the imperative of strengthening regulation of banks, under the aegis of G-20. 
Accordingly, international standard setters, namely, Basel Committee on Banking 
Supervision (BCBS) and Financial Stability Board (FSB) have been formulating and 
publishing various guidelines. One such major initiative is Basel III framework aimed 
at augmenting resilience of the banking sector. Countercyclical capital buffer is a 
critical component of Basel III capital regulations. BCBS released its final guidance in 
2010, recommending among other things, a capital buffer guide for the consideration 
of the national regulatory authorities. The BCBS guidance involves the matric of 
credit-to-GDP ratio for conducting the buffer operations.
