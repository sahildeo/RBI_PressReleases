RBI releases Financial Stability Report : December 2012  
The sixth issue of the Financial Stability Report (FSR) of the Reserve Bank of 
India is being released in an environment of global macroeconomic instability and 
uncertainty. Economic growth in India has moderated in recent quarters, buffeted by 
global headwinds and domestic policy uncertainties. Growth, however, needs to 
accelerate if the momentum of poverty reduction, employment generation and pay off 
from the demographic dividend is to be accelerated. The Report reflects the collective 
assessment of the Sub Committee of the Financial Stability and Development 
Council (FSDC) on risks to financial stability.  
Highlights: 
(1)  Global risks remain elevated due to delays in resolution of issues like the 
European sovereign debt crisis and the imminent US fiscal cliff. 
(Para 1.2-1.6; Chapter: I ) 
(2)  Risks to domestic growth arise from structural impediments such as fall in 
domestic savings, persistently high inflation, regulatory and environmental 
issues. These have caused a fall in investment demand and moderation in 
consumption spending leading to decline in growth. 
(Para 1.17-1.21, Chapter 1)
(3) External sector imbalances remain a worry. Rising gold imports have 
worsened the current account deficit. Domestic savings have been falling. 
Moreover, a lower proportion of household savings is channelled towards 
financial products.  
(Para 1.25-1.27 and Box 1.1; Chapter 1) 
(4) Financial markets remained largely stable but exchange rate volatility was high 
relative to  that of some peers and advanced economies. Financial sector 
dominated the corporate bond issuance, reducing effective disintermediation. 
(Para 1.24 and 1.31 ; Chapter I) 
(5)  Corporate sector’s ability to service debt has been falling since 2009-10. Some 
industrial groups with greater exposure to key infrastructure sectors like power 
have witnessed high growth in leverage in recent years. 
(Para 1.36-1.39; Chapter I) 
(6) The Reserve Bank’s latest Systemic Risk Survey conducted in October 2012 
among bankers, consultants, academicians, etc. revealed concerns about the 
evolving global risks such as the fall in global growth and sovereign 
risk/contagion and a host of domestic factors like the increasing fiscal deficit, 
deterioration in growth outlook and bank asset quality. Respondents, however, 
remained confident about the stability of the domestic financial system. 
(Para 1.40-1.42 ; Chapter I)

(7)  Distress dependencies between banks have remained largely unchanged in 
the period under review.  
(Para 2.3-2.7, Chapter II) 
(8) While there has been no major shift in the pattern of interconnectedness or 
contagion risks in the system in the recent periods, an assessment of the 
impact of the liquidity contagion in the Indian banking system has been 
attempted for the first time in this issue of the FSR. 
(Para  2.19-2.23, Chapter II) 
(9)  Asset quality of the banking system came under stress during the period under 
review with greater recourse to restructuring.  Banking sector, however, 
remained resilient to credit, market and liquidity risks and capable of 
withstanding macroeconomic shocks, given their comfortable capital positions. 
(Para 2.32-2.37 and 2.40-2.49; Chapter II) 
(10)  Regulatory reforms initiated in the wake of the global financial crisis are in 
various stages of implementation across countries. Some reforms may have 
unintended consequences for emerging markets.  
(Para 3.1-3.4; Chapter III) 
(11)  The recent deterioration in asset quality and regulatory changes requiring 
higher provisions may pose challenges for banks in India as they migrate to 
Basel III.  
(Para 3.6; Chapter III) 
(12) Potential risks posed by procyclicality of margin movements at central 
counterparties (CCPs) in various market segments will need to be monitored. 
There are challenges in migrating all OTC derivative transactions to central 
clearing given problems in standardisation, insufficient liquidity and opacity in 
pricing information of some products/markets. 
(Para 3.37-3.40; Chapter III) 
(13)  Financial Inclusion, Financial Literacy and Consumer Protection have been 
recognised as intertwining threads in pursuit of financial stability. This edition 
of the FSR, for the first time, discusses the various regulatory initiatives to 
achieve this objective.   
(Para 3.62-3.77; Chapter III)
