Minutes of the October 23, 2012 Meeting of the
Technical Advisory Committee on Monetary Policy
The thirtieth meeting of the Technical Advisory Committee on Monetary Policy
(TAC) was held on October 23, 2012 in the run-up to the Second Quarter Review of
Monetary Policy 2012-13 on October 30, 2012. The main points of discussion in the
meeting are set out below.
1. Three Members were of the view that the global macroeconomic outlook is
gloomy. They saw evidence of clear slowdown in the global economy with the
European Union in recession, Japan slowing down, and sluggish growth in the
US with the danger of fiscal cliff persisting. Members noted that the IMF has
revised its growth projections downward. Two other Members were more
sanguine about the global situation. They expected a turnaround to take place
in the US as retail sales have increased, housing starts have picked up and
treasury yields have fallen. There are chances of growth in Japan two quarters
from now, According to these members, in China, the slowdown is expected to
have bottomed out and there is likelihood of a turnaround in Europe as well.
Notwithstanding the inflationary concerns in China and Singapore, the
Members generally felt that despite significant loosening of monetary policy at
the global level, global inflation is low, and there is evidence of softening of
commodity prices.
2. On the domestic front, Members were of the view that we are passing through
a very challenging time. Aggregate demand is weakening, and credit and
money supply growth are below the Reserve Bank’s projections. Industrial
growth has been more or less stagnant for nearly three quarters, capacity
utilization is low, capital goods production has fallen significantly, investment
intentions show no signs of revival and the economy seems to be operating
significantly below potential. The weak corporate sector was adversely
affecting the health of commercial banks in terms of growing non-performing
assets. Overall, there is significant slowdown in the Indian economy.
3. Some Members felt that though inflation is sticky, there does not seem to be
any evidence of excess demand conditions in any part of the economy. They
were of the view that given the global conditions, commodity prices might not
harden further and some softening of food inflation could also be expected
because of late revival of the south-west monsoon. These Members felt that
inflation might soften next year. On the other hand, some Members felt that
inflationary expectations are high. There are demand side pressures since not
only are wages increasing, but also the increase in managerial salaries and
salaries of the organised sector is very sharp. They suspected that wage
inflation might go up further and this is the last chance for the Reserve Bank to
anchor inflation expectations.

4. On the fiscal front, Members welcomed the moves by the government: some
improvement in the projected fiscal deficit; renewed attention to better
implementation of infrastructure projects; and further liberalisation of foreign
investment. However, the effectiveness of these measures remains to be seen
and will be dependent on the continued determination of the Government to
persevere with essential measures. At the present juncture, the tax collections
are low, subsidy bill is elevated and despite some relief due on spectrum
auctions, the likelihood of a fiscal slippage is high. Thus fiscal pressures will
continue to contribute to fragility of the economy, Members felt.
5. Members were of the opinion that the external sector continued to remain
vulnerable to adverse shocks. Although there is some improvement, the
current account deficit (CAD) remains well above comfort levels. Whereas
there has been some recovery in capital flows, these flows must be seen as
uncertain, given the fragile state of the world economy. The persistently high
CAD might be driven by specific relative prices rather than aggregate demand.
Some members felt there is room for the real exchange rate to depreciate and
every opportunity should be taken to build up forex reserves, which are now
below what they were three years ago. Another Member was of the view that
imports are not responsive to exchange rate changes and there is little reason
to expect much export buoyancy even with more depreciation. As such, the
Reserve Bank should leave the exchange rate to be determined by the market
as at present, and not intervene to depreciate it further.
6. On monetary policy and liquidity measures, five of the six external Members
suggested that the Reserve Bank should reduce the policy rate. They felt that
even though inflation is sticky, there are no demand pressures and there is a
need to revive investments. One member felt that higher growth would help in
reducing the fiscal deficit. Of these five Members, three recommended a
reduction in repo rate by 25 basis points, while the other two suggested a
sharper reduction of 50 basis points. Among the Members who recommended
a repo rate cut by 25 basis points, one Member also recommended a cut in
CRR by 25 basis points to help banks bring down lending rates without
reducing deposit rates. One of the six Members was of the view that the
decline in the growth rate was largely due to fiscal factors; since inflation
expectations are elevated, no change in the monetary policy stance is
necessary.
7. The meeting was chaired by Dr. D. Subbarao, Governor. Other internal
Members present were: Dr. Subir Gokarn, Vice-Chairman, Deputy Governors,
Dr. K.C. Chakrabarty and Shri Anand Sinha; and external Members, Shri Y.H.
Malegam, Prof. Indira Rajaraman, Prof. Sudipto Mundle, Prof. Errol D’Souza
and Prof. Ashima Goyal. Dr. Rakesh Mohan and Dr. Shankar Acharya could
not attend the meeting. Dr. Mohan submitted his written views. RBI officials,
Shri Deepak Mohanty, Dr. Michael D. Patra, Dr. B.K. Bhoi, Shri B.M. Misra
and Shri Pardeep Maria were in attendance.
8. Since February 2011, the Reserve Bank has been placing the main points of
discussions of the TAC on Monetary Policy meetings in the public domain with
a lag of roughly four weeks after the meeting.
