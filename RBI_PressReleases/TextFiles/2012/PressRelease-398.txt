Macroeconomic and Monetary Developments : 
Second Quarter Review 2012-13 
The Reserve Bank of India today released the Macroeconomic and Monetary 
Developments Second Quarter Review 2012-13. The document serves as a backdrop to 
the Second Quarter Review of Monetary Policy Statement 2012-13 to be announced on 
October 30, 2012. Highlights:   
Overall Outlook 
Growth-inflation balance warrants careful policy calibration as growth slows but 
inflation risks persist 
? As macro-risks from inflation and twin deficits recede further, that could yield 
space down the line for monetary policy to respond more effectively to growth 
concerns. 
? Speedy implementation of recent policy measures announced by the government 
and sustained reforms are important for turning the economy around.  
? Various surveys, including the Reserve Bank’s Industrial Outlook Survey suggests 
that business sentiments remain weak. Global growth projections, including that 
for India, are getting revised downwards.  
? The median projection for 2012-13 in the Reserve Bank’s Survey of Professional 
Forecasters has been lowered to 5.7 per cent from 6.5 per cent for growth, while 
that for average WPI inflation is revised upwards to 7.7 per cent from 7.3 per cent.  
Global Economic Conditions 
Global growth prospects weaken, contagion risks remain  
? Global growth prospects, both in advanced economies (AEs) and in emerging and 
developing economies (EDEs) have weakened. In October 2012, the International 
Monetary Fund lowered its growth projections for both these groups.  
? Euro area risks have affected business confidence and caused global trade to 
decelerate, thus impacting external demand. Downside risks to global growth 
stems from a possible US fiscal cliff leading to a sudden and sharp fiscal 
consolidation.  
? With slack in output and employment in AEs and falling growth in many large 
EDEs, global inflation pressures are likely to stay muted for the rest of 2012.  
? Risks of spillovers from global financial markets remain. Unconventional monetary 
policies have transitorily moderated uncertainties, but the underlying stress has 
not diminished with incomplete deleveraging and unfinished financial sector 
reforms.

Indian Economy 
Output 
Growth remains sluggish, reforms may arrest downturn 
? Economic indicators suggest that slowdown has continued in 2012-13. However, 
recent policy reforms should help in arresting the downturn. They may, on their 
successful implementation, support recovery later.  
? The potential growth rate of the Indian economy that peaked around the middle of 
2007-08, has since continued its downward slide into Q1 of 2012-13 to around 7.0 
per cent. With negative output gap persisting, growth in 2012-13 is likely to fall 
short of the Reserve Bank’s earlier projection.   
? Improved prospects for Rabi, following the late monsoon revival will partly offset 
the fall in Kharif output. Contraction in the mining sector continues following a 
clamp-down on illegal mining. Manufacturing output has stagnated due to weak 
investment and external demand. Leading indicators of services signals 
moderation. 
? The Reserve Banks’ Order Books, Inventory and Capacity Utilisation Survey show 
capacity utilisation was at its lowest in 13 quarters, though notably, the new order 
positions has improved. 
? Revival of the investment cycle hinges on resolution of policy uncertainties, 
particularly those facing the power and coal sectors. While substantive progress 
has been made towards new fuel supply agreements (FSAs), coal shortages are 
likely to persist.  
Aggregate Demand 
Fiscal consolidation and removal of impediments to infrastructure investments 
hold the key to growth revival 
? Aggregate demand is weakening, led by the investment slowdown. Investment 
intentions in the new projects sanctioned financial assistance remained low in Q1 
of 2012-13.  
? Sales of private, non-financial firms moderated further in Q1 of 2012-13, while 
operating profits of these firms declined. Early results for Q2 of 2012-13 indicate 
some improvement in operating profits, though sales continued to decelerate. 
? Fiscal slippage is likely in 2012-13 despite recent measures by the government. 
Food, fertiliser and petroleum subsidies remain high and are likely to overshoot 
Centre’s budget estimates. 
? Financial restructuring of state distribution companies (discoms) may not have 
immediate implications for state finances, but will have medium to long-term 
impact. 
External Sector 
CAD wider than comfortable in spite of BOP improvement 
? External sector risks remain in spite of the improved balance of payments (BOP) 
during Q1 of 2012-13. Though the merchandise trade deficit in 2012-13 so far has 
been lower than in the previous year, it largely reflects contraction in imports on 
the back of slower growth.  
? Global growth uncertainties continue to impinge on India’s export growth. Weak 
external demand has affected exports of engineering goods, gems and jewellery, 
textiles and petroleum products.  
? Services trade surplus is also lower, leaving the current account deficit (CAD) 
wide enough for a possible re-emergence of financing pressures should global 
risk aversion increase or domestic recovery falters. Recent measures, including 
those to augment FDI, should help reduce these risks. 3 
 
? External debt increased only marginally in Q1 of 2012-13, due to valuation gains. 
Vulnerability indicators deteriorated during the quarter, but have remained 
comparable with peer countries.  
Monetary and Liquidity Conditions 
Reserve Bank infuses liquidity, calibrates monetary policy to the evolving growth-
inflation dynamics 
? Active liquidity management through reductions in the cash reserve ratio (CRR) 
and statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) backed by open market operations (OMOs) has 
kept liquidity largely in line with policy objective, balancing inflation concerns and 
the need to ensure credit supply to support growth.  
? Monetary and credit aggregates remain below their indicative trajectory. The 
current credit slowdown largely indicates tepid demand conditions and 
distinctively lower credit expansion by public sector and foreign banks partly 
reflecting their risk aversion. 
? The ratios of gross and net non-performing assets of the public sector banks 
increased further during Q1 of 2012-13. Deteriorating asset quality may have 
affected their credit expansion. 
Financial Markets 
Markets respond to reform measures 
? Policy reforms measures have improved market sentiments, strengthening the 
equity prices and rupee exchange rate. However, there is need for steps to revive 
the sluggish primary capital market, so that financing constraints for corporate 
investments are reduced.   
? G-sec yields were range bound, though with a softer bias, reflecting improved 
liquidity conditions. Gains for the bond markets have been limited due to concerns 
about the likely fiscal slippage during the year.   
? The Reserve Bank’s House Price Index (HPI) show that house prices increased 
further during Q1 of 2012-13 in almost all cities. Transaction also picked up in 
most cities after a fall in the preceding quarter. 
Price Situation 
Inflation remains on a sticky path, warranting caution  
? Inflation has stayed sticky around 7.5 per cent. Persistent non-food manufactured 
product inflation, despite the growth slowdown has emerged as a concern.  
? Consumer price inflation continues to be above the inflation in wholesale price 
index. This divergence is observed even for ex-food and fuel components of the 
two indices. 
? Wage pressures remain persistent, though the year-on-year increase in rural 
wages moderated from 22 per cent in August 2011 to 18 per cent in August 2012. 
In organised sector, growth in staff costs was about 17 per cent in 2011-12 and 
maintained about the same pace in Q1 of 2012-13.  
? While the near-term inflation risks are on the upside, inflation is expected to 
moderate from Q4 of 2012-13. However, improved supply responses and 
moderation of wage inflation is vital for bringing down inflation to comfort level.
