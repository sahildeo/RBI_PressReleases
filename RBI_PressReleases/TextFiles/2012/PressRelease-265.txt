RBI - ADB Conference on Managing Capital Flows:  
Management of capital flows a concern for both source as well as  
recipient countries; Merit in acting in coordinated manner in the  
event of excess capital flow volatility to maximise welfare 
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) co-
hosted an international conference on “Managing Capital Flows” in Mumbai during 
November 19-20, 2012. Central bankers, international institutions, academics and 
analysts from Asia, Europe, Latin America and the US participated in the conference 
and deliberated on key issues relating to ‘Managing Capital Flows’. Views broadly 
converged around the opinion that management of capital flows should be a concern 
for both source as well as recipient countries, and to maximise welfare there is merit 
in acting in concert and in a coordinated manner in the event of excess capital flow 
volatility.  
Shri Deepak Mohanty, Executive Director, Reserve Bank of India welcomed 
the participants and underscored the relevance of the topic particularly in the present 
context of uncertain global economic and financial conditions. He drew an interesting 
anecdotal parallel between Mundell’s impossible trinity and the Hindu belief of 
impossible co-existence of deities of Brahama, Vishnu and Mahesh under the same 
roof and indicated that these conflicts are better managed in the country specific 
situation.  
Mr. Iwan Azis, ADB in his opening remarks underscored the importance of 
capital account management and the need to learn from country experiences in this 
regard. He noted that Asia had gone through a dramatic turn-around from excess 
investment during pre-1997 to excess savings during post-1997 even though the 
region has huge deficit in social and physical infrastructure.   
Dr. Subir Gokarn, Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India in his keynote 
address set the tone for the conference. He underscored the importance of 
multilateral coordination, complementarity between capital controls and 
macroeconomic policy options and need to distinguish strategic and tactical controls 
for managing capital flows. 
The conference deliberated on the subject in three technical sessions:           
(i) compositional shift and volatility of capital flows, (ii) challenges of capital account 
management, and (iii) select country experiences – objectives of capital flows 
management, instruments and their effectiveness. This was followed by two panel 
discussions comprising senior officials of central banks. The discussions revolved 
around: (i) capital controls and instruments of capital flow management, and (ii) 
adequacy of reserves, volatility in capital flows and international financial 
architecture. In the summing up, Mr. Bruno Carrasco captured the essence of the 
proceedings of the conference.

Apart from Dr. Subir Gokarn, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of India 
and Mr. Iwan Azis, Head, Office of Regional Economic Integration, Asian 
Development Bank, several eminent central bankers, academicians, policy makers, 
financial regulators and supervisors participated in the conference to share their 
experience and thoughts. Some of the eminent participants included Deputy 
Governors/Deputy Head/Senior officials of central banks/monetary authorities of 
Brazil (Mr. Luiz Awazu Pereira), Chile (Mr. Manuel Marfan), India (Shri H.R. Khan) 
Indonesia (Mr. Hartadi A Sarwono), Korea (Mr. Sangdai Ryoo), Maldives              
(Mr. Aishath Zahira), Philippines (Ms Wilhelmina Manalac), Singapore (Mr. Choy K. 
Meng), Switzerland (Mr. Thomas Moser), Sri Lanka (BDWA Silva); Professors such 
as Kristin Forbes, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Joseph E Gagnon, 
Peterson Institute for International Economics, Michael Klein, Fletcher School, Tufts 
University; and Mr. Jonathan Ostry, International Monetary Fund, Mr. Hun Kim, ADB, 
Mr. Ashok Lahiri, Executive Director for India, ADB. Apart from these, 
representatives of major commercial banks, financial and research institutions from 
India also participated. Professor Shankar N. Acharya, Indian Council for Research 
on International Economic Relations (ICRIER) moderated the panel discussions. 
Major takeaways from the conference were:  
? With more open capital account and financial innovations, growth of hedge 
funds and mushrooming of new breed of financial institutions and investors, 
cross-border capital flows have become highly volatile particularly after the 
2008 crisis.  
? Capital flows are seldom consistent with the precise needs of the individual 
economies and therefore have implications for exchange rate management, 
domestic monetary and liquidity conditions and overall macroeconomic and 
financial stability.  
? Capital flows are driven by both pull (economic fundamentals of recipients) 
and push (policy stance of source countries) factors. Monetary and prudential 
regulation policies in source countries may exacerbate the level and riskiness 
of capital flows in recipient countries. Thus, adjustment in the wake of volatile 
capital flows should not be the exclusive responsibility of receiving country. 
Both recipient and source economies need to act in coordination and the 
burden of adjustment should be shared between them.  
? Free flow of capital may not always ensure efficient global outcome as 
individuals fail to recognise the domestic economy’s collateral constraint. 
Thus, the importance of capital controls as legitimate tool for protecting the 
domestic financial markets under certain circumstances is well recognised. 
However, use of capital controls to keep the currency undervalued to gain 
competitive advantage need to be avoided. 
? It is important that controls should not be perceived as a substitute to prudent 
macroeconomic policies and well regulated financial system. A sound and well 
developed financial system makes absorption and intermediation of foreign 
flows smoother for Emerging Market Economies. Macro-prudential 
instruments supplemented to monetary policy may help in achieving control 
over inflation and ensure financial stability in the wake of excess global 
liquidity.

? Capital account management needs to be viewed in terms of a distinction 
between "strategic" and "tactical" controls. Strategic controls spell out the 
pecking order and accompanying controls and assure the stake holders that 
no further restrictions will be imposed. Tactical controls, on the contrary, are 
essentially emergency responses to intense pressure and will largely depend 
on the country circumstances and appetite for risk. 
? Within the ambit of prevailing international financial architecture, reserves are 
first line of defense against the backdrop of volatile capital flows. This is 
particularly true for current account deficit economies. While assessing 
adequacy of reserves, a distinction needs to be made between surplus and 
deficit economies. Deficit economies are far more vulnerable and need to 
build sufficiently large reserves to maintain confidence of the investors. 
?  There is a need to discourage excessive reliance on only few reserve 
currencies as the main reserve asset. Development of SDR bond market may 
reduce the need to borrow in foreign currencies thereby decreasing the 
currency mismatches and exposure to developments in the US and euro-area 
economies. Development of local currency bond market can also help in this 
direction. 
? The country experiences presented in the conference showed that countries 
have generally tried to balance the benefits and costs associated with capital 
flows using a mix of capital controls (CFMs) and macro-prudential measures. 
These inter alia include: flexibility in exchange rate, sterilised foreign 
exchange intervention and careful articulation of macroeconomic policies. 
Apart from managing volatility in exchange rate and the systemic liquidity, 
these measures are generally intended to direct the flows towards long-term 
investments, equity instruments, and growth promoting sectors.  Apart from 
various capital controls used across countries, Brazil, in particular, also used 
tax on certain categories of capital inflows to deal with their implications for 
economy. 
? Finally, an important message that emerged from country experiences has 
been that in the face of volatile capital flows, flexibility and pragmatism are 
needed in exchange rate policy rather than adherence to strict theoretical 
rules. Central banks need to strike a fine balance between alternative and 
often conflicting objectives while ensuring that negative externalities of capital 
flows are minimized on the society at large.
