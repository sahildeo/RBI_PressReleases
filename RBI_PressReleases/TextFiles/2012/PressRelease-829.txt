Survey of Private Remittances to Indian Households with  
Non-Resident Accounts :  Release of Survey Data  
 
The Reserve Bank of India today released the data from the Survey of Private 
Remittances to India.   
The Reserve Bank had conducted a survey on Private Remittances to India 
for the reference years 2007-08 and 2008-09, in the selected districts of four states 
(viz., Maharashtra, Gujarat, Kerala and Punjab) with high concentration of inward 
foreign remittances, during December 2009 to July 2010. 
The objectives of the survey were to: 
(a) Analyse the economic profile of households receiving remittances 
(b) Identify the source country of remittances 
(c) Classify the modes of remittances, Geographical spread of remittances in 
India; and 
(d) Ascertain the utilisation pattern of remittances. 
 For the purpose of the survey, nine districts from the four states were selected 
using probability proportional to size (PPS) sampling technique and the households 
were selected randomly from both Rural and Urban areas based on the Non-
Resident (External) Rupee Account [NR(E)RA]  accounts maintained with 
Authorised Dealer (AD) bank branches. It was decided to conduct the survey in 
these four states with the target sample size in the range 4,000-5,000, with 2,000-
2,500 households each from Rural and Urban areas. Out of the around 7,000 
households identified for canvassing, 2,947 households responded. Information on 
private remittances to India was collected from the selected households in the 
attached survey schedule  as per the attached data description. 
. The highlights of the survey results are given below: 
• Of the 2,947 survey respondents, 53.5 per cent households were from urban 
areas whereas the remaining 46.5 per cent were from the rural areas. Kerala, 
Gujarat, Punjab and Maharashtra accounted for 46.4 per cent, 34.2 per cent, 
10.3 per cent and 9.1 per cent of the respondents, respectively. [Table 1: 
Basic Households information] 
• Average annual income and expenditure of the survey respondents during 
2008-09 stood at ` 5,95,814 and `362,953, respectively. Remittances 
received from abroad had the largest share (68 per cent) in their total income 
whereas the expenditure on the food items (40 per cent) had highest share in 
expenditure.[Table2:  Income and Expenditures of households]

• Around half of the respondents refused to give the details of their financial 
assets. For the remaining households, average assets and liabilities stood at    
` 49,48,436 and ` 82,285, respectively, at the time of survey. [Table 3: Assets 
and Liabilities of the Households] 
• 67 per cent of total migration was concentrated in the occupation of Software 
professional, Self-Employed professionals and Entrepreneur/Partnership. 
[Table 4: Information on the country wise migrant's occupation] 
• As per the survey respondents, around 70 per cent of the migrants had at 
least a high school degree.  [Table 5: Information on the country-wise 
migrant's education] 
• United States, United Kingdom and Dubai were the main destinations of 
migration and together constituted around half of total migration during the 
reference period. Kerala accounted for most of the migrations to the Gulf 
countries whereas migrations to America and European countries were from 
other states. [Table 6: District-wise and country-wise migrants] 
• Household consumption was reported as the major use of remittance (around 
40 percent) in both rural and urban areas. The share of funds used for 
education was small (3.6 per cent).  Since family members of NRI account 
holders were the survey respondents, investment in types of activities such as 
the purchase of land or a house by NRIs beyond the knowledge of 
respondents were not reported in the survey. [Table 7: Information on use of 
remittances] 
• Direct credit to Non-Resident account was reported as the major mode of 
remittance of money from abroad in all the nine centers ( 57.5 percent on an 
average of selected cities) and its share ranged from 38.2 per cent (Trissur) to 
96.7 per cent (Mumbai) in total remittances during the reference period.
