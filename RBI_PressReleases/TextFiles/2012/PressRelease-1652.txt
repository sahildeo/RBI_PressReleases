The valuation loss, reflecting the appreciation of the US dollar against major 
currencies, accounted for US$ 1.0 billion during April-December 2011 as compared 
with valuation gain of US$ 7.3 billion during the same period in the previous year. 
Accordingly, valuation loss accounted for 12.3 per cent of the total decline in foreign 
exchange reserves during April-December of 2011-12.
