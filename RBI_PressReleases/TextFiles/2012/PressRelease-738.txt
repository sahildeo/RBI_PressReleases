Inflation Expectations Survey of Households

The Reserve Bank of India has today launched 29 round of the Survey with July-
September 2012 as the current reference period. The Survey seeks qualitative 
responses from households on price changes (general prices as well as prices of 
specific product groups) in the next three months as well as in the next one year and 
quantitative responses on current, three-month ahead and one-year ahead inflation 
rates.  
 The Reserve Bank has been conducting Inflation Expectations Survey of 
Households (IESH) on a quarterly basis since September 2005. It uses the results of 
this Survey as an important input to the monetary policy formulation.   
Inflation expectations are subjective assessments of around 4,000 households 
across 12 cities proposed to be covered in the Survey round and are based on 
households’ individual consumption baskets. M/s Beaumont Consultancy Services, 
Mumbai has been engaged to conduct this round of the Survey on behalf of the 
Reserve Bank. The agency will approach the households for this purpose during the 
quarter. Selected households are requested to provide their response to the agency. In 
case of any query/clarification, households may  contact The Director, Division of
