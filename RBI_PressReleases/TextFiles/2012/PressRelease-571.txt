Developments in India's Balance of Payments during the First 
Quarter (April-June) of 2012-13 
Preliminary data on India’s balance of payments (BoP) for the first quarter 
(Q1), i.e., April-June 2012 of the financial year 2012-13, are now available. The 
details of these data, as per the revised format of BoP presentation provided in IMF's 
BPM6, are set out in Statement I. These data as per the old format are also given in 
Statement II. 
Highlights of BoP during April-June 2012  
During Q1 of 2012-13, a moderation in trade deficit due to sharper decline in 
imports as compared with exports coupled with improvements in secondary income,  
led to decline in current account deficit (CAD) in absolute terms as compared with 
Q1 of the previous year. However, as a proportion of GDP it rose to 3.9 per cent as 
compared with 3.8 per cent in Q1 of the previous year. It reflected the fall in the 
growth of GDP and rupee depreciation of about 17 per cent against US dollar over 
the corresponding quarter. 
• On a BoP basis, goods exports recorded a decline of 2.6 per cent while 
imports registered a sharper decline of 3.6 per cent during Q1 of 2012-13. 
• In absolute terms, the trade deficit on BoP basis amounted to US$ 42.5 
billion, which was lower than the corresponding quarter of the previous year 
(US$ 44.9 billion). However, as a percentage of GDP, trade deficit widened to 
10.0 per cent during the quarter as compared with 9.8 per cent in Q1 of 
previous year. 
• Net exports of services witnessed a decline of 13.0 per cent during Q1 of 
2012-13 over Q1 of 2011-12 mainly due to lower growth in receipts led by 
‘transportation’, ‘travel’, ‘construction’, ‘insurance & pension services’ and 
‘other business services’.  
• While net secondary income (private transfers) receipts remained buoyant at 
US$ 16.8 billion, primary income account (investment income) continued to 
show a net outflow. 
• Consequently, the CAD at US$ 16.4 billion was lower in Q1 of 2012-13 than 
the corresponding quarter of the previous year (US$ 17.4 billion). However, as 
a proportion to GDP, CAD stood at 3.9 per cent as compared with 3.8 per 
cent (revised) in the corresponding quarter of previous year. 
• Net inflows under capital and financial account witnessed a decline primarily 
on account of moderation in foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows and loans 
by banks and non-banks.

• There was a net accretion to foreign exchange reserves of US$ 0.5 billion 
during Q1 of 2012-13 (excluding valuation). 
Balance of Payments for April-June 2012 (Q1) of 2012-13 
The major items of the BoP for the first quarter (Q1) of 2012-13 are set out 
below in Table 1.  
Goods Trade 
• On a BoP basis, growth in merchandise exports (y-o-y), declined by 2.6 per 
cent during Q1 of 2012-13 as against a growth of 42.7 per cent in the same 
quarter of previous year. 
• Growth in merchandise imports on BoP basis declined by 3.6 per cent from 
41.8 per cent in Q1 of 2011-12 as imports of precious metal and POL declined 
and there has been moderation in the non-oil non-gold imports. The growth of 
non-oil non-gold segment of imports decelerated to 0.3 per cent as compared 
with a growth of 16.2 per cent a year ago. Gold & silver imports declined 
sharply by 47.5 per cent as against a growth of 123.1 per cent in the last year. 
Oil imports during this period marginally declined by 0.1 per cent owing to 
softening of oil prices, as against an increase of 52.5 per cent during the 
same period preceding year. 
• While decline in non-oil non-gold imports largely reflects slowdown in 
economic activity, sharp decline in import of precious metal also seems to 
have been caused by various policy measures to discourage such imports 
including increase in custom duty.

• As decline in import growth was sharper than that of export growth over the 
same quarter of previous year, the trade deficit declined to US$ 42.5 billion in 
Q1 of 2012-13 (10.0 per cent of GDP) as compared with US$ 44.9 billion (9.8 
per cent of GDP) in Q1 of 2011-12, showing a y-o-y growth of (-)5.4 per cent 
as against of 40.2 per cent over the same quarter a year ago.  
Services and Income Flows  
•  During the quarter, while growth in services receipts on y-o-y basis, moderated 
to 2.0 per cent (27.4 per cent in Q1 of 2011-12), services payments witnessed a 
higher growth of 15.9 per cent largely on account of surge in other business 
services. Consequently, net services exports during the quarter declined by 
13.0 per cent to US$ 14.2 billion (US$ 16.3 billion in Q1 of 2011-12) (Table 2).  
• Net outflow on account of primary income during the quarter was higher than 
that recorded during Q1 of 2011-12. Receipts on account of investment income 
including other primary income at US$ 1.4 billion recorded a decline of 24.6 per 
cent as compared to a decline of 27.5 per cent in the corresponding quarter 
mainly due to persistence of lower interest rate abroad. 
• On the other hand, investment income payments increased by 14.5 per cent as 
against a decline of 1.8 per cent during the same period a year ago driven by 
higher interest payments under ECBs, short term credits and NRI deposits as 
India has increasingly resorted to debt flows to finance its current account 
deficit.  
• Secondary income (on net basis), reflecting mainly the remittances from 
overseas Indians, at US$ 16.8 billion remained buoyant and recorded a growth 
of 13.8 per cent during Q1 over the corresponding quarter of 2011-12 (12.7 per 
cent in Q1 of 2011-12).  
• On account of lower trade deficit and higher secondary income, the CAD 
witnessed moderation and stood at US$ 16.4 billion in Q1 of 2012-13 as 
compared to US$ 21.7 billion during preceding quarter (Jan-Mar 2012) and US$ 
17.4 billion in Q1 of 2011-12.  
• Despite moderation in CAD in absolute terms,  CAD as a percentage of GDP 
stood higher at 3.9 per cent of GDP in Q1 of 2012-13 as compared with 3.8 per 
cent during the corresponding quarter of previous year mainly due to lower 
GDP level on account depreciation of rupee vis-à-vis US dollar. Exchange rate 
depreciation has accounted for about 0.7 percentage point increase in the CAD-
GDP ratio during the quarter.

Capital Account 
• Capital account which includes acquisition/disposals of non-produced non-
financial goods and other capital flows showed an outflow of US$ 0.2 billion on 
a net basis. 
Financial Account 
With a slowdown in the net FDI to India (inward FDI minus outward FDI), 
outflows under portfolio investment and decline in ‘loans to India’ by deposit taking 
corporations (Non-NRI Banking Capital) and by other sectors (ECBs), the net inflows 
under the financial account excluding change in reserves during April-June 2012 
recorded a significant decline over the same period of previous year (Table 3). Net 
financial inflows declined to US$ 17.0 billion during Q1 of 2012-13 (US$ 24.1 billion 
during Q1 in previous year).  
• FDI inflows to India during Q1 of 2012-13 at US$ 6.2 billion stood lower than the 
previous year’s level of US$ 12.4 billion. FDI flows by India also declined to 
US$ 2.0 billion from US$ 3.1 billion in the same period of preceding year. Thus 
net FDI inflows to India (inward FDI minus outward FDI) during April-June 2012 
stood at US$ 4.2 billion as compared to US$ 9.3 billion during the 
corresponding period of previous year. Portfolio investment during the quarter 
recorded an outflow of US$ 2.0 billion as against an inflow of US$ 2.3 billion. 
• Net loans availed by banks during Q1 of 2012-13 declined to US$ 3.0 billion 
from US$ 11.5 billion during the same period a year ago. Significant moderation 
in loans by banks was mainly on account of net repayment of overseas 
borrowings by banks and lower draw down of their foreign currency assets held 
abroad as compared with the previous year.  5 
 
• Net loans availed by non-Government and non-banking sectors (net ECBs) at 
US$ 0.8 billion also witnessed a moderation (US$ 3.0 billion in Q1 of 2011-12) 
as there was decline in disbursements and increase in the repayments of 
ECBs. However, net inflows under short-term trade credits witnessed a surge 
during the period and stood at US$ 5.4 billion as compared with US$ 3.1 billion 
during the same period of 2011-12.  
• Net inflows under ‘currency and deposits by banks’ (NRI deposits) stood higher 
at US$ 6.6 billion inter alia reflecting the deregulation of interest rates on rupee 
deposits and increase in ceiling of foreign currency deposits.  
• Despite moderation in CAD, net accretion to foreign exchange reserves at US$ 
0.5 billion during Q1 of 2012-13 was lower as compared with US$ 5.4 billion 
during the corresponding period of previous year mainly on account of sharp 
decline in net inflows under capital and financial account. In nominal terms (i.e., 
including valuation changes), foreign exchange reserves declined by US$ 4.7 
billion during the quarter reflecting appreciation of US dollar against major 
international currencies during the quarter.
