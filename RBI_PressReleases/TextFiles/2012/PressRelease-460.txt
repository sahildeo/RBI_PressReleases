Understand Philosophy of Legal Opinions:
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Dipak Misra advises In-house RBI Lawyers
“Courts do not normally interfere in economic policy framed by the Reserve Bank
of India. It was, therefore, necessary for law officers to understand the philosophy of
economy as also to exercise economy of philosophy in legal opinions, which should be
objective and legally sustainable.” This was in brief the message conveyed to Law
Officers of the Reserve Bank of India by Hon’ble Mr. Justice Dipak Misra who addressed
them over the weekend at the Seventh Legal Cells’ Conference held in Bhubaneswar.
In his speech, Hon'ble Mr. Justice Dipak Misra asserted that in-house lawyers
advising their employers should do proper research. He explained that research is not
merely compiling material from many sources. Research should be knowledge based
and should be done with intellectual mind and not with an intuitive mind. In-house
lawyers, while doing research, have to study the judgments of Courts in detail and in the
context in which the judgment was given and understand the rationale for the judgment.
The law officers of the Reserve Bank should be objective and independent while
assisting the policy makers with their legal advice, Hon'ble Mr. Justice Dipak Misra said.
Later, Hon’ble Mr. Justice M.M. Das chaired a panel discussion on banking and
depositor protection related issues. Executive Director, Shri S. Karuppasamy, Principal
Legal Adviser Shri G.S. Hegde, Legal Advisers Shri D.N. Tripathi and Ms. M. Anand
were the other members of the panel. The panel discussion included issues relating to
rights and liabilities of the nominal shareholders of cooperative societies and cooperative
banks, legal implications of publicising the names of defaulters, etc. Hon’ble Mr. Justice
Das also shared his experiences as a lawyer and as a Judge, particularly about the
frauds being committed on gullible public by financial companies and by certain
fraudsters on financial institutions. Shri Karuppasamy, as a member of the panel,
provided valuable inputs on issues of concern for the Reserve Bank in respect of
cooperative banks.
Shri S. Karuppasamy thanked Hon’ble Mr. Justice Dipak Misra for his thought
provoking speech and Hon’ble Mr. Justice M.M. Das for chairing the panel discussion.
Legal Adviser Shri D.N. Tripathi proposed a vote of thanks.
The Reserve Bank of India organised the Seventh Legal Cells’ Conference of its
Law Officers from October 12 to 14, 2012 in Bhubaneswar. Hon'ble Mr. Justice Dipak
Misra, Supreme Court of India was the chief guest and Hon’ble Mr. Justice M.M. Das of
Orissa High Court chaired one panel discussion. Principal Legal Adviser Shri G.S.
Hegde while welcoming and introducing the Hon’ble Judges referred to some of the
landmark decisions of the Hon’ble Judges in the field of protection of human rights,
corporate criminal liability, right to information, banking laws, etc.
