 The Reserve Bank of India today notified that the Induslnd Bank Ltd. has 
passed resolutions at the board of directors' Meeting and a resolution in its Annual 
General Meeting agreeing for the purchase of its equity shares by Foreign 
Institutional Investors (FIIs) up-to 49% of their paid-up capital through 
primary/secondary markets in India. The Reserve Bank of India further advise that its 
approval to the Induslnd Bank Ltd. for raising FII investment limit to 49% is subject to 
the condition that aggregate foreign investment in the bank should also not exceed 
the composite sectoral  cap of 74% as prescribed by the Government from time to 
time  it is also advised that the existing prior approval applications for purchase of 
shares received through custodian banks of FIIs pending with Reserve Bank of India 
which could not be processed due to unavailability of limit/headroom, such investors 
are free to invest within the enhanced ceiling.  
As the Induslnd Bank Ltd. has now passed the necessary resolutions in this 
regard equity shares of the Induslnd Bank Ltd. can now be purchased through 
primary market and stock exchanges provided:  
The purchase of equity shares by a single FII/SEBI approved sub-account of 
a registered FII in the Induslnd Bank Ltd. shall not exceed 10% (Ten percent) of the 
paid-up equity capital of the bank. It may be ensured that the investment made are 
within the stipulated ceilings.  
The Reserve Bank of India will henceforth be monitoring the FII investment 
under Portfolio Investment Scheme (PIS) at sectoral cap/statutory ceiling as 
applicable and not the intermediate ceiling fixed by the above indicated bank. It will 
be the bank's responsibility to ensure that the applicable cap is not breached. The 
permission is being issued from FEMA angle only.  
It may be noted that the present policy of Department of Banking Operations 
and Development (DBOD) requires RBI acknowledgement for acquisition / transfer 
of shares of 5% and more of a private sector bank by FIIs.
