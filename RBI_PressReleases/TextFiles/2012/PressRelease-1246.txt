RBI releases its Monthly Bulletin for June 2012 
The Reserve Bank of India released the June 2012 issue of its monthly 
Bulletin today. The June 2012 issue carries four special articles: (i) India’s Foreign 
Trade: 2011-12 (ii) Finances of State Governments - 2011-12: Highlights (iii) Report 
of the Working Group on Savings during the Twelfth Five-Year Plan (2012-13 to 
2016-17) (iv) Finances of Non-Government Non-Financial Public Limited 
Companies: 2010. Highlights of the special articles are: 
1. India’s Foreign Trade: 2011-12 
This article reviews India’s merchandise trade performance during 2011-12 on 
the basis of data released by the Directorate General of Commercial Intelligence and 
Statistics (DGCI&S). It also analyses disaggregated commodity-wise and direction-
wise details for the period 2011-12 (April-December). 
Main Findings 
• During 2011-12, exports stood at US$ 303.7 billion and recorded a growth of 
20.9 per cent as compared with an increase of 40.5 per cent during the 
previous year. While the exports performed well during the first half of 2011-
12, there was significant deceleration in the second half as global trading 
conditions deteriorated mainly reflecting weakening of world demand inter alia 
caused by euro zone crisis.  
• During 2011-12, imports at US$ 488.6 billion registered a growth of 32.1 per 
cent as compared with 28.2 per cent in the preceding year. There has been a 
significant rise in import of petroleum, oil and lubricants (POL), gold and silver 
and machinery. 
• Petroleum, oil and lubricants (POL) imports at US$ 155.6 billion in 2011-12 
showed a higher growth of 46.9 per cent, largely reflecting increase in 
international crude oil prices, as compared with 21.6 per cent a year ago. The 
average price of Indian basket of crude oil during 2011-12 stood at US$ 111.6 
per barrel, which was 31.1 per cent higher than US$ 85.1 per barrel during 
2010-11.  
• Gold and silver import at US$ 61.5 billion recorded a growth of 44.4 per cent 
during 2011-12 as compared with 43.5 per cent in 2010-11. 
• Non-oil non-gold & silver imports during 2011-12 at US$ 271.5 billion 
recorded a growth of 22.7 per cent as compared with 29.0 per cent in the 
preceding year. Trade deficit during 2011-12 amounted to US$ 184.9 billion, 
as compared with US$ 118.7 billion during 2010-11.  
• Trade deficit during 2011-12 amounted to US$ 184.9 billion, as compared with 
US$ 118.7 billion during 2010-11.

• The disaggregated data on commodity-wise merchandise exports indicate 
that during 2011-12 (April-December), engineering goods, petroleum 
products, chemicals, textiles, gems & jewellery and agricultural products 
contributed more than 88 per cent of India’s exports.  
• While the share of exports to countries of European Union in India’s total 
merchandise exports declined marginally, the same of OPEC countries 
declined by around two percentage point during April-December 2011 over 
April-December 2010. 
2.  Finances of State Governments - 2011-12: Highlights  
The article presents highlights of finances of State governments based on 
‘State Finances: A Study of Budgets of 2011-12’ released on March 31, 2012. 
Main Findings 
• The State government budgets for 2011-12 proposed to carry forward the 
fiscal correction process by focusing more on expenditure control against the 
backdrop of roll back of fiscal stimulus measures and tapering off of the 
impact of the Sixth Pay Commission award. All States, barring one, amended 
their Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Acts/Rules, in 
line with the Thirteenth Finance Commission (ThFC) recommendation, with 
the aim of eliminating revenue deficits and bringing about graduated 
reductions in fiscal deficit and debt levels latest by 2014-15. 
• The consolidated revenue account is budgeted to switch from deficit to 
surplus during 2011-12 after a gap of two years, driven primarily by a 
compression in revenue expenditure.  
• The improvement in the revenue account is expected to not only provide the 
necessary resources for increased capital outlay but also enable a reduction 
in the GFD-GDP ratio by 0.5 percentage point in 2011-12(BE) over 2010-
11(RE). The envisaged fiscal deficit-GSDP ratio for 2011-12 is, however, 
higher than the ThFC’s annual path, mainly on account of higher capital 
outlay. 
• The consolidated debt-GDP ratio of the States declined in 2011-12 (BE) to 
22.5 per cent from 25.5 per cent in 2009-10 which is below the ThFC 
recommended limit of 26.1 per cent for the year. This trend is poised to 
continue in the medium term with the amended FRBMs of the States setting 
out a graduated path of reduction in debt-GSDP ratios for the respective 
States. 
• As the States embark upon the second phase of a rule-based fiscal 
consolidation path, care needs to be taken to address the structural rigidities 
in State finances, improve disclosures for remaining alert on qualitative 
aspects of fiscal correction, move towards the proposed restructured public 
expenditure system for better management of outlays for effective outcomes, 
rationalise centrally sponsored schemes for improving their effectiveness and 
address issues relating to financial losses of the State Power Utilities. 
• An analysis of the Role of the Reserve Bank in State Finances traces the 
responsibilities of the Reserve Bank which have, over the years, increased 
beyond its mandated roles of serving as a banker and debt manager of the 
State governments. As a banker to the States, the Reserve Bank extends 
banking services to all the States, except Sikkim. It also modulates ways and 
means (WMA) limits and overdraft (OD) regulations to meet the short-term 
resource requirements of the States consistent with its objective of 3 
 
maintaining monetary stability. As a debt manager, the Reserve Bank created 
the enabling conditions for the States to transit to a full-fledged auction 
system for market borrowings. Apart from these traditional roles, the Reserve 
Bank has also been playing an advisory role and has been instrumental in 
initiating rule-based medium-term fiscal consolidation of the States, besides 
advising them on policy issues emerging from time to time to ensure fiscal 
sustainability.  
3.  Report of the Working Group on Savings during the Twelfth Five-Year Plan 
The Planning Commission constituted a Working Group on Savings during the 
Twelfth Five-Year Plan (Chairman: Dr. Subir Gokarn, Deputy Governor, RBI) in 
March 2011, to estimate the various components of domestic and foreign savings as 
also the resources available for private investment including infrastructure and the 
likely flows for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) and Agriculture. The 
Working Group submitted its Report on April 24, 2012. 
(http://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/PublicationReport/Pdfs/03AFS080612.pdf)  
Main Findings 
• The Working Group made savings projections under three scenarios viz., real 
GDP growth of 8.5 per cent and inflation of 5.0 per cent (Scenario I); real GDP 
growth of 9.0 per cent and inflation of 5.0 per cent (Scenario II); and real GDP 
growth of 8.0 per cent and inflation of 6.0 per cent over the Twelfth Plan 
(Scenario III). 
• The projected average rate of Gross Domestic Savings (GDS) during the 
Twelfth Plan ranges between 36.2 per cent (Scenario III) and 37.0 per cent 
(Scenario II). In all the three scenarios, there is the assumption of a 
turnaround in public sector saving which is expected to contribute significantly 
to the increase in the GDS rate over the Twelfth Plan. 
• The average estimated Current Account Deficit (CAD) ranges between 2.7 
per cent (Scenario III) and 3.9 per cent (Scenario II) of GDP during the 
Twelfth Plan. Net capital flows in scenarios I and III, besides financing the 
CAD, would moderately add to the reserves. CAD in the range of 2.7 to 3.0 
per cent of GDP is considered to be sustainable.  
• The Working Group acknowledged the following risks to the savings 
projections, viz., (i) The household savings rate could remain stagnant or 
even decline as financial liabilities increase with greater retail credit 
penetration; (ii) The projected increase in the public sector savings rate is 
contingent upon the continuance of the fiscal consolidation process; (iii) In 
respect of the private corporate sector, the sustainability of at least the current 
levels of efficiency would be important; and (iv) Large shocks to growth and 
inflation could alter the savings scenario during the Twelfth Plan.    
• The Working Group also estimated the flow of institutional credit to the 
agricultural sector at ` 42,080 billion during the Twelfth Plan. Credit supply to 
the MSME sector is projected between ` 76,490 billion and ` 85,710 billion. 
The flow of private resources for infrastructure is projected at ` 17,940 billion 
during the Twelfth Plan which would increase to  ` 26,670 billion, subject to 
the implementation of select measures; in the latter case, total (budgetary and 
private) projected flow of resources works out to around USD one trillion, 
assuming USD/INR exchange rate of 50.

4. Finances of Non-Government Non-Financial Public Limited Companies: 
2010-11 
The article presents the financial performance of select 3,485 non-
government non-financial public limited companies during the financial year 2010-11, 
based on their audited annual accounts.  
Main Findings 
• The aggregate results of the select companies have shown that the growth in 
sales and value of production improved in 2010-11 as compared with those in 
2009-10.  
• However, growth in various measures of profit, viz., PBDIT, gross profits 
(PBIT) and profits after tax moderated in 2010-11 mainly on account of 
relatively higher growth in manufacturing expenses than in sales.  
• The profitability ratios such as profit margin and return on equity contracted in 
2010-11as compared with that in 2009-10.  
• The share of external sources of funds (i.e., other than own sources) in the  
total sources of funds during the year increased mainly due to significant 
increase in incremental borrowing and trade dues and other current liabilities 
during 2010-11.Capital formation in uses of funds in 2010-11 was lower than 
in 2009-10. 
• However, corporate leverage as measured by the debt to equity ratio (debt as 
percentage of equity) declined gradually in the three year study period from 
2008-09 to 2010-11.
