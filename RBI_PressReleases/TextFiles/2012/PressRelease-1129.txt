RBI releases Financial Stability Report : June 2012 
The Reserve Bank of India today released the fifth issue of the Financial 
Stability Report (FSR) against the backdrop of worrisome global and domestic 
macroeconomic developments. Through these half-yearly FSRs, the Reserve Bank 
attempts to share the results of its macro prudential surveillance with the market, to 
encourage debate and to create awareness of the vulnerabilities in the system and 
even to suggest prompt corrective action. As in the case of the previous FSRs, this 
issue of the Report reflects the collective assessment of the Sub Committee of the 
Financial Stability and Development Council (FSDC) on potential risks to financial 
stability. 
Highlights:  
(1) The financial system of the country remains robust despite increase in risks to 
stability primarily due to global risks and domestic macroeconomic conditions. 
 
(Overview: Para 1) 
 
(2) The Reserve Bank’s second Systemic Risk Survey revealed concerns about 
the evolving global risks and a host of domestic factors. Respondents, 
however, remained confident about the stability of the domestic financial 
system.  
 
(Overview: Para 2; Chapter 5:para 5.1 – 5.6) 
 
(3) Risks to domestic growth are accentuated by fiscal and external sector 
imbalances. Inflationary pressures have moderated but inflation risks remain. 
 
 (Overview: Para 7-11; Chapter 1: para 1.7 – 1.30) 
 
(4) Foreign exchange and equity markets have corrected and continue to 
experience heightened volatility.  
 
(Overview: Para 12;14; Chapter 2: para 2.12 and 2.15)) 
 
(5) Banks remain resilient to credit, market and liquidity risks and would be able to 
withstand macroeconomic shocks, given their comfortable capital adequacy 
positions.  
(Overview: Para 22; Chapter 3: Para 3.41-3.49; Chapter 5: Para 5.29-5.33) 
(6) Asset quality concerns, however, persist and liquidity pressures have 
intensified. Credit and deposit growth in the banking sector have decelerated 
while banks’ reliance on borrowed funds has increased.  
 
 (Overview: Para 16, 17; Chapter 3: Para 3.6-3.11;3.13-3.20)

(7) Distress dependencies between banks have risen. The analysis of the network 
of the Indian banking system reveals that the systemic importance of the ‘most 
connected’ banks has increased, warranting a closer monitoring of the banks. 
      
 (Overview: Para 18;Chapter 5: para 5.16-5.18 and para 5.22-5.28)) 
 
(8) The policy framework for reforms, started after the global financial crisis, has 
crystalised. Several countries have announced their respective national policy 
frameworks for implementation of the reforms, e.g. migration to Basel III. 
Differences between such policy frameworks have led to concerns about cross 
border consistency.              
 
(Overview: Para 24; Chapter 4: 4.1-4.2) 
 
(9) There could be unintended consequences of the implementation of the reform 
measures for emerging economies, like India, e.g. due to the deleveraging 
induced by the new capital and liquidity standards.     
   
(Overview: Para 24; Chapter 4: 4.1-4.2) 
 
(10) Banks in India will migrate to Basel III from a position of relative strength but 
there could be challenges in the form of higher cost of capital. 
 
(Overview: 25; Chapter 4: para 4.3-4.5) 
 
(11) The new Principles for Financial Market Infrastructure, issued by the 
Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS) and the International 
Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), propose stringent risk 
management requirements, which could necessitate a relook at the risk 
management practices of domestic central counterparties.  
 
(Overview: 29; Chapter 4: para 4.36 –4.37) 
 
(12) Clearing Corporation of India Limited (CCIL)’s financial resources and its 
liquidity as well as credit risk management framework needs to be fine-tuned 
to take cognisance of the significant un-collateralised intraday exposures to its 
designated settlement banks.    
 
(Overview: Para 29; Chapter 4: para 4.25-4.28) 
 
The next FSR is scheduled to be published in December 2012.
