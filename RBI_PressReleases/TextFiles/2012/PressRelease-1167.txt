RBI Working Paper Series 8/2012 
        Volatility in Exchange Rate of Indian Rupee due to Spillover Effects of 
Other Markets 
The Reserve Bank of India today placed on its website a Working Paper No.8 
titled "Volatility Transmission in the Exchange Rate of the Indian Rupee". The Working 
Paper has been written by Shri Satyananda Sahoo. 
In an environment of growing integration among the financial markets, 
volatility in the exchange rate of a currency could not only be attributed to domestic 
macroeconomic and global factors but also attributed to spillover effects emanating 
from other volatile markets due to market microstructure in terms of differences in 
timing of trading activity, bid-ask spreads and risk perceptions.  In this context, this 
paper analyses volatility spillovers from the exchange rates of the Brazilian Real, the 
Russian Ruble, the South Korean Won, the Singapore Dollar, the Japanese Yen, the 
Swiss Franc, the British Pound Sterling and the Euro to the exchange rate of the 
Indian Rupee during 2005-11.  
The study employs a two-step multivariate generalised autoregressive 
conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) framework to examine the dynamics of 
exchange rate volatility and its spillovers which is also corroborated by examining 
simple pair-wise Granger causality tests. All the currencies included in the study 
exhibit presence of conditional autocorrelation and persistence of volatility in daily 
exchange rates. The findings support the view that volatilities observed in the 
exchange rate of the leading currencies, among other things, cause volatility in the 
daily exchange rate of the Indian Rupee.
