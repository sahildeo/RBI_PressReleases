3. Quarterly Industrial Outlook Survey: April-June 2012 (Round 58) 
This article presents the findings of Industrial Outlook Survey conducted for 
the April-June 2012 quarter - 58th round in the series. This survey provides an 
assessment of business situation of companies in manufacturing sector for the 
quarter April-June 2012, and their expectations for the ensuing quarter July-
September 2012.   
The results for Q1: 2012-13 showed a reversal of the marginal improvement 
in business sentiments of manufacturing sector observed in Q4: 2011-12. This was 
also reflected in the outlook of the previous round of the survey.

The Business Expectation Index (BEI), a composite indicator based on 
several business parameters, showed moderation for the assessment (from 114.9 to 
107.4) as well as for the expectation quarters (from 116.8 to 114.0). However, the 
indices remained in growth terrain. (Indices above 100 indicate expansion and below 
100 indicate contraction.) 
4. Quarterly Order Books, Inventories and Capacity Utilisation Survey: 
January-March 2012 (Round 17) 
This article, fourth in the series, presents the findings of Order Books, 
Inventories and Capacity Utilisation Survey (OBICUS) conducted for Q4:2011-12.  
The Survey results indicate an improvement in growth of new orders in 
Q4:2011-12 over the previous quarter. The year-on-year growth was, however, lower 
than that observed in the same quarter of previous year.  
Capacity utilisation level improved in Q4:2011-12 over the previous quarter 
(partly reflecting seasonality) and was close to the peak level observed in the 
corresponding quarter of previous year.  
Finished goods inventory to sales ratio moderated in Q4:2011-12 over the 
previous quarter. This ratio similarly was lower than that observed in Q4:2010-11. 
5. Inflation Expectations Survey of Households: June 2012 (Round 28) 
th
 The findings of 28 round of Inflation Expectations Survey of Households for 
April-June 2012 quarter, conducted during June 1 to June 10, 2012 are presented in 
the article.  
 The survey captures inflation expectations of 4,000 urban households across 
12 cities for the next three-month period and for the next one-year period. These 
expectations are based on their individual consumption baskets and hence, should 
not be considered as predictors of any official measure of inflation.  The households’ 
inflation expectations provide useful directional information on near-term inflationary 
pressures and also supplement other economic indicators to get a better indication 
of future inflation. The survey results are those of the respondents and not 
necessarily shared by the Reserve Bank of India. 
 According to the survey, the percentage of respondents expecting price rise in 
next three-month and in next one-year has gone up, mainly influenced by 
movements in food prices. Perception of the current inflation has gone up by 30 
basis points as compared with the previous round. The three-month and one-year 
ahead inflation expectations are higher than the perceived current inflation rate by 70 
and 150 basis points, respectively. 
6. Consumer Confidence Survey: June 2012 (Round 9) 
 This article presents the salient findings of the Consumer Confidence Survey 
th
conducted in June 2012, the 9 round in the series. The survey covers 5,189 
households well spread in six metro cities. It provides an assessment of the 
consumer sentiments of the respondents based on their perceptions of the general 
economic conditions and their own financial situation. Based on perceptions of the 
general economic and own financial situation, the survey captures the households’ 
confidence in the current and expected economic conditions, household 
circumstances, employment conditions, current and future spending and prices. The 
survey results reflect perceptions of the respondents and not of the Reserve Bank of 
India.

 According to the survey, households perceive the current economic conditions 
and conditions for the next one year to deteriorate in terms of net response. About 
half of the respondents, however, continue to feel that the current and future 
economic conditions are favourable.  
 Though majority of respondents have perceived household circumstances to 
be better, the proportion of respondents reporting worsening household 
circumstances has increased which led to decline in net response on household 
circumstances.  
 The net response on current income has declined, whereas the same relating 
to future income has marginally increased. The net response on current spending 
has decreased.  
 About half of the respondents reported ‘not particularly worried’ about the 
employment prospect leading to an improvement in net response.  
 Overall the current situation index has dropped from 115 to 107, while future 
expectations index remained at around 115 as in the last quarter.
