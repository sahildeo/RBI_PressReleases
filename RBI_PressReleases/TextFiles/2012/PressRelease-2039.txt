Macroeconomic and Monetary Developments: 
Third Quarter Review 2011-12 
The Reserve Bank of India today released the Macroeconomic and Monetary 
Developments Third Quarter Review 2011-12. The document serves as a backdrop to 
the Monetary Policy Statement to be announced on January 24, 2012. Highlights:   
Overall Outlook 
While growth outlook weakens, inflation risks remain 
• The Growth outlook has weakened as a result of adverse global and domestic 
factors. However, inflation and expectations of inflation remain high and upside risks 
emanate from exchange rate pass-through, revisions in administered prices and 
higher-than-expected government revenue spending. Consequently, monetary 
actions will need to strike a balance between risks to growth and inflation. 
• Growth in 2011-12 is moderating more than was expected earlier. The business 
climate has weakened. The slack in investment and net external demand may keep 
the pace of recovery slow in 2012-13.  
• While in the short run, moderating inflation will provide some space for monetary 
policy to address growth concerns, in the absence of structural measures to 
address supply bottlenecks, this will be, at best, a temporary respite. In addition, 
the expansionary fiscal stance has emerged as an upside risk to inflation.  
Global Economic Conditions 
Global growth moderates, financial market stress rises 
• The global economy seems to be headed for another downturn after just three 
years. The recovery is likely to lose traction due to the continuing euro area debt 
crisis. As fiscal austerity progresses, the euro area could enter into a recession. 
With growth decelerating even in emerging and developing economies (EDEs), the 
spillovers from euro area are likely to pull down global growth.  
• An adverse feedback loop between bank and sovereign debt brought euro area 
closer to contagion across the region. Tightening credit conditions, rising risk 
premia, deleveraging, weakening growth in the euro area are keeping global 
financial markets under stress. Going forward, further softening in commodity prices 
on the back of weaker global growth is likely in 2012-13. However, upside risks to 
the oil price remain, including from recent geo-political uncertainty.

Indian Economy 
Output 
Global linkages reinforce domestic factors to slow down economy 
• Agricultural prospects remain encouraging but moderation is visible in industrial 
activity and some services. Industrial slack has emerged as export and domestic 
demand has decelerated. A strong co-movement between domestic and global IIP 
series is observed. The RBI survey shows significant growth in new orders for some 
industries, but flat capacity utilisation in Q2 of 2011-12. 
• Growth in 2011-12 is likely to moderate to below trend given the external conditions, 
dampened investment demand and prevailing high level of inflation. Growth outlook 
will depend on global conditions and domestic policy reforms 
Aggregate Demand 
External and investment demand may drag growth  
• Growth has been impacted by lower external and investment demand which may 
also act as a drag during 2012-13. There has been a sharp decline in planned 
corporate fixed investment since H2 of 2010-11 and this trend has accentuated 
further in Q2 of 2011-12.  
• Private consumption continues to moderate. There has been some slackening of 
corporate sales growth, reflecting a gradual waning of demand. Available early 
results for Q3 of 2011-12, however, indicate healthy sales growth.  
• The central government’s deficit indicators are under duress due to higher 
subsidies and lower tax collections. Fiscal slippages during 2011-12 may 
complicate the task of aggregate demand management. Fiscal reforms, including 
the Direct Tax Code and the Goods and Services Tax are, therefore, needed to 
contain deficits in 2012-13. 
• With a widening current account deficit (CAD), larger fiscal spending could affect 
growth and stability in the economy. The mounting revenue deficit is already 
putting fiscal position under strain and impacting the Government’s ability for 
capital spending. There is need for budgetary solutions to growing subsidy 
commitments and to rebalance public spending from consumption to investment, 
in order to enhance the potential growth rate of the economy.  
External Sector 
CAD risks have amplified as capital flows moderate 
• Early indicators suggest that the current account came under increased pressure 
during Q3 of 2011-12. Notwithstanding rupee depreciation, exports decelerated 
but import demand remained strong, with inelastic demand for oil and rising gold 
imports. Upward risks to CAD have become more pronounced with likely 
moderation of software earnings. 
• As capital flows also moderated since August 2011, financing pressure on the 
CAD translated into exchange rate pressures. Currencies of other EDEs running 
CAD came under similar pressures. Following the revival of equity flows in 
January 2012, exchange rate pressures have reduced somewhat.  
• The composition of capital inflows has shifted in favour of debt, with a rise in the 
proportion of short-term flows. Vulnerability indicators have weakened moderately, 
though the net international investment position has improved. Going forward, 
there is need to reduce dependence on debt flows by encouraging renewed equity 
flows through acceleration of  policy reforms aimed at improving the investment 
climate  3 
 
Monetary and Liquidity Conditions 
Monetary growth keeps pace even as money market liquidity tightens 
• Money market liquidity tightened   significantly   since   November 2011 partly due to 
dollar sales by RBI. However, monetary growth has kept pace with projections, on 
account of a rising money multiplier. The liquidity stress was handled by the 
Reserve Bank by injecting liquidity through open market operations, including repos 
under the LAF. 
• Credit growth slowed below the indicative projection due to demand as well as 
supply side factors. Demand for credit weakened in response to slack in real   
activity. Supply also slowed down with rising risk aversion stemming from 
deteriorating macroeconomic conditions and rising non-performing loans. 
• Monetary policy has been significantly tightened since February 2010 with an 
effective increase of 525 bps in policy rates and a 100 bps increase in CRR. 
Factoring in increased downside risks to growth and the expected moderation in 
inflation, the policy rate was kept on hold in December 2011. The trajectory of the 
monetary cycle ahead will be shaped by the evolving growth-inflation dynamics.  
Financial Markets 
Financial markets come under pressure from global spillovers 
• Global spillovers and macroeconomic deterioration resulted in pressures on the 
equity and currency markets. The sharp depreciation of the rupee during August-
December 2011 contributed to a drop in foreign equity inflows which in turn, further 
weakened the rupee. The sudden stop in equity inflows also impacted investment 
financing. The impact was compounded by poor resource mobilisation in the primary 
capital market.  
• The stress in the financial markets was mitigated by policy measures that included 
infusion of rupee and dollar liquidity. As a result, the rupee exchange rate 
appreciated and equity markets recovered in January 2012.  Call money rates have 
largely remained within the interest rate corridor and spikes were effectively 
contained. 
Price Situation 
Inflation is trending down, but upside risks remains significant 
• Inflation is moderating led by sharp decline in food inflation and is broadly in line 
with the 7 per cent projection for March 2012.  
• Primary food inflation declined sharply reflecting seasonal fall in vegetable prices 
and high base. However, as protein inflation continues due to structural demand-
supply imbalances, the decline is expected to be short-lived.  
• Inflation in non-food manufactured products remains persistently high, reflecting 
input cost pressures, partly resulting from the rupee depreciation that has offset the 
impact of softer global prices of some commodities. 
• Upside risks to inflation persist from insufficient supply responses, exchange rate 
pass-through, suppressed inflation and an expansionary fiscal stance.
