Export Credit Refinance Facility (ECR) relaxed 
With a view to enhancing the credit flow to the export sector, it has been decided to 
enhance the eligible limit of the Export Credit Refinance (ECR) facility for scheduled banks 
(excluding RRBs) from 15 per cent of the outstanding export credit eligible for refinance to 
50 per cent, effective fortnight beginning June 30, 2012. This will provide additional liquidity 
support to banks of over `300 billion. The rate of interest charged on the ECR facility will 
continue to be the prevailing repo rate under the Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF), which is 
currently 8.0 per cent. 
At present, the Export Credit Refinance ECR limit is fixed at 15 per cent of the 
outstanding rupee export credit eligible for refinance as at the end of the second preceding 
fortnight.
