RBI releases Draft National Strategy for Financial Education for Comments 
The Reserve Bank of India today released on its website the draft National 
Strategy for Financial Education for comments and feedback. Comments can be 
emailed by August 15, 2012. 
The National Strategy recognises that financial literacy and financial 
education play a vital role in financial inclusion and inclusive growth and envisages 
ways towards creating awareness and educating consumers on access to financial 
services, availability of various types of products and their features; changing 
attitudes to translate knowledge into responsible financial behaviour; and making 
consumers of financial services understand their rights and obligations. 
The National Strategy seeks to create a financially aware and empowered 
India. It aims at undertaking a massive Financial Education campaign to help people 
manage money more effectively to achieve financial well being by accessing 
appropriate financial products and services through regulated entities with fair and 
transparent machinery for consumer protection and grievance redressal.  
The draft National Strategy has been prepared under the aegis of the Sub 
Committee of the Financial Stability and Development Council (FSDC) and is being 
simultaneously released for comments by all financial sector regulators.
