Working Group on Cloud computing option for small size UCBs 
The Reserve Bank of India has today placed on its website, the report of the 
Working Group on Cloud computing option for small size Urban Co-operative Banks 
(UCBs). The Working Group comprising senior officers from the Reserve Bank, 
experts from the software industry and eminent professors from academia was set 
up in July 2012.  The Working Group reviewed the profile of the sector, technological 
trends in Cloud Computing and use of cloud like solutions within UCBs. Based on 
the analysis, the Working Group has suggested its approach for Cloud computing 
option.  
The study observed that many Urban Cooperative banks have been providing 
IT support to other cooperative banks which included sharing of Data Centre and DR 
sites, Automated Teller Machines and Payment Gateways. Some of these banks 
were also providing their software solutions as outright sale or fees based ASP 
model. It was observed that two leading software company had been also offering 
cloud like services which included core banking as well as many other solutions such 
as HR solutions, e-mail, storage, etc which the banks could choose. These services 
were mostly on private cloud like set up.  
The Working Group has recommended caution while adopting cloud 
computing solutions by the Urban Cooperative banks till such time that all issues 
related to its standards and technology management processes are understood and 
resolved. In cases where such innovative solutions are already adopted, the Working 
Group has recommended that the issues identified in this report may be examined 
on the lines indicated in the report to ensure adequacy of risk mitigation measures 
and to address concern regarding data security and data privacy in the multi-tenancy 
environment. Finally the Working Group has identified the need for further study in 
the area of Cloud Governance, Cloud Audit, Cloud Management and Cloud Security 
Technology.
