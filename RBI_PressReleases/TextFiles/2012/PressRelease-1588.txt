RBI implements Web-based On-line Bidding for Primary Auctions of G-Secs 
 
 The Reserve Bank of India has, since February 2012, introduced an additional 
facility of web-based NDS auction module to facilitate online bidding by Constituents 
Subsidiary General Ledger clients (CSGL clients)/Gilt account holders (GAHs) in 
primary auctions of Government Securities (G-Secs).  
 
 Explaining the module, the Reserve Bank stated that the module permits 
internet-based direct participation of GAHs in primary auctions of G-Secs. However, 
the access is subject to controls by respective Primary Member (PM) as PM would 
continue to be responsible for settlement of CSGL bids/trades in respect of its GAHs, 
as is presently the case.  
 
 The web-based auction module is an additional facility and all regulations 
related to current CSGL account holders/PMs and client bidding system would 
remain, the Reserve Bank stated and added that all actions on web-based NDS 
auction application would also be governed by the extant Rules, Regulations, 
Notifications and/or any other instructions issued by it from time to time. The 
Reserve Bank would also have no role in any dispute between any GAH and its PM 
for any action performed on this application by either GAH or its PM. 
 
 Further details and operational guidelines on the web-based NDS auction 
facility are available on CCIL website (www.ccilindia.com). Market participants may 
also contact NDS-auction Helpdesk on 022-66639399 or mail to 
“auctionshelpdesk@ccilindia.co.in” in regard to any further queries on the 
application.
