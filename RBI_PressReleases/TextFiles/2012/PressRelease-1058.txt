RBI releases the gist of comments on the  
draft guidelines for licensing of new banks 
 
           The Reserve Bank of India released on its website today, the gist of 
comments and suggestions received on the draft guidelines for licensing of new 
banks in the private sector which were placed on its website on August 29, 2011. 
Comments and suggestions were received from general public, consultants, 
analysts, industrial / business houses, NBFCs, etc. The comments received are wide 
ranging and span across various issues relating to licensing of new banks in the 
private sector. 
It may be recalled that pursuant to the announcement made by Union Finance 
Minister in his budget speech for the year 2010-11 that the Reserve Bank was 
considering giving some additional banking licences to private sector players, a 
Discussion Paper on Entry of New Banks in the Private Sector was placed on the 
Reserve Bank’s website on August 11, 2010. Thereafter, upon examination of 
comments and suggestions received on the Discussion Paper and in consultation 
with the Government, the draft guidelines on licensing of new banks were released 
on the Reserve Bank website on August 29, 2011 inviting views and comments from 
banks, non-banking financial institutions, industrial houses, other institutions and the 
public at large by October 31, 2011.  
The draft guidelines on licensing of new banks contained provisions relating to 
the following aspects:  
 
• Eligible promoters 
• Corporate structure 
• Minimum capital requirements and holding by NOHC 
• Foreign shareholding in the bank 
• Corporate governance 
• Business model  
• Other conditions 
• Additional considerations in respect of promoter groups having 40% or more 
assets / income from non-financial business 
The Reserve Bank will take these suggestions / comments into account while 
finalizing the guidelines.
