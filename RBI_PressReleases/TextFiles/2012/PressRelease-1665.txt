The Reserve Bank of India has imposed a monetary penalty of `5.00 lakh 
(Rupees five lakh only) on the Sulaimani Co-operative Bank Limited, Vadodara 
(Gujarat) in exercise of powers vested in it under the provisions of Section 
47(A)(1)(b) read with Section 46(4) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (As 
applicable to Co-operative Societies), for violation of operational instructions 
imposed on the bank by RBI, non-adherence to exposure ceiling prescribed for 
unsecured advances, non-reporting of loans and advances granted to Directors, 
non-compliance with KYC norms and AML guidelines, etc.
