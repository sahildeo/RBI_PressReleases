Further Relaxations to Exchange Earners, 
Exporters and AD Category-I Banks 
 
Reserve Bank of India has reviewed the extant guidelines governing 
Exchange Earner’s Foreign Currency (EEFC) Accounts, cancellation and rebooking 
of forward contracts booked by the exporters and the Net Overnight Open Position 
Limit (NOOPL) of the Authorised Dealer Category-I Banks. In order to provide 
operational flexibility to exchange earners/ exporters and AD Category-I banks, it has 
been decided: 
• To restore the erstwhile stipulation of allowing credit of 100 percent foreign 
exchange earnings to the EEFC accounts subject to the condition that the 
sum total of the accruals in the account during a calendar month should be 
converted into Rupees on or before the last day of the succeeding calendar 
month after adjusting for utilization of the balances for approved purposes or 
forward commitments;  
 
• To allow exporters to cancel and rebook forward contracts to the extent of 25 
percent of the total contracts booked for hedging their exposure; and 
 
• For computation of Net Overnight Open Position involving Rupee as one of 
the currencies, AD Category-I banks need not include the positions taken by 
their overseas branches and also the delta of the Options Position. It is, 
however, clarified that these positions will continue to be part of the total 
NOOPL along with cross-currency positions and positions arising out of 
exchange traded currency futures/options transactions for calculation of the 
total foreign currency exposure of banks.
