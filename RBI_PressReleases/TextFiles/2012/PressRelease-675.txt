RBI releases its Monthly Bulletin for September 2012 
The Reserve Bank of India today released the September 2012 issue of its 
monthly Bulletin. The Bulletin includes five special articles: i) India’s Foreign Trade: 
2012-13 (April-June), ii) Monthly Seasonal Factors of Selected Economic Time 
Series, iii) International Banking Statistics of India: December 2011 and March 2012, 
iv) Corporate Investment: Growth in 2011-12 and Prospects for 2012-13 and v) 
Performance of Private Corporate Business Sector during 2011-12.  
1. India’s Foreign Trade: 2012-13 (April-June) 
This article reviews India’s merchandise trade performance during April-June 
2012-13 (Q1) on the basis of data released by the Directorate General of 
Commercial Intelligence and Statistics (DGCI&S). It also analyses disaggregated 
commodity-wise and direction-wise details for the year 2011-12. 
Highlights 
• During Q1 of 2012-13, exports stood at US$ 75.2 billion and showed a decline 
of 1.7 per cent as against an increase of 36.4 per cent during Q1 of 2011-12. 
The significant deceleration in export performance observed in the second half 
of 2011-12 continued during Q1 of 2012-13, as global economic and trade 
environment remained unsupportive. 
• During Q1 of 2012-13, imports declined by 6.1 per cent over the corresponding 
quarter of 2011-12 and stood at US$ 115.3 billion. Lower imports during Q1 of 
2011-12 mainly reflected the contraction in imports of gold and silver and a 
moderate growth in imports of petroleum, oil and lubricants (POL). 
• Lower growth in POL imports at 5.5 per cent during Q1 of 2012-13 as 
compared with a growth of 52.5 per cent  during Q1 of 2011-12 could be partly 
reflecting the moderation in international crude oil prices.  
• Imports of gold and silver at US$ 9.4 billion during Q1 of 2012-13 were 48.4 
per cent lower than that in Q1 of 2011-12. 
• Non-oil non-gold imports during Q1 of 2012-13 at US$ 65.3 billion recorded a 
decline of 2.9 per cent as compared to an increase of 18.9 per cent in Q1 of 
preceding year.  
• Trade deficit during Q1 of 2012-13 stood lower at US$ 40.1 billion as compared 
with US$ 46.2 billion during Q1 of 2011-12.  
• Commodity-wise data on merchandise exports for the year 2011-12 show that 
engineering goods, petroleum products, chemicals, textiles, gems & jewellery 
and agricultural products accounted for more than 89 per cent of India’s 
exports.

• During 2011-12, while the share of European Union in India’s total 
merchandise exports declined marginally, the same of OPEC countries 
declined by more than two percentage points. 
2. Monthly Seasonal Factors of Selected Economic Time Series 
This article presents the estimated monthly seasonal factors of selected 99 
major macroeconomic  series, for the period 2002-03 to 2011-12, broadly covering 
five major sectors, namely, Monetary and Banking Indicators (20 series), Prices 
(WPI/CPI) (32 series), Industrial Production (37 series), External Trade (2 series), 
and Services Sector Indicators (8 series). 
Main Findings 
• The estimated seasonal factors and the variation over time revealed that 
seasonal variations of M3, Currency in circulation and M1 declined gradually. 
However, the seasonal variations of Reserve Money (RM) increased since 
2008-09. 
• For Scheduled Commercial Banks, an upward movement in the seasonal 
variation of Non-Food Credit and Investments was observed in the recent 
years, while the seasonal variation of Aggregate Deposits showed a decrease. 
Within Aggregate Deposits, Demand Deposits exhibited higher seasonal 
fluctuations than Time Deposits. 
• Among the price related series, seasonal variation for WPI-All commodities 
remained low and exhibited steady decline in recent years. The variation in 
seasonality for WPI-Primary Articles was much higher than that of WPI-
Manufactured products. For WPI-Fuel and Power group, no significant 
seasonality was observed. However, the subgroup of freely priced products 
(excluding petrol) showed significant seasonal variation. Seasonal variation of 
CPI-IW was observed to be stable in the recent years but consistently higher 
than in WPI-All Commodities and marginally lower than CPI-AL and CPI-RL. 
• With respect to production data, seasonal variation of IIP-General Index was 
seen to increase steadily over the time period. The seasonal peaks of IIP-
General, sectoral and use-based group indices occurred in March every year. 
The seasonal trough, however, occurred in different months. Among the use-
based classification of IIP, ‘Capital Goods’ and 'Intermediate Goods' showed 
the highest and lowest seasonal variations, respectively. 
• During 2011-12, 45 out of the 99 select series had registered their seasonal 
peaks in March. In terms of seasonal variations, over the last five years, the 
top five series were ‘IIP-Office, accounting and computing machinery’, ‘IIP-
Food products and beverages’, ‘Coal Production’, ‘WPI-Potatoes’, and ‘WPI-
Onions’; while bottom five series were ‘WPI- Manufactured Products’, ‘WPI-All 
Commodities’, ‘WPI-Non Food Manufactured Products’, ‘WPI-Food Products’ 
and ‘WPI-Milk’. 
3. International Banking Statistics of India: December 2011 and March 2012  
The article presents analysis of international liabilities and assets of banks in 
India, classified under Locational Banking Statistics (LBS) and consolidated 
international/foreign claims under Consolidated Banking Statistics (CBS), collected 
as per the reporting system of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), for the 
quarters ended December 2011 and March 2012.

Main Findings 
Locational Banking Statistics - International Liabilities 
• The international liabilities (in ` terms) of banks in India, at end-March 2012 
grew by 8.6 per cent over the position a year ago and by 8.2 per cent over the 
previous quarter. 
• Foreign currency borrowings, NRO and NRE deposits contributed to the high 
growth in the international liabilities. The share of equities of banks held by 
non-residents in the total liabilities, however, declined in the last two quarters. 
• At end-March 2012, the annual increase in the international liabilities emanated 
from the increase in exposure towards various countries,    primarily, the USA, 
UK, Hong Kong and Singapore.  
• The share of the international liabilities towards the non-bank sector was 
marginally lower at 73.3 per cent as compared with 74.0 per cent a year ago. 
Locational Banking Statistics - International Assets 
• At end-March 2012, the international assets (in ` terms) of banks in India 
registered a substantial growth of 21.6 per cent over the position a year ago 
and an increase of 7.9 per cent over the previous quarter.  
• The high annual growth in international assets at end-March 2012 can be 
ascribed to each of the items under the major component 'Loans and Deposits'. 
• The share of the non-bank sector in total international assets declined to 62.3 
per cent at end-March 2012 from 66.5 per cent a year ago.  
• At end-March 2012, the share of the international assets denominated in US 
Dollar increased further to 81.3 per cent from 79.2 per cent a year ago. 
Consolidated Banking Statistics 
• The annual growth in consolidated international claims (in ` terms) of banks 
based on country of immediate risk, as at end-March 2012, was 14.0 per cent 
as compared to the annual growth of 5.9 per cent a year ago. 
• Major part of consolidated international claims of Indian banks on immediate 
risk basis, at end-March 2012, continued to be of short-term nature (less than 
one year) and accounted for 65.2 per cent of total claims as compared with 
62.5 per cent a year ago.                                                         
4. Corporate Investment: Growth in 2011-12 and Prospects for 2012-13 
This article captures capital investment intentions of companies in private and 
joint business sector in order to broadly assess the likely short-term changes in 
business sentiment. The estimation of capital investment during the year is based on 
phasing details of investment intentions indicated by companies while raising funds 
through sanctioned assistance by banks/financial institutions, ECB/FCCBs and 
domestic equity. Capital expenditure envisaged from pipeline projects are also 
estimated for the year 2012-13.  
Main Findings:  
• New investment intentions in 2011-12 aggregating ` 2,509 billion were lower by 
41.0 per cent as compared to  ` 4,263 billion  in the previous year.  
• Industries, such  as, power, metal & metal products, telecom, cement and hotel 
& restaurants witnessed decrease in total project cost; whereas, textile, 
chemical & pesticides and transport services observed an increase in total 
project cost in 2011-12 as against in 2010-11. 4 
 
• Maharashtra, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan were preferred 
destinations of investment and witnessed an increase in share in the total 
envisaged projects in 2011-12 when compared to last year. The shares of 
Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh (which attracted the highest investment last 
year) and Odisha have, however, gone down. 
• The capital expenditure already planned to be spent in 2012-13 aggregated  
`2,073 billion. Even if companies adhere to their investment plans, the 
envisaged investment by the private corporate sector in 2012-13 is expected to 
be significantly lower than that in the previous year. 
5. Performance of Private Corporate Business Sector during 2011-12
The article analyses the performance of private corporate sector in 2011-12 
based on the abridged financial results of 2,679 non-government non-financial 
(NGNF) listed companies and provides, inter alia, a brief analysis by size and 
industry.   
Main Findings: 
• The sales growth of the private (non-financial) corporate business sector 
moderated during 2011-12. The deceleration in sales growth was sharper in 
the fourth quarter of 2011-12. Growth in profits declined sharply on account of 
continued pressure from rising raw material costs and relatively higher growth 
in power & fuel and interest cost.  
• Profitability, in terms of operating, gross and net profit margins (expressed as 
percentage to sales) contracted for the second consecutive year. 
• In terms of the sectoral breakdown, sales growth was higher for companies in 
the manufacturing sector as compared to those in the services sector. 
However, IT sector with significant support from other income witnessed 
substantial growth in net profits during 2011-12 unlike the manufacturing and 
services other than IT, where the net profits declined. 
• The performance of bigger companies (sales above `10 billion) was relatively 
better. However, profit margins contracted for all size classes
