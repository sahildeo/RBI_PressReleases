RBI places on its Website Draft Guidelines based on  
Usha Thorat Committee Report on Issues and Concerns in NBFC Sector 
          In order to adopt a consultative approach, the Reserve Bank of India has, 
today, placed on its website, draft guidelines to address issues and concerns in the 
NBFC sector. The draft guidelines are based on recommendations made by the 
Working Group on the Issues and Concerns chaired by Smt. Usha Thorat, former 
Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India. The Report of the Working Group was 
placed on RBI website in August 2011. 
         It may be recalled that the Working Group was constituted to review the 
existing regulatory and supervisory framework of non-banking finance companies 
(NBFCs). The objectives of the Working Group were to address issues relating to 
regulatory arbitrage and systemic risk, so as to create a strong and resilient non-
banking financial sector.  
 The draft revised guidelines relate to entry point norms, principal business 
criteria, prudential regulations, liquidity requirements for NBFCs and corporate 
governance.  While accepting some of the suggestions, the Bank has been mindful 
that their implementation should not disrupt the sector. Hence, ample transition time 
has been proposed to bring the new regulatory framework into existence.  
Comments/suggestions on the draft guidelines may be forwarded to the Chief 
General Manager-in-Charge, Department of Non-Banking Supervision, Reserve 
Bank of India, Central Office, WTC, Cuffe Parade, Mumbai-400 005 or emailed latest 
by January 10, 2013.
