RBI rationalises customer charges for NEFT 
The Reserve Bank of India has, in consultation with stakeholders, today 
rationalised charges that banks can levy on customers for transfer of funds through 
National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT).  Now banks can levy not more than 
`2.50 (exclusive of service tax) for funds transfer upto `10,000. Charges for transfers 
beyond this limit would remain unchanged, that is, `5 for transfers between `10,001 
to Rupees one lakh; `15 for transfers between Rupees one lakh and above and upto 
`2 lakh; and `25 for transfers beyond  ` 2 lakh. 
These charges would become effective from August 1, 2012. The customer 
charges were last revised in November 2010. 
Explaining the revision, the Reserve Bank has stated that NEFT transactions 
have grown exponentially in the recent years. It is desirable that the benefits 
accruing on account of increasing volume of transactions are passed on to the 
customers in the form of lower charges. This would also incentivise greater use of 
the electronic payment system. Further, it is considered necessary to provide the 
large number of people being covered under the financial inclusion programme with 
an efficient and affordable remittance mechanism like the NEFT.
