Foreign Exchange Department of the Reserve Bank of India,  
implements the Application Tracking System 
The Application Tracking System (ATS) is a major e-Governance initiative of 
the Reserve Bank of India. 
Foreign Exchange Department, Central Office and its 17 Regional offices 
have since adopted the ATS, to facilitate the customers to apply and track the status 
of the applications online. 
Under the online Application Tracking System (ATS), customers can submit 
applications online  and also track the status of an already filed / submitted 
application. The applicant would be required to login with email id and password as 
registered with the RBI website. In respect of those applications, being submitted 
physically at the counters of the Foreign Exchange Department, a valid email id is 
required to be indicated in the letter / application. An auto generated information will 
be sent to the email id given upon receipt of an application and also at the time of 
disposal of an application by the Department. Status of all letters / applications          
( other than statements and returns) requiring a reply from the Foreign Exchange 
Department can be tracked by accessing the ATS. ATS can easily be accessed on 
the homepage of RBI  (www.rbi.org.in). FAQs on use of ATS are also available on 
the RBI website under FAQs > Others > Application Tracking System (ATS).
