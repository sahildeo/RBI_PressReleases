The deceleration was more prominent across urban and metropolitan centres.
However, growth in deposits of semi-urban branches and in gross bank credit
in rural branches was higher than a year ago.

accounted for 69.1 per cent of the total deposits and the top hundred
centres arranged according to the size of bank credit accounted for 78.3 per
cent of total bank credit.

cent of the bank offices, 97.8 per cent of aggregate deposits and 95.8 per
cent of gross bank credit. The offices with outstanding credit of Rs.100 million
or more accounted for 47.6 per cent of the offices, 79.7 per cent of deposits
and 95.7 per cent of total bank credit.
· Nationalised banks, SBI and its associates and private sector banks
accounted for 53.0 per cent, 21.8 per cent and 17.8 per cent of aggregate

credit, respectively.
