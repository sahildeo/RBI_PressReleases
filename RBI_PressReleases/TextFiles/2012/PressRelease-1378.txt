RBI Working Paper Series : 7 / 2012
Measures of Nominal and Real Effective Lending Rates of Banks in India
With progressive deregulation of interest rates in the 90s, loan pricing
mechanism of banks in India witnessed a significant change. However, in the
absence of a comprehensive measure of nominal effective lending rate for the
commercial banks, assessment of this change remained challenging. In this context,
this paper provides a comparable annual time series on weighted average lending
rates (WALR) for bank credit in India for the period 1992-2010 based on the
comprehensive BSR database. The WALR series so constructed makes available a
larger dataset than used earlier. This is expected to bridge an important data gap for
empirical assessment of the bank lending rate channel of monetary transmission.
WALR in nominal terms for the banking industry as a whole and across all sectors
has shown a gradual decline. Further, the hypothesis of inverse relationship between
output and real lending rate derived from nominal WALR based on WPI and GDP
deflator is tested in a simple regression framework. The results were on the
expected lines. Moreover, the strength of the relationship improved in the period
1997-2010 reflecting the effects of progressive deregulation of lending rates which
enhanced the sensitivity of output to interest rate.
