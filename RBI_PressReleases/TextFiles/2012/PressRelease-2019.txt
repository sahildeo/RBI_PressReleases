Inflation Forecasting: Issues and Challenges in India : RBI Working Paper 
Series  
The Reserve Bank of India today placed on its website a Working Paper 
Series for the month of January 2012 titled "Inflation Forecasting: Issues and 
Challenges in India" by Shri Muneesh Kapur. 
In view of long and variable transmission lags, it is important for monetary 
policy to respond to expected inflation and output dynamics. Reliable forecasts of 
growth and inflation are, therefore, important for effective monetary management. 
The paper focuses on modelling and forecasting inflation in India using an 
augmented Phillips curve framework. Both demand and supply factors are seen 
as drivers of inflation. Demand conditions are found to have a stronger impact on 
non-food manufactured products inflation (NFMP) vis-a-vis headline WPI 
inflation; moreover, NFMP is found to be more persistent than headline inflation. 
Both these findings support the use of NFMP as a core measure of inflation. But, 
the impact of global non-fuel commodities on NFMP is found to be substantial, 
which tempers the case for using NFMP as a core measure. Inflation in non-fuel 
commodities is seen as a more important driver of domestic inflation rather than 
fuel inflation, although the focus more often is on fuel prices.  
 
The exchange rate pass-through coefficient is found to be modest, but 
nonetheless sharp depreciation in a short period of time, as it occurred during 
July-September 2011, can fuel inflationary pressures. The estimated equations 
show a satisfactory in-sample performance based on dynamic simulations. 
Nonetheless, forecasting challenges emanate from volatility in international oil 
and other commodity prices and domestic food supply dynamics. These supply-
side factors have exhibited significant volatility in the recent years and add 
complexity to inflation dynamics and its forecasting. Finally, structural food 
inflation emanating from protein-rich items and fruits and vegetables has 
emerged as a key driver of domestic inflation. Though this factor has not been 
considered in the paper it would be useful to incorporate them in the modelling 
framework for a better understanding of inflation dynamics.
