The terms of reference of the Committee are: 
(i) to review and recommend measures for deepening and widening the money, 
foreign exchange and government securities markets including those relating 
to participants, products, institutional and infrastructural arrangements etc.; 
(ii) to suggest measures for development of market and promoting liquidity in 
money market instruments, foreign exchange market and government 
securities; 
(iii) to examine and advise on the evolving and desirable linkages among the 
money, foreign exchange and government securities and capital markets; 
(iv) to review the infrastructure, legal and institutional arrangements for trading, 
transfer and settlement in the money, foreign exchange and government 
securities markets in the context of the emerging payments system including 
CCIL; 
(v) to prepare and consider papers on topics relating to product/market 
development and advise on the policies and practices for the same. 
(vi) to review the qualitative and quantitative aspects of risk management, 
accounting, disclosure, settlement, legal framework etc. in the money, foreign 
exchange and government securities markets and render advise, and 
(vii)  to examine any other relevant issue having a bearing on these markets 
referred to it, by RBI. 
 The Committee may appoint Technical Groups consisting of its own members 
and/or outside experts to study and submit recommendations on specific issues, if 
necessary.  The Committee will meet as often as it is required, but at least once in a 
quarter and will function for two years from the date of its first meeting. 
It may be recalled that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had first constituted 
the Technical Advisory Committee on Money and Government Securities Markets on 
July 12, 1999 for a tenure of two years. So far, the TAC has been reconstituted on 
four occasions, viz., in September 2001, February 2004, June 2006 and January 
2009. Keeping in view the inter-linkages between Money, Foreign Exchange and 
Government Securities Markets and implications for monetary policy operations, the 
ambit of the TAC was widened, at the time of its reconstitution in February 2004, to 
include the foreign exchange markets. The TAC is now being reconstituted so that 
the Reserve Bank can continue obtaining the benefit of opinion from financial market 
experts from areas such as, banking, academics, Government, stock exchanges, 
credit rating agencies and market representatives. The confluence of ideas and the 
advice brought about by this wide representation has enabled the Reserve Bank to 
make further reforms in financial markets, including products, practices, institutional 
arrangements and regulation in these markets.  
 The TAC held its first meeting on May 2, 2012 at Reserve Bank of India, 
Central Office Mumbai to discuss recommendations of the Working Group 
(Chairman: Shri R. Gandhi) that was set up to examine ways to enhance liquidity in 
the G-Sec and Interest Rate Derivatives Markets.
