Disruption in NEFT Operations on June 5 – 6, 2012: RBI 
 
There was a delay in the processing of transactions in the Reserve Bank of 
India’s National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT) system on June 5, 2012. Due to 
some technical glitches transactions were relayed to the destination banks with 
some delay. By late evening of June 6, 2012, these issues were addressed to a 
large extent. The Reserve Bank, however, continues to monitor and address some 
residual issues. 
 
Meanwhile, to ensure that customers were not unduly inconvenienced, the 
Reserve Bank temporarily brought down the threshold limit in Real Time Gross 
Settlement System (RTGS) to Rupees one lakh from the existing Rs. 2 lakh. This 
arrangement would continue till Saturday, June 9, 2012. Banks have also been 
advised to levy only applicable NEFT charges for transactions in the value band of 
Rs. 1 to 2 lakh even though the transactions were routed through RTGS. 
 
The Reserve Bank would like to thank all the banks and their customers for 
putting up with the inconvenience.  
 
NEFT is a pan-India one-to-one funds transfer system used by individuals, 
corporates and Governments. The transactions in the system are put through 
various bank branches across the country. The volume of transactions processed in 
NEFT over the last three years has witnessed a 100 per cent year-on-year growth. 
On an average, around 18 million transactions are processed every month in the 
system. The system has been operational since 2005.
