Half-yearly Report on Management of  
Foreign Exchange Reserves (September 2011) 
 
The Reserve Bank of India has released the 17th half-yearly report on 
management of foreign exchange reserves with reference to September 2011. 
 
It may be recalled that in February 2004, the Reserve Bank had 
commenced a process of compiling half yearly reports and placing them in the 
public domain with a lag of about three months for bringing about more 
transparency and also for enhancing the level of disclosure.  
The first such report for the half year ended September 30, 2003 was 
released on February 3, 2004.
