The Reserve Bank of India has been awarded the 2012 Dufrenoy Prize for its 
precautionary approach to the regulation of derivatives market, thus facilitating 
Financial Innovation in a responsible manner. Shri G Padmanabhan, Executive 
Director, and Smt. Shyamala Gopinath, former Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of 
India received the award in a ceremony held in Paris on June 18, 2012.  
Thanking the Observatory for Responsible Innovation – an independent 
international think tank - for recognizing and appreciating the Reserve Bank “for the 
very reason it was criticized not so long ago,” Shri Padmanabhan, in his acceptance 
speech said, “The observations of the honourable jury members about the Indian 
regulatory approach being precautionary and gradual, with a culture of testing and 
paying attention to potential negative effects of sophisticated financial products before 
facilitating them, precisely encapsulates the culture and methodology of  the Reserve 
Bank of India,  as it seeks to fulfill its mandate - by juggling the  multifarious roles 
assigned to it –  of  maintaining  stability of both prices and the financial system and 
supporting  economic growth.”  
Dufrenoy Prize for Responsible Innovation is an annual award instituted by 
Observatory for Responsible Innovation. The Observatory – a MINES ParisTech Chair 
and an international independent think tank - has been created with the purpose of 
thinking and debating new measures, concepts and methods to foster responsibility in 
innovation. The MINES ParisTech was set up in 1783, and has two Nobel Prize winners 
among its alumni in the last 25 years, apart from other eminent national and 
international personalities. Nominations for the Dufrenoy award were invited through the 
Observatory web-site.  A jury of international regulators, former professionals of the 
financial services industry, academics at the London School of Economics and MINES 
ParisTech decided to bestow the award for 2012 to the Reserve Bank of India for its 
outstanding approach of financial regulation.
