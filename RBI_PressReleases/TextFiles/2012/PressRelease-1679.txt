Co-operative Bank Ltd., Bhusawal, Jalgaon (Maharashtra) 
In view of the fact that The Bhusawal People’s Co-operative Bank Ltd., 
Bhusawal, Jalgaon (Maharashtra), had ceased to be solvent, all efforts to revive it in 
close consultation with the Government of Maharashtra had failed and the depositors 
were being inconvenienced by continued uncertainty, the Reserve Bank of India 
[RBI] delivered the order cancelling its licence to the bank and the same is effective 
from the close of business as on March 22, 2012. The Registrar of Co-operative 
Societies, Maharashtra has also been requested to issue an order for winding up the 
bank and appoint a liquidator for the bank.  It may be highlighted that on liquidation, 
every depositor is entitled to repayment of his/her deposits up to a monetary ceiling 
of `1,00,000/- (Rupees One lakh only) from the Deposit Insurance and Credit 
Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) under usual terms and conditions.  
The bank was granted a licence by RBI on March 31, 1980 to commence 
banking business. The statutory inspection of the bank under Section 35 of the 
Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (As Applicable to Co-operative Societies) (hereinafter 
referred to as the ‘Act’), with reference to its financial position as on March 31, 2006 
revealed that the gross and net NPAs were assessed at 19.0% & 15.2% of gross 
and net advances, respectively. The total loss of the bank for the year 2005-06 was 
assessed at (-)`34.15 lakh.  
The bank was issued operational instructions based on the findings of 
inspection with reference to its financial position as on March 31, 2006. The bank’s 
exposure limits for lending to individual / group borrowers was restricted to 10% and 
25% of its capital funds vide RBI’s letter dated September 20, 2006. The bank was 
further prohibited vide letter dated February 5, 2009 to make any fresh lending or  to 
renew any credit facility except those which are classified as standard.  
             The financial parameters of the bank continued to deteriorate further as 
revealed during subsequent inspections conducted with reference to its financial 
position as on March 31, 2007; March 31, 2008; March 31, 2009; and March 31,

In view of the deteriorating financial position, the bank was placed under all 
inclusive directions under Section 35 A of the Act from the close of business as on 
October 25, 2011 vide directive UBD.CO.BSD1/D-60/12.22.027/2011-12 dated 
October 24, 2011 placing restrictions on its activities.
Serious deficiencies as mentioned above revealed that the affairs of the bank 
were being conducted in a manner detrimental to the interests of the depositors. The 
bank did not comply with the provisions of Sections 11(1), 22(3) (a) and 22(3) (b) of 
the Act. Based on the financial position of the bank as on March 31, 2011 the bank 
was issued a Show Cause Notice (SCN) vide letter dated November 23, 2011 to 
show cause as to why the licence granted to it on March 31, 1980 to carry on 
banking business under Section 22 of the Act should not be cancelled and the bank 
be taken into liquidation. The bank had submitted reply to the SCN vide its letter 
dated December 21, 2011 and the same was examined and not found to be 
satisfactory. The bank had not submitted any concrete viable revival plan or merger 
proposal. 
Therefore, RBI took the extreme measure of cancelling licence of the bank in 
the interest of bank's depositors. With the cancellation of licence and 
commencement of liquidation proceedings, the process of paying the depositors of 
the The Bhusawal People’s Co-operative Bank Ltd., Bhusawal, Jalgaon 
(Maharashtra) the amount insured as per the DICGC Act, will be set in motion 
subject to the terms and conditions of the Deposit Insurance Scheme. 
Consequent to the cancellation of its licence, The Bhusawal People’s Co-
operative Bank Ltd., Bhusawal, Jalgaon (Maharashtra) is prohibited from carrying on 
‘banking business’ as defined in Section 5(b) of the Act.
