RBI releases “Statistical Tables Relating to Banks in India 2011-12”  
The Reserve Bank of India today released the Statistical Tables Relating to 
Banks in India 2011-12 – an annual publication that provides key information on 
banks.  
The publication provides bank-wise and bank group-wise information on major 
items such as liabilities and assets, income and expenses, non-performing assets, 
financial ratios, spatial distribution of offices, number of employees and details of 
priority sector advances. It also provides bank group-wise monthly data on some of 
the major items that include aggregate deposits, liabilities to the banking system, 
assets with the banking system, investments, bank credit, and sector-wise and 
industry-wise gross bank credit.  
  The analysis based on the data presented in the publication shows that –  
• Credit–Deposit ratio of all scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) at 
aggregate level increased in 2011-12.  
• Ratio of demand and savings bank deposits to total deposits of all SCBs at 
aggregate level declined in 2011-12. 
• Net interest margin (NIM) for all SCBs marginally declined during 2011-12. 
At the bank group level, NIM of “SBI and Its Associates” and “Foreign 
Banks” increased, while NIM of “Nationalised Banks” and “New Private 
Sector Banks” declined. 
• Profitability in terms of return on assets of all SCBs at the aggregate level 
declined during 2011-12. At bank group level, return on assets declined in 
respect of “Nationalised Banks”, while all other bank groups witnessed an 
increase in return on assets during 2011-12.  
• Cost of funds increased for all the bank-groups in 2011-12. At the same 
time, return on advances and return on investments also increased for all 
bank-groups.  
Copies of the publication are available with the Director, Division of Reports 
and Knowledge Dissemination (Sales Section), Department of Economic and Policy 
Research, Reserve Bank of India, Amar Building, Ground Floor, P. M. Road, Fort,
