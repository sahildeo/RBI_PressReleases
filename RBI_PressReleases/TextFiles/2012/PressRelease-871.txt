specific issues. The following decisions were taken at this meeting: 
 
• Banks should ensure qualitative coverage of Financial Inclusion through 
proper functioning of BCs.

no-frill accounts opened with them are for all purposes and not linked to 
just one government scheme. 
• In four identified districts of Maharashtra, four lead banks would organize a 
convention of banking correspondents before September 15, 2012 to 
assess the issues affecting the smooth operation of the BC-ICT Model in 
the villages.  State Government would nominate District Collector to the 
convention. 
??????????• Banks should ensure to open accounts for every household in 8 blocks 
identified last year in Maharashtra and 5 more districts identified in the 
Union Budget.   The account would be all purpose accounts and would be 
linked to transmitting payments to account holders for all purpose.   District 
administration will make available updated list of beneficiaries of various 
social and subsidy schemes for the purpose. 
• In the 7 districts, where DCCBs are under Direction, Lead Banks would 
take support of PACS to fill up applications for crop loans and process 
them expeditiously.  Registrar of Cooperative Societies would lend his 
support in expediting the job.  
• In case of RSETIs, where land has been allocated and financial grant has 
been released by government, banks should ensure that the training 
establishments are set up at the earliest.
