RBI releases Draft Payment System Vision Document 2012-15 
 for Public Comments 
The Reserve Bank of India, today released on its website, the draft Payment 
System Vision Document 2012-15 for public consultation. Comments on the Vision 
Document are invited from members of the public, academia, industry and other 
stakeholders. Comments can be sent by email by 31 July, 2012. 
The Payments System Vision Document 2012-15 envisages by ways and 
means of ensuring that “payment and settlement systems in the country are safe, 
efficient, interoperable, authorised, accessible, inclusive and compliant with 
international standards”. Accordingly, it proposes to “proactively encourage 
electronic payment systems for ushering in a less-cash society in India” as its Vision. 
The Reserve Bank had earlier published a Vision Document outlining the 
course of action that would be undertaken in the field of payment and settlement 
systems over a three year period. The tasks laid out in the above document have 
been completed to a large extent. The new Vision Document intends to take the 
Mission further to meet the growing payment needs of the nation.
