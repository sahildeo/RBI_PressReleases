RBI warning on phishing mail 
 
It has come to the notice of the Reserve Bank of India that an email has been 
sent in its name from mail id: alert@rbi.org and signed by RBI Online offering a 'new 
online security platform'. According to the mail, the 'new online security platform' 
offers to 'prevent online identity theft in internet banking by asking the customer to go 
through a two-way authentication factor before he/she properly logs into internet 
banking every time'. The email then asks the recipient to 'download the attachment 
and update'.  
 
The Reserve Bank clarifies that it has not sent any such mail. In fact, it does 
not have any mail ids with extension @rbi.org. Members of public receiving such 
mails should not open the attachment and/or try to download it on their computer. It 
could be a phishing mail and downloading the attachment could result in identity 
theft.
