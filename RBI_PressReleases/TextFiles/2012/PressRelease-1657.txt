RBI Releases Discussion Paper on Introduction of  
Dynamic Provisioning Framework for Banks in India 
   The Reserve Bank of India today released on its website discussion paper on 
Introduction of Dynamic Provisioning Framework for Banks in India for comments 
and feedback from the banks and the other stakeholders.  
 At present, banks generally make two types of provisions viz., general 
provisions on standard assets and specific provisions on non-performing assets 
(NPAs). Since the level of NPAs varies through the economic cycle, the resultant 
level of specific provisions also behaves cyclically. Consequently, lower provisioning 
during upturns, and higher provisioning during downturns have procyclical effect on 
the real economy.  
To address procyclicality of capital and provisioning, after the financial crisis, 
efforts at international level are being made to introduce countercyclical capital and 
provisioning buffers. Reserve Bank has accordingly prepared a discussion paper on 
countercyclical provisioning framework with parameters calibrated based on credit 
history of Indian banks.  
  To facilitate a structured response to various issues, the discussion paper lists 
specific ‘questions’ on relevant issues for comments. However, in addition to these 
questions, banks/stakeholders may also furnish comments/feedback on any other 
issue covered in the discussion paper. Comments may please be forwarded to the 
Chief General Manager-in-Charge, Department of Banking Operations and 
Development, Reserve Bank of India, Central Office Building, 12th Floor, S.B. Singh 
Marg, Mumbai-400001, latest by May 15, 2012 by email. 
Background 
 It may be recalled that in the Second Quarter Review of Monetary Policy 
2011-12 it was announced that Reserve Bank would issue a discussion paper by 
end-March 2012, on the dynamic provisioning approach for comments.
