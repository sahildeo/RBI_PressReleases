RBI implements Web-based Online Trading Module in  
G-Secs by Gilt Account Holders 
The Reserve Bank of India has introduced web-based NDS-OM module for 
online trading in secondary market of Government securities (G-Secs) by gilt 
account holders (GAHs). The module, which will facilitate buying and selling of G-
secs, is operational from June 29, 2012. The module permits internet-based direct 
participation of gilt account holders in secondary market for G-secs.  
As the web-based NDS-OM module is an additional facility to the existing 
system for trading by gilt account holders through Primary Members (PMs), existing 
regulations related to current constituent subsidiary general ledger (CSGL) account 
holders would remain. The access to the module, thus, will be subject to controls by 
respective PM as the PM would continue to be responsible for settlement of CSGL 
trades in respect of its gilt account holders, as is the case at present.  
All actions on web-based NDS-OM platform would also be governed by rules, 
regulations, notifications and/or any other instructions issued by the Reserve Bank 
from time to time. The Reserve Bank will have no role in any dispute between any 
GAH and its PM for any action performed on this platform by either GAH or its PM. 
Further details and operational guidelines on the web-based NDS-OM facility 
are available on Clearing Corporation of India Limited (CCIL) URL 
https://www.ccilindia.com/Documents/whats_new/2012/NDS_OM_Web_Module.pdf. 
Frequently asked questions (FAQs) on web-based NDS-OM along with the tutorial 
are available on the Reserve Bank’s website (www.rbi.org.in). For further 
clarifications participants can also contact NDS-OM Helpdesk at 022-61546354 or 
send a mail to giltshelpdesk@ccilindia.co.in.
