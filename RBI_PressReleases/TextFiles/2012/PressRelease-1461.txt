RBI takes measures to ease foreign currency flows  
 
On a review of developments in the global financial markets and current macro-
economic conditions, the Reserve Bank has taken the following measures to ease 
foreign currency flows as also to enhance the availability of export credit in foreign 
currency:   
 
• Interest rate ceiling on Foreign Currency Non-Resident [FCNR (B)] 
deposits of banks has been raised from 125 basis points (bps) above the 
corresponding LIBOR/Swap rates to 200 bps for maturity period of 1 year 
to less than 3 years, and to 300 bps for maturity period of 3 to 5 years. 
• The ceiling rate on export credit in foreign currency which was 
constraining the availability of credit to exporters in foreign currency has 
been deregulated by allowing banks to freely determine their interest rates 
on such credit.   
The above measures are aimed at augmenting foreign currency inflows to banks 
which in turn would facilitate their foreign currency loans to exporters. These measures 
will come into effect from May 5, 2012. The detailed guidelines are being issued 
separately.
