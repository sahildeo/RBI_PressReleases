RBI releases Minutes of Technical Advisory Committee on Monetary Policy 
 
                     
 The Reserve Bank of India today released on its website the minutes of its 
Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) on Monetary Policy.  
Since February 2011, the Reserve Bank has been placing the main points of 
discussions of the TAC on Monetary Policy meetings in the public domain with a 
lag of roughly four weeks after the meeting. 
Minutes 
 The twenty-ninth meeting of the Technical Advisory Committee on Monetary 
Policy (TAC) was held on July 25, 2012 in the run-up to the First Quarter Review of 
Monetary Policy 2012-13 on July 31, 2012. The main points of discussion in the 
meeting are set out below.  
1. Members were unified in their assessment of the global macroeconomic 
environment. They felt that the evolving global situation is much worse than 
it was at the beginning of the year. US growth is decelerating, the European 
crisis appears to be deepening, although Europe has shown commitment to 
the Union, and there is increasing evidence of China’s growth slowdown. 
They felt that global growth is likely to slow down further. With droughts in 
the US, Eurasia and Australia, global food stocks are likely to go down to all-
time lows, and global food inflation could be high. Although softening of oil 
prices has helped India and there is some evidence of improvement in oil

supplies, inflationary pressures could spill over to metal, oil and other 
commodities, if there is further quantitative easing in the US or Europe.   
2. On domestic macroeconomic concerns, Members felt that the current 
situation is by far the most difficult, in the last several years. Infrastructural 
bottlenecks in power, coal, and transport seem to have worsened, causing 
serious supply side pressures. With weaknesses in power and aviation 
sectors, public-private-partnership projects are getting impacted, which 
entails the risk of lowering private investment in infrastructure. The 
manufacturing sector is at a standstill, with not only the capital goods 
industry in a bad shape, but also the short-cycle consumer products 
registering a contraction. Due to weak monsoon, there could be a shortfall in 
the output of the agricultural sector. In sum, Members felt that there is 
growing evidence of slowdown of domestic growth. 
3. All Members felt that with the monsoon failure, food prices might go up 
significantly due to a substantial agricultural shortfall. One Member felt that 
the high food stocks could restrain upward pressure on foodgrain prices but 
another Member felt that  they might not be of much help because of part of 
the stocks not being of edible quality. Wage pressures remain significant, 
particularly in rural areas. Moreover, structural problems, such as those in 
proteins items, are keeping non-core inflation high. Additionally, inflation 
concerns stem from suppressed inflation and tightening supply bottlenecks 
in infrastructure. The economy is in a bind with slackening growth and 
elevated inflation, but the remedies, Members felt, lie with the Government.     
4. On the fiscal front, many Members apprehended that there could be a 
slippage in the fiscal deficit in 2012-13. According to some Members, diesel 
price revision to contain subsidies looks very difficult due to the looming 
drought situation. Members also felt that the twin deficits remain a serious 
concern for India.

5. Most Members observed that India’s external sector concerns had 
increased considerably. FDI has slowed down while the current account 
deficit (CAD) remains high, although there was some improvement in the 
last quarter as international oil prices and gold imports fell. Unless big-ticket 
FDI projects get clearance, the situation is unlikely to improve. Members, 
however, cautioned against excessive reliance on short-term foreign debt to 
finance the CAD.  
6. Members had divergent views on monetary policy and liquidity measures. Of 
the seven external Members, five suggested that the Reserve Bank should 
not change the policy rate. They felt that given the fiscal dominance, double-
digit consumer price inflation and no realistic expectation of credible action 
from the Government, the Reserve Bank needs to focus on tempering 
inflation expectations.  Of these five Members, one suggested that adequate 
liquidity should be available in the system to support growth for which either 
the cash reserve ratio (CRR) should be reduced by 25 basis points or the 
open market operations (OMOs) should be more active. Another Member 
was of the view that the CRR is already low and it might be preserved for a 
worse situation, but more aggressive OMOs could be used to improve 
reserve money growth and further ease the liquidity conditions.  
7. The remaining two of the seven external Members suggested that there 
could be a symbolic reduction in the policy rate by 25 basis points to 
stimulate investment. One of them also suggested a reduction in the CRR 
by 25 basis points.   
8. The meeting was chaired by Dr. D. Subbarao, Governor. Other internal 
Members present were: Dr. Subir Gokarn, Vice-Chairman, Deputy 
Governors, Dr. K.C. Chakrabarty, Shri Anand Sinha and Shri H.R. Khan; 
and external Members, Shri Y.H. Malegam, Dr. Rakesh Mohan, Prof. Indira
