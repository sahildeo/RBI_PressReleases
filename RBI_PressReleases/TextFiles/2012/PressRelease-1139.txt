Monetary Policy Transmission in India : A Peep Inside the Black Box 
The Reserve Bank of India today placed on its website a Working Paper titled 
“Monetary Policy Transmission in India : A Peep Inside the Black Box". The Working 
Paper has been written by Shri Jeevan Kumar Khundrakpam and Shri Rajeev Jain.  
Monetary policy transmission is a process through which monetary policy 
decisions affect the economy in general and the price level in particular. It is a 
complex process, wherein the transmission of policy actions to market interest rates 
and further to real sector may proceed through several channels. Therefore, 
monetary policy transmission mechanism is still considered to be a “black box”. In 
this context, this paper, using SVAR models on quarterly data for 1996-97:1 to 2011-
12:1, examines the relative importance of various transmission channels of monetary 
policy to output growth and inflation in India.  
The paper finds that external exogenous factors prolong the impact of 
monetary policy transmission on GDP growth and inflation in India, while removing 
the problem of ‘price puzzle’. Among the various channels of transmission, interest 
rate channel, credit channel and asset prices channel are found to be important, 
while exchange rate channel is weak. A positive shock to policy rate leads to 
slowdown in credit growth with a lag of two quarters and subsequently impacts GDP 
growth and inflation negatively. The same monetary policy shock has a negative 
impact on asset prices from the third quarter onwards and, in turn, has a pronounced 
negative impact on GDP growth and inflation. Exchange rate channel is found to 
have an insignificant impact on GDP growth, but has non-negligible impact on 
inflation.  Interest rate channel is found to account for about half of the total impact of 
monetary shocks on GDP growth and about one-third of the total impact on inflation, 
indicating that interest rate channel is the most important channel for monetary policy 
transmission in India.
