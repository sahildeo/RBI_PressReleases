RBI Committee recommends Risk Based  
Supervision for Commercial Banks 
Background 
 A High Level Steering Committee (HLSC) for Review of Supervisory 
Processes for Commercial Banks was constituted by the Governor, Reserve Bank of 
India on August 3, 2011. The HLSC was chaired by Dr. K.C. Chakrabarty, Deputy 
Governor. Members of the HLSC comprised Shri B. Mahapatra, Executive Director, 
Reserve Bank, Shri Basant Seth, Chairman and Managing Director (Rtd.), Syndicate 
Bank, Smt. Chanda Kochhar, Chief Executive Officer, ICICI Bank Ltd., Shri Diwakar 
Gupta, Managing Director and Chief Financial Officer, State Bank of India, Prof. J R 
Varma, Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, Shri M B N Rao, Chairman and 
Managing Director (Rtd.), Canara Bank  and Shri G. Jaganmohan Rao, Chief 
General Manager-in-Charge, Department of Banking Supervision (Member 
Secretary). 
 
 The HLSC was mandated to suggest measures for making the supervisory 
processes for commercial banks more effective and useful to the supervised entities 
as well. The terms of reference for the Committee included a mandate for reviewing 
the extant approach, methodology, processes/tools for onsite and off-site 
supervision, supervisory rating and stress testing frameworks and recommending 
measures for a gradual progression to a risk based supervision framework. The 
Committee has since submitted its Report to the Governor on June 11, 2012. 
 
 The Committee expects that the recommendations made in the report would 
transform the approach and processes for supervision of commercial banks in India 
thereby bringing them in line with the international best practices and standards and 
ensuring safety and stability of Indian banking system in the coming decade. 
 
Major Recommendations of the Committee 
 
Objectives of Supervision 
 An implicit overarching objective of RBI’s supervisory process should also be 
to ensure financial stability and customer protection, along with protection of 
depositors’ interests and ensuring the financial health of individual banks/FIs. (2.6.5 
& 2.6.6) 
 
Approach to Supervision - RBS  
 Risk Based Supervision (RBS) which focusses on evaluating both present 
and future risks, identifying incipient problems and facilitates prompt intervention/ 
early corrective action should replace the present compliance-based and 
transaction-testing approach (CAMELS) which is more in the nature of a point in time 
assessment. (2.6.27)

 Under RBS, the supervisory stance would be determined based on a 
supervisory analysis of Probability of failure of a bank and the likely Impact of its 
failure on the banking/financial system. Thus, the periodicity/intensity of on-site 
inspection of a bank would depend upon its position on the Risk-Impact Index Matrix 
rather than its volume of business. (3.7.9)  
 
 The success of RBS approach is highly incumbent upon a robust offsite 
surveillance system. In this regard, there is a need to eliminate any manual 
intervention in the flow of supervisory data from the banks to RBI and also ensure 
quality/integrity of data submitted.  (2.6.29 & 3.6.4) 
  
 The supervised entities would benefit from the flow of frequent information 
and feedback they receive from the assessment and supervision of risk areas 
identified by the supervisor. (3.7.5 & 4.23)   
 
Supervisory Rating under RBS 
  
 Under the proposed RBS, the supervisory rating would be a reflection on the 
risk elements (inherent business risks and effectiveness of control) and would not be 
an exercise in performance evaluation as under the CAMELS rating Framework.  
The supervisory rating exercise would aim at determining the overall probability of 
failure of the bank in light of risks to which the bank is exposed, strength of 
control/governance and oversight framework in place and available capital. Based on 
the exercise, the bank would be apprised of the direction/trend of key risk groups 
along with overall risk faced by it. Further, a risk mitigation plan, comprising of need 
for improving controls, augmenting capital and/or restructuring business would be 
given to the bank. (4.11, 4.12, 4.22 & 4.23) 
  
 The supervisory intervention including placing a bank under the Prompt 
Corrective Action (PCA) framework, if required, would be based on the supervisory 
rating and the risk-impact score of the bank. (3.7.11 & 4.23) 
 
Thematic Reviews 
  
           The supervisor would increasingly use thematic reviews as a tool of 
supervision whereby review of a particular product, market or practice using a 
specialized team would be made to assess risks brewing within the sector or at 
system level for enabling prompt actions/measures. (3.11.3)  
 
Consolidated Supervision 
  
 To facilitate effective consolidated supervision, the supervision of all group 
entities under the jurisdiction of RBI has to be brought under a single supervisory 
department as against the present fragmented set up for supervising different 
entities belonging to the same banking group. (2.6.15) 
 
Jurisdiction of supervision 
  
 The domains of regulation and supervision should be firmly demarcated and 
any entity-specific decision should only emanate from the supervisory department. 
This is necessary for clarity of jurisdiction for the supervised entity and for making 
the ‘Supervisory Relationship Manager’ an effective single point of contact in the 
Department of Banking Supervision. The communication between the supervisor and 
the supervised entity is confidential and, therefore, should not be subject to any 
public scrutiny. (2.6.19) 3 
 
 
Single Point of Supervisory Contact  
  
 A single point interface within RBI in the form of a Supervisory Relationship 
Manager (SRM) for each bank within the supervisory department would ensure 
efficient and effective communication between the supervisor and the supervised 
entity (2.6.18 & 6.7.5) 
 
Building of Supervisory Skills 
 In view of the need to improve skill sets of supervisors in the RBI and creating 
a knowledge pool of specialists with legal, banking, audit etc. backgrounds, training 
in specified areas, lateral induction of specialists and a system of continuous 
movement of people from RBI to external organizations and vice versa may be 
considered to augment supervisory resources of the RBI. (6.8.7)
