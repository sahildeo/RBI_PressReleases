RBI Working Paper Series 16 / 2012 
India’s Sustainable CAD Level  
The sustainable level of India’s Current Account Deficit (CAD) would be in the 
range of 2.4 to 2.8 per cent of GDP over the medium term. This will be on the 
assumptions that GDP growth ranges between 6.0 and 8.0 per cent, inflation is 
around 5.0 per cent and interest rate and size of capital flows broadly follow their 
trends in the recent past. This was the major finding of a working paper published on 
the Reserve Bank website today. The Working Paper titled ‘Sustainable Level of 
India’s Current Account Deficit’ has been authored by Shri Rajan Goyal. 
The paper argues that excessive current account deficit (CAD) tends to make 
an economy vulnerable to external debt or currency crisis which in turn leads to 
financial instability and causes substantial output and welfare losses. The paper 
observes that in the Indian context, although CAD averaging around 2.7 per cent of 
GDP during 2008-09 to 2010-11 did not cause any stress on the economy, CAD 
exceeding 4.0 per cent of GDP caused net drawdown of reserves of US$ 12.8 billion 
in  2011-12. Noting that the sustainable level of CAD in India is historically believed 
to be below 2 per cent of GDP, the paper examines whether this level has moved up 
and if so what is the likely sustainable level of CAD in the current scenario.  
The paper then goes on to estimate sustainable level of CAD for India by 
applying a statistical model to the threshold level of net external liabilities that the 
economy should not breach to ensure stability of the external sector. Probit analysis 
based on a panel of select economies has also been used to arrive at the threshold 
level.
