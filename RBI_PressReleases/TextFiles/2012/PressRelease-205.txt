RBI sets up Technical Committee to review Presentation of its Accounts  
 
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has constituted a Technical Committee to 
review the form of presentation of its Balance Sheet and Profit and Loss Account. The 
Committee will also review the style and content of the management commentaries on 
financial statements and notes to the accounts, and make recommendations to effect 
changes, if necessary, by appropriate legislative/regulatory modifications.  
 
Several changes have been brought about over the years in the presentation and 
the explanatory notes to RBI accounts with a view to improving the disclosure, 
transparency and information content. The existing format of the Balance Sheet and 
Profit and Loss Account is being reviewed in order to keep pace with the changing times 
and meet the market expectations for bringing in more clarity and lucidity for the wider 
readership, while aligning with the best international practices.  
 
The terms of reference, in brief, of the Committee are: 
 
i) Whether the existing presentation of two separate Balance Sheets of Issue and 
Banking Departments needs to be merged into a single Balance Sheet of the RBI;  
 
ii) Whether it is necessary to have separate Profit and Loss Accounts for the Issue 
and Banking Departments or whether the present form of a combined Profit and Loss 
Account will continue; 
 
iii) Whether the disclosures presently made in the Balance Sheet and Profit and 
Loss Account and the notes to accounts are adequate or can be elaborated/ improved. 
 
The Committee will comprise Shri Y. H. Malegam, Director on the Central Board 
of the RBI as Chairman. Ms Indira Rajaraman, Director on the Central Board of the RBI, 
Shri B. Mahapatra, Executive Director, RBI, Shri P. R. Ramesh, Chairman, Deloitte 
Haskins and Sells, and Shri V. Venkataramanan, Partner, KPMG, are the other 
Members. Shri S. Ganeshkumar, Chief General Manager, Department of Government 
and Bank Accounts, RBI is the Member-Secretary.
