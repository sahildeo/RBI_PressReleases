RBI announces Further Liberalisation Measures  
for Capital Account Transactions  
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), in consultation with the Government of India 
has decided to introduce the following measures with immediate effect: 
It has been decided to allow Indian companies in manufacturing and 
infrastructure sector and having foreign exchange earnings to avail of external 
commercial borrowing (ECB) for repayment of outstanding Rupee loans towards 
capital expenditure and/or fresh Rupee capital expenditure under the approval route. 
The overall ceiling for such ECBs would be USD 10 billion.  
The existing limit for investment by Securities and Exchange Board of India 
(SEBI) registered foreign institutional investors (FIIs) in Government securities (G-
Secs) has been enhanced by a further amount of USD 5 billion. This would take the 
overall limit for FII investment in G-Secs from USD 15 billion to USD 20 billion. In 
order to broad base the non-resident investor base for G-Secs, it has also been 
decided to allow long term investors like Sovereign Wealth Funds (SWFs), 
multilateral agencies, endowment funds, insurance funds, pension funds and foreign 
central banks to be registered with SEBI, to also invest in G-Secs for the entire limit 
of USD 20 billion. The sub-limit of USD 10 billion (existing USD 5 billion with residual 
maturity of 5 years and additional limit of USD 5 billion) would have the residual 
maturity of three years.   
The terms and conditions for the scheme for FII investment in infrastructure 
debt and the scheme for non-resident investment in Infrastructure Development 
Funds (IDFs) have been further rationalised in terms of lock-in period and residual 
maturity.  
Further, Qualified Foreign Investors (QFIs) can now invest in those mutual 
fund (MF) schemes that hold at least 25 per cent of their assets (either in debt or in 
equity or both) in infrastructure sector under the current USD 3 billion sub-limit for 
investment in mutual funds related to infrastructure.  
The operational/ regulatory guidelines for the above measures under Foreign 
Exchange Management Act (FEMA), 1999 are being issued separately.
