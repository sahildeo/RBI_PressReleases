RBI Working Paper Series 13 / 2012 
Fiscal Stance, Credibility and Inflation Persistence in India  
The Reserve Bank of India today placed on its website a Working Paper titled 
"Fiscal Stance, Credibility and Inflation Persistence in India." The Working Paper has 
been written by Shri Pankaj Kumar and Shri Pratik Mitra. 
In the recent past, India has experienced high and persistent inflation. In 
response, the Reserve Bank of India cumulatively raised the cash reserve ratio by 
100 basis points and the policy rate (repo rate) by 375 basis points between January 
2010 and October 2011. Despite these policy actions, the inflation rate however 
continues to remain stubbornly high. The authors  examine the reasons for  our 
current inflation predicament.  
The paper finds that large contemporary government deficits unaccompanied 
by concrete prospects for future government surpluses promote realistic doubts 
about whether monetary restraint must be abandoned sooner or later to help finance 
the deficit. The result will be a rise in inflationary expectations in spite of current 
money-supply restraint - a bout of unpleasant monetarist arithmetic. 
The policy implications of this paper are quite clear. Prudent anti-inflation 
policy includes containment of the deficit. It is insufficient to announce and maintain 
restrictive monetary policies unless accompanied by a coordinated reduction in the 
budget deficits. 
The Reserve Bank of India introduced the RBI Working Papers series in 
March 2011. These papers present research in progress of the staff members of RBI 
and are disseminated to elicit comments and further debate. The views expressed in 
these papers are those of authors and not that of the Reserve Bank of India. 
Comments and observations may kindly be forwarded to authors. Citation and use of 
such papers should take into account its provisional character.
