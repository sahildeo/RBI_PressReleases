Indicative Calendar for Articles in RBI Bulletin:
RBI’s One More Step towards Transparency
The January 2013 Bulletin will release an advance indicative calendar of articles to
be published during the course of the calendar year 2013. The Bulletin articles will also be
more focussed and analytical, putting forth the views of the Reserve Bank’s research staff
on varied issues. This would contribute further towards enhancing transparency. The size
of the weekly Statistical Supplement will get reduced to a 4-page statement from the
current 8-page with a view to making it crisp and analytically more informative.
It has always been the endeavour of the Reserve Bank to disseminate the
information in a timely manner as widely as possible.  In this pursuit, the Reserve Bank of
India Monthly Bulletin and the Weekly Statistical Supplement (WSS) have a long and
chequered history.  While the Bulletin made its first appearance in January 1947, the
weekly statement preceded the Bulletin providing, among others, the weekly statement of
affairs of the Reserve Bank of the preceding Friday. With the passage of time, both these
publications have undergone major changes in substance and form in tune with time and
state of the economy.
One of the most sweeping changes in recent period has been the increasing use of
electronic media, such as, the website and CDs, for dissemination of information.  Market
participants and other stake-holders in fact, look forward to the real-time dissemination of
policies, analysis and data.
Against this backdrop, the Reserve Bank had recently undertaken a review of the
Monthly Bulletin and the WSS. Accordingly, various changes are being made starting from
January 2013 for timely dissemination of information consistent with international best
practice. The Bulletin will continue to publish policy initiatives including monetary policy
statements and their reviews, Macroeconomic and Monetary Developments, information
on market operations and speeches of the Top Executives of the Reserve Bank. It will
also continue to release as supplements, the flagship publications of the Reserve Bank
viz., Annual Report, Report on Trend and Progress of Banking in India and Financial
Stability Report.
The “Current Statistics” part of the Bulletin will continue to offer the latest snapshot
of the Indian economy, focussing on the financial sector and the primary data originating
from the Reserve Bank; and the long time series will continue to be available on-line on
the Reserve Bank’s Database of the Indian Economy at http://dbie.rbi.org.in. The “Current
Statistics” will also include additional tables on sectoral deployment of credit, new
consumer price index, turnover in select financial markets, payment system indicators,
external commercial borrowings and international investment position for wider
dissemination of critical information on the economy.
Comments and suggestions on the restructured Bulletin and WSS are welcome
and may please be forwarded by email or by post to the Director, Division of Reports and
Knowledge Dissemination, Department of Economic Policy and Research, Reserve Bank
of India, Central Office, Fort, Mumbai 400 001.
