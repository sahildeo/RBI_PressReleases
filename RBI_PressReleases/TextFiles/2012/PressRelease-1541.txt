RBI Working Paper Series: 
Asset Pricing Model for Inefficient Markets:  
Empirical Evidence from Indian Market 
The Reserve Bank of India today placed on its website a Working Paper for 
the month of April 2012 titled “Asset Pricing Model for Inefficient Markets: empirical 
evidence from the Indian market”. The Working Paper has been written by              
Dr. Debasish Majumder. 
The paper provides a direction for incorporating market sentiments in the 
domain of standard models of asset pricing. The market sentiment is unobservable. 
However, it can be defined as the stationary departure of the market return from its 
fair value. This part of the market return is explained by the exuberance or 
pessimism by investors to certain information. Any autocorrelation that is observed in 
the market return might be the result of possible bullish/bearish responses by 
investors to market information. 
Often, Indian equity market returns are serially correlated for at least one lag. 
Unfortunately, ‘mispricing’ might be a common outcome of application of any familiar 
asset pricing models for these markets because these models ignore the qualitative 
aspects of human decision making. To widen the applicability of these models 
ranging from an efficient to an inefficient market, the author proposed a 
transformation through which the original market would be transformed to a 
hypothetical market which is relatively efficient. The empirical study for Indian 
markets reveals that hypothetical market returns are, in general, not serially 
dependent and so meet the prerequisites of applying a standard asset-pricing model. 
Any conventional bond or stock pricing model could, therefore, be efficiently 
manipulated for those returns. The model is applicable for a ‘less than’ efficient 
market and, therefore, may be a useful addition in investors’ toolkits.
