Mid-Quarter Monetary Policy Review: March 2012 
Monetary and Liquidity Measures 
On the basis of the current macroeconomic assessment, it has been 
decided to: 
• keep the cash reserve ratio (CRR) of scheduled banks unchanged at 
4.75 per cent of their net demand and time liabilities; and  
• keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) 
unchanged at 8.5 per cent. 
  Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF will remain 
unchanged at 7.5 per cent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and 
the Bank Rate at 9.5 per cent. 
Introduction  
2. The Reserve Bank reduced the CRR by 75 basis points from 5.5 per 
cent to 4.75 per cent effective March 10, 2012. This measure was necessitated 
ahead of this scheduled Mid-Quarter Review to address the persistent 
structural liquidity deficit beyond the Reserve Bank’s comfort level, which would 
have further worsened during the week of March 12-16 due to advance tax 
outflows.  
Global Economy  
3. Since the Reserve Bank ’s Third Quarter Review (TQR) of January 24, 
2012, there has been modest improvement in the global macroeconomic 
situation. The recent macroeconomic data for the US economy show some 
positive signs. In particular, labour market conditions have improved. However, 
1 
 
?null???????null?????the US Fed expects that economic conditions warrant exceptionally low levels 
for the federal funds rate at least through late 2014.  
4. The immediate financial market pressures in the euro area have been 
alleviated to some extent by the European Central Bank (ECB) injecting 
liquidity of more than one trillion euro through the two long-term refinancing 
operations.  Growth in the euro area, however, turned negative in Q4. The 
emerging and developing economies (EDEs) are showing signs of growth 
slowdown. As a result, the global growth for 2012 and 2013 is expected to be 
lower than earlier anticipated.  
5. Inflation pressures in both advanced economies and EDEs moderated 
towards the end of 2011 on account of subdued domestic demand and 
correction in non-fuel commodity prices. Global crude prices, however, have 
spiked suddenly reflecting both geo-political concerns and abundant global 
liquidity, accentuating the risks to growth and inflation.  
Domestic economy  
Growth 
6. GDP growth [year-on-year (y-o-y)] decelerated to 6.1 per cent in Q3 of 
2011-12 from 6.9 per cent in Q2 mainly reflecting a slowdown in industrial 
activity. On the expenditure side, the growth moderation was mainly due to a 
deceleration in investment activity and weak external demand. The Central 
Statistics Office (CSO) has estimated the full year growth for 2011-12 at 6.9 
per cent, which is in line with the Reserve Bank ’s projection.   
7. Growth in industrial production, as reflected in the index of industrial 
production (IIP), moderated to 4.0 per cent during 2011-12 (April-January) from 
8.3 per cent in the corresponding period a year ago. While growth in the capital 
goods and intermediate goods sectors was negative, growth in the basic goods 
and consumer goods sectors decelerated marginally. Given the significant 
volatility in IIP numbers, the Reserve Bank also uses several other indicators to 
assess the overall industrial activity. The Manufacturing PMI for February 
suggested that industrial activity remained in an expansionary mode. While 
corporate sales growth in Q3 of 2011-12 was robust, margins moderated, 
reflecting increasing difficulty in passing on rising input prices.

      Inflation 
8. After remaining above 9 per cent during April-November 2011, y-o-y 
headline wholesale price index (WPI) inflation rate moderated to 7.7 per cent in 
December and further to 6.6 per cent in January 2012, before rising to 7.0 per 
cent in February. While moderation in WPI inflation stemmed mainly from 
primary food articles, fuel and manufactured products groups also contributed.  
9. Primary food articles inflation, which was modest at 0.8 per cent in 
December, turned negative (-0.5 per cent) in January 2012, before rising to 6.1 
per cent in February. Despite the sharp increase in global crude oil prices, fuel 
group inflation moderated from 15.0 per cent in December to 12.8 per cent in 
February, reflecting the absence of commensurate pass-through to domestic 
consumers.  
10. Non-food manufactured products inflation moderated from 7.9 per cent 
in December to 5.8 per cent in February 2012, reflecting both a slowdown in 
domestic demand following the monetary tightening and moderation in global 
non-oil commodity prices. The momentum indicator of non-food manufactured 
products inflation (seasonally adjusted 3-month moving average inflation rate) 
also showed a moderating trend.  
11. Notably, Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation (as measured by the 
new series, base year 2010) for the month of January 2012 was 7.7 per cent 
suggesting that price pressures persist at the retail level. 
Fiscal Situation 
12. The Centre ’s fiscal conditions deteriorated during 2011-12 (April-
January) with key deficit indicators already crossing the budget estimates for 
the full year. Apart from sluggishness in tax revenues, Government ’s non-plan 
expenditure, particularly subsidies, increased sharply.  As indicated in the 
TQR, the slippage in the fiscal deficit has been adding to inflationary pressures. 
Credible fiscal consolidation, therefore, will be an important factor in shaping 
the inflation outlook.  
Money, Credit and Liquidity Conditions  
3 
 13. The y-o-y money supply (M ) growth and non-food credit growth 
3
moderated, reflecting the slowdown in the economy. Liquidity conditions have 
remained significantly in deficit mode.  In order to mitigate the liquidity 
tightness, the Reserve Bank undertook steps to inject primary liquidity of a 
more durable nature through open market operations (OMOs) aggregating 
`1,247 billion during November 2011- March 9, 2012 and reduced the CRR by 
125 basis points (50 basis points effective January 28 and 75 basis points 
effective March 10), injecting primary liquidity of about `800 billion. The liquidity 
situation has since improved and it is expected to ease further in the weeks 
ahead. 
External sector  
14. While merchandise exports growth decelerated, moderation in imports 
growth was less pronounced leading to a widening of the trade deficit. After the 
TQR, the rupee has moved in a range of `48.69 to `50.58 per USD. With 
sluggish demand conditions in the advanced economies impeding exports 
growth and  crude oil prices rising sharply, the current account deficit (CAD) is 
likely to remain high. The financing of the CAD will continue to pose a 
challenge so long as the global situation remains uncertain. 
Outlook  
15. While the recovery in the US has been progressing, economic activity 
in the euro area has contracted.  Although abundant liquidity injection by the 
ECB has mitigated the immediate pressures in financial markets, a credible 
solution to the sovereign debt problem is yet to emerge. Sluggish global 
economic activity, uncertainty in the euro area and rising crude oil prices will 
hamper growth prospects of EDEs.   
16. On the domestic front, while most indicators suggest that the economy 
is slowing down, the performance in Q4 of 2011-12 is expected to be better 
than that in Q3. Inflation has broadly evolved along the projected trajectory so 
far. However, upside risks to inflation have increased from the recent surge in 
crude oil prices, fiscal slippage and rupee depreciation. Besides, there 
continues to be significant suppressed inflation in fuel, fertilizer and power as   
administered prices do not fully reflect the costs of production.

 Guidance 
17. Recent growth-inflation dynamics have prompted the Reserve Bank to 
indicate that no further tightening is required and that future actions will be 
towards lowering the rates. However, notwithstanding the deceleration in 
growth, inflation risks remain, which will influence both the timing and 
magnitude of future rate actions.
