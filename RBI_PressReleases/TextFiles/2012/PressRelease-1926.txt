Highlights:   
 1. Developments in India's Balance of Payments during Second Quarter (July-
September) of 2011-12 
 The article provides details on developments in India's balance of 
payments during July-September 2011(Q2). The disaggregated data on invisibles for 
the Q2 of 2011-12 along with quarterly data for 2009-10 and 2010-11 and Q1 data 
for 2011-12 have also been published as part of this article. 
Main Findings
• During Q2 of 2011-12, a rise in trade deficit, despite sharper increase in 
exports than imports and increase in net export of services, led to a marginal 
increase in the current account deficit (CAD) as compared with Q2 of the 
previous year. 
• On a BoP basis, merchandise exports recorded a growth of 47.2 per cent while 
imports registered a growth of 35.4 per cent leading to a higher trade deficit of 
US$ 43.9 billion during Q2 of 2011-12 as compared to US$ 37.0 billion during 
corresponding quarter of preceding year.

• Rise in services receipts coupled with a decline in services payments resulted 
in  rise in net services exports to US$ 15.7 during the quarter from US$ 11.9 
billion in corresponding quarter of preceding year.  
• Net inflows under secondary income were partly offseted by net outflows on 
account of primary income.  The CAD was US$ 16.9 billion in Q2 of 2011-12.  
• The financial account surplus moderated in Q2 of 2011-12 as compared to Q2 
of 2010-11 primarily on account of outflow of portfolio investment.  
• There was an accretion to foreign exchange reserves (US$ 0.3 billion) during 
Q2 of 2011-12 (excluding valuation). 
• During April-September 2011, the CAD, in absolute terms, was higher than the 
corresponding period of the previous year mainly on account of increase in 
trade deficit, though net receipts on account of services and secondary income 
experienced robust growth. However, as a percentage of GDP, CAD was 
marginally lower than the first half of preceding year.  
• Despite improvement in the financial account surplus, accretion to reserves 
during April-September 2011 was lower mainly due to the widening of the CAD 
as compared to April-September 2010. 
2. Survey of India's Foreign Liabilities & Assets for the Mutual Fund 
Companies (2010-11)
The article presents an overview of the foreign assets and liabilities of mutual 
fund companies (MFs) in India based on the information collected by the Reserve 
Bank for the reference period March 2009 to March 2011. The results cover the 
responses from 44 MFs for March 2011 which held/acquired foreign assets or 
liabilities and 38 of them were common during the entire survey period. The study 
analyses in detail the changes in foreign assets and foreign liabilities of MFs during 
this period and country-wise classification of the foreign assets and liabilities has 
also been made.  
Main Findings:
• The global financial crisis induced considerable volatility in foreign assets and 
liabilities of the Indian mutual funds and asset management companies during 
2009-11. 
• Foreign liabilities of MFs in March 2011 were lower than the March 2009 level 
whereas their foreign assets increased during this period, on a net basis.  
• Foreign liabilities of MFs were estimated to be nearly five times the foreign 
assets of MFs in March 2011. Foreign liabilities of Asset Management 
Companies (AMCs) associated with the MFs also far exceeded their foreign 
assets.  
• Foreign assets of MFs were overwhelmingly on account of equity investment, 
overseas mutual fund units had a small share and no MF invested in debt 
securities abroad.  3 
 
3. Finances of Non-Government Non-Financial Large Public Limited 
Companies: 2010-11 
The article presents the financial performance of select 2,072 non-
government non-financial large (with paid-up capital of ` 10million or more) public 
limited companies during the financial year 2010-11, based on their audited annual 
accounts.  
Main Findings 
• The aggregate results of the select companies have shown that the growth 
rates in major parameters like sales, value of production, manufacturing 
expenses etc. improved in 2010-11 as compared with those in 2009-10.  
• However, growth in various measures of profit, viz., PBDIT, gross profits 
(PBIT) and profits after tax was moderated in 2010-11 after recording high 
growth in 2009-10 mainly on account of relatively higher growth in expenses 
than in sales.  
• The profitability and profit allocation ratios e.g. profit margin, return on equity 
contracted in 2010-11 compared with that in 2009-10.  
• Total outstanding borrowing grew at higher rate in the study year than in the 
previous year leading to higher growth in interest payments. Outstanding 
borrowing from banks also displayed increase at higher rate in 2010-11 
compared with that in 2009-10.  
• The debt to equity ratio (debt as percentage of equity) declined gradually in 
the three year study period from 2008-09 to 2010-11. 
• The share of external sources of funds (i.e. other than own sources) to total 
sources of funds during the year sharply increased mainly due to significant 
increase in incremental borrowing during 2010-11.Capital formation in uses of 
funds in 2010-11 was lower than in 2009-10. 
4. Quarterly Industrial Outlook Survey: October-December 2011 (Round 56) 
              The article presents the findings of Industrial Outlook Survey conducted for 
the October-December 2011 quarter, the 56th round in the series. It gives an 
assessment of business situation of companies in manufacturing sector, for the 
quarter October-December 2011, and their expectations for the ensuing quarter 
January-March 2012. 
Main Findings 
• The survey results signal slight moderation in most of the parameters 
reflecting demand condition in the Indian Manufacturing sector for 
assessment quarter as well as expectation quarter.  Financial condition 
showed lower optimism in both the quarters. Net response on Availability of 
finance further declined while pessimism on cost of finance and cost of raw 
material continued.  
• The Business Expectation Index, a measure that gives a single snapshot of 
the industrial outlook in each study quarter, marginally increased to 110.1 
from 109.4 for assessment quarter and declined to 117.2 from 118.8 for 
expectation quarter; however, it still remains well above 100, the threshold 
that separates contraction from expansion.

5.  Quarterly Order Books, Inventories and Capacity Utilisation Survey: July-
September 2011 (Round 15) 
           The article, second in the series, presents the survey findings of the 15th 
round of the Order Books, Inventories and Capacity Utilisation Survey. The survey 
was conducted for the July-September 2011 quarter (Q2:2011-12) and captures the 
quarterly movements in order books, inventories and capacity utilisation of a targeted 
group of manufacturing companies, which are important indicators of economic 
activities, inflationary pressures and overall business cycle and as such, are useful in 
assessing the consumption and investment demand outlook. 
Main Findings 
• The survey results indicate continued growth(y-o-y) in the new orders with 
steady level of capacity utilisation.  The finished goods inventories to sales 
ratio remained at an elevated level whereas raw material inventories to sales 
ratio declined as compared with the previous quarter. 
 
6. Inflation Expectations Survey of Households: December 2011 (Round 26)  
th
        The findings of 26 round of Inflation Expectations Survey of Households 
conducted in the October-December 2011 quarter are presented in the article. The 
survey captures the inflation expectations of 4,000 urban households across 12 cities 
for the next three-month and for the next one-year. These expectations are based on 
their individual consumption baskets and hence should not be considered as 
predictors of any official measure of inflation. The households’ inflation expectations 
provide useful directional information on near-term inflationary pressures and also 
supplement other economic indicators to get an indication of future inflation path. The 
survey results are those of the respondents and not necessarily shared by the 
Reserve Bank of India. 
Main Findings 
• Households expect inflation to rise further by 50 and 140 basis points during 
next three-month and next one-year respectively from the perceived current 
rate of 11.9 per cent. 
• The percentage of respondents expecting an increase in general prices by 
‘more than the current rate’ for three-month ahead has gone down to 73.4 per 
cent from 75.8 per cent in the previous round (July-September 2011). The 
proportion that expect prices to rise by ‘more than the current rate’ in next one 
year has in contrast, increased to 76.9 per cent from 73.5 per cent in the 
previous round.  
• As compared with the last round, more respondents expect rise in prices at 
‘less than the current rate’, particularly in respect of housing prices and cost of 
services. 
• The extent of association of three-month ahead general price expectations 
with that of household durables and cost of services has decreased in the 
current survey round in comparison with those in the previous round.  
• As in the past rounds, daily-wage workers and housewives expect higher 
inflation rates compared to other categories. Across the cities, households in 
Bengaluru and Jaipur expect the highest inflation while expectations were the 
lowest for households in Ahmedabad. 
• On the feedback on RBI action to control inflation, the survey finds that 68 per 
cent of the respondents are aware of RBI action to control inflation.  5 
 
7. Consumer Confidence Survey: December 2011  
The article presents the salient findings of the Consumer Confidence Survey 
conducted in December 2011, the 7th round in the series. The survey covers 5272 
households spread over six metro cities. The survey captures the households’ 
confidence in the current and expected economic conditions, household 
circumstances, employment conditions, current and future spending and prices 
based on their perceptions of the general economic and own financial situation.  The 
survey results reflect perceptions of the respondents and not of the Reserve Bank of 
India. 
 
Main Findings 
• The survey indicates improvement in the positive perceptions in current and 
future economic conditions. Sentiments on ‘household circumstances’ have 
stayed positive, with one fourth of respondents still expecting a weakening.   
• Majority of the respondents reported increase in income in last one year, 
though their proportion has shown a decline over the quarters.  
• Sentiments on increased future spending, though net positive, have shown a 
decline over the last three quarters.   
• More than half of the respondents reported optimistic perceptions about the 
employment scenario in the economy.  
• Overall consumer confidence appears to have improved marginally, both for 
current and future periods.
