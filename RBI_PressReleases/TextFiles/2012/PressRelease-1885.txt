The Reserve Bank had constituted the Committee under the chairmanship of Shri. M. V. 
Nair on August 25, 2011 pursuant to the announcement made in the Monetary Policy Statement 
2011-12. The Committee was to re-examine the existing classification and suggest revised

Members from diverse fields and Dr. Deepali Pant Joshi, CGM-in-Charge, Rural Planning and 
Credit Department, Reserve Bank of India was its Member Secretary. The Committee was 
given a broad-based terms of reference.  
 
Major Recommendations of the Committee are: 
 
By adopting a wide and exhaustive consultation process, the Committee identified key 
issues facing diverse segments and sections of society; examined them thoroughly and made 
recommendations that would support achieving the objectives of directed lending.  
 
1. The target of domestic scheduled commercial banks for lending to priority sector may be 
retained at 40 per cent of adjusted net bank credit (ANBC) or credit equivalent of off-
balance sheet exposure (CEOBE), whichever is higher. 
 
2. The sector ‘agriculture and allied activities’ may be a composite sector within priority 
sector, by doing away with distinction between direct and indirect agriculture. The targets 
for agriculture and allied activities may be 18 per cent of ANBC or CEOBE, whichever is 
higher. 
3. A sub target for small and marginal farmers within agriculture and allied activities is 
recommended, equivalent to 9 per cent of ANBC or CEOBE, whichever is higher to be 
achieved in stages by 2015-16.

4. The MSE sector may continue to be under priority sector. Within MSE sector, a sub 
target for micro enterprises is recommended equivalent to 7 per cent of ANBC or 
CEOBE, whichever is higher, to be achieved in stages by 2013-14. 
 
5. Banks may be encouraged to ensure that the number of outstanding beneficiary 
accounts under ‘small and marginal farmers’ and micro enterprises’ each register a 
minimum annual growth rate of 15 per cent. 
 
6. The loans to housing and education may continue to be under priority sector. Loans for 
construction/purchase of one dwelling unit per individual up to Rs.25 lakh; loans up to 
Rs.2 lakh in rural and semi urban areas and up to Rs.5 lakh in other centres for repair of 
damaged dwelling units may be granted under priority sector. 
 
7. In order to encourage construction of dwelling units for Economically Weaker Sections 
(EWS) and Low Income Groups (LIG), housing loans granted to these individuals may 
be included in Weaker Sections Category.  
 
8. All loans to women under priority sector may also be counted under loans to weaker 
sections. 
 
9. Limit under priority sector for loans for studies in India may be increased to Rs. 15 lakh 
and Rs. 25 lakh in case of studies abroad, from existing limit of Rs 10 lakh and Rs 20 
lakh, respectively. 
 
10. The priority sector target for foreign banks may be increased to 40 per cent of ANBC or 
CEOBE, whichever is higher with sub-targets of 15 per cent for exports and 15 per cent 
for MSE sector, within which 7 per cent may be earmarked for micro enterprises. 
 
11. The committee recommends allowing non-tradable priority sector lending certificates 
(PSLCs) on pilot basis with domestic scheduled commercial banks, foreign banks and 
regional rural banks as market players.  
 
12. Bank loans to non-bank financial intermediaries for on-lending to specified segments 
may be allowed to be reckoned for classification under priority sector, up to a maximum 
of 5 per cent of ANBC or CEOBE, whichever is higher, subject to certain due diligence 
and documentation standards. 
 
13. The present system of report-based reporting has certain limitations and it may be 
improved through data-based reporting. There is a need to address the issues in data 
reporting like pre-defined parameters, reference date, periodicity, unit of reporting, etc. 
 
The recommendations of the Committee are expected to have significant impact in 
addressing issue of directing lending to those who have lack of access to credit and to those 
sectors which generate large employment. It is hoped that these recommendations would 
promote country’s developmental and inclusive goals.
