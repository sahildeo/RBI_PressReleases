Complain to Local Police/Cyber Crime Authorities  
against Fictitious Offers of Money from Abroad 
The Reserve Bank of India has today advised members of public to 
immediately register a complaint with the local police/cyber crime authorities when 
they receive fictitious offers of money from abroad or if they are victims of such 
offers. It has also placed, on its website, the list of such nodal agencies with whom 
the public can register complaints.   
The Reserve Bank has, on several occasions in the past, cautioned the 
members of public against falling prey to fictitious offers/lottery winnings/remittance 
of cheap funds in foreign currency from abroad by so-called foreign entities/ 
individuals or to Indian residents acting as representatives of such 
entities/individuals. It has stated that such offers are fraudulent and has advised the 
public to immediately register a complaint with the local police/cyber crime 
authorities when they receive such offers or become a victim of any such fraud.  
Members of public have also been cautioned against making any remittance 
towards participation in such schemes/offers from unknown entities since such 
remittances are illegal and any resident in India collecting and effecting/remitting 
such payments directly/indirectly outside India is liable to be proceeded against for 
contravention of the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999. They are also liable 
for violation of regulations relating to Know Your Customer (KYC) norms/Anti Money 
Laundering (AML) standards.  
The Reserve Bank has further stated that it does not undertake any type of 
money arrangement, by whatever name called, and it does not take any 
responsibility for recovering moneys remitted in response to such bogus 
communication.
