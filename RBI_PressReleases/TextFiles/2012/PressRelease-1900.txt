Minutes of the January 18, 2012 Meeting of the  
Technical Advisory Committee on Monetary Policy  
                     
The twenty-seventh meeting of the Committee was held on January 18, 2012 in the 
run up to the Third Quarter Review of the Monetary Policy 2011-12 on January 24, 
2012. The main points of discussion of this meeting are set out below.   
 
1. The TAC members reviewed the recent global and domestic macroeconomic 
developments. Most members felt that the macroeconomic situation in the 
euro area continued to be extremely worrisome. The probability of an event 
shock was still very high. They also felt that the growth in euro area could 
contract.  However, some other members felt that the global situation had 
improved and was better than in end-2011. Some members also noted the 
improving recovery in the US.  
 
2. Discussing the domestic macroeconomic situation, members felt that the 
economy was clearly slowing down.  They, in particular, expressed worry at 
the sharp slowdown of investment activity.  While high interest rates had 
impacted investment, the overall investment sentiment was also subdued 
because of the structural and confidence issues that had not been addressed. 
Some members felt that the slowdown in investment would affect the next 
year ’s growth as well. Besides, it would also have implications for inflation, 
going forward.  Some members, therefore, suggested that the policy focus 
should change from managing inflation to managing slowdown in investment. 
Most members felt that the current account deficit was high and widening due 
to slowdown in exports, but inelastic imports. Given the fragility of the global 
situation and slowdown in capital flows, there was a need to remain extremely 
watchful insofar as the external sector was concerned.  Almost all the 
members expressed satisfaction the way the Reserve Bank handled the 
rupee exchange rate. 
 
3. Members noted the moderation in domestic inflation, albeit driven largely by 
food prices. Some members felt that food price inflation would remain 
moderate which would soften aggregate inflation. They also noted that global 
commodity prices were softening. All these should help moderate inflation 
expectations. Some other members, however, continued to be concerned with 
high inflation and felt that it was persistent. According to them, although 
inflation would moderate to around 7 per cent by March 2012, it was nowhere 
near the 4.5 - 5.0 per cent mark. Most members felt that inflation would 
continue at the current levels in the near future because of the structural 
issues such as fiscal slippage, suppressed elements of inflation, increase in 
input prices due to  the weakening rupee, high inflation expectations and the 
??nullnull???nullnullnull??2 
 
wage-price spiral. Some members felt that level of inflation expectations was 
high and the Reserve Bank should continue to keep monetary policy tight (at 
the present level). It was necessary to bring down inflation significantly from 
the present level even if it meant lower growth for the next few years. It would 
ensure that high growth was achieved in subsequent years. 
 
4. All the members of Committee expressed serious concerns over the evolving 
fiscal situation. Fiscal deficit target in 2011-12 was likely to slip significantly. 
Some members felt that the fiscal pressure would continue beyond 2011-12 
as the monetary impact of entitlements such as Mahatma Gandhi National 
Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MNREGA), oil, fertiliser and food subsidies 
would be significant. Some members felt that unless there was a clear signal 
of credible fiscal consolidation, the Reserve Bank should hold back the policy 
rate reversal.  
 
5. Members had divergent views on monetary policy and liquidity measures.   
Three external members suggested that the policy repo rate be reduced by 25 
basis points, while one member suggested that it be reduced by 50 basis 
points. Of these, one member also suggested reduction in the cash reserve 
ratio (CRR) by 50 basis points and another by 25 basis points.  Two other 
members did not suggest any change in the CRR. The other three members 
did not recommend any change in the repo rate. Of  these, one member 
suggested reduction in the CRR by 25 basis points, while two others 
suggested that the CRR be changed only, if necessary, and that too outside 
the regular policy announcements.   
 
6. The meeting was chaired by Dr. D. Subbarao, Governor. Other members 
present  were: Dr. Subir Gokarn, Vice-Chairman, Dr. K.C. Chakrabarty, Shri 
Anand Sinha, Shri H.R. Khan; and external members Shri Y.H. Malegam, 
Prof. Indira Rajaraman, Dr. Shankar Acharya, Dr. Rakesh Mohan, Prof. 
Sudipto Mundle, Prof. Errol D ’Souza and Prof. Ashima Goyal. Shri Deepak 
Mohanty, Dr. Janak Raj, Shri B.M. Misra, Shri Pardeep Maria and Shri 
Amitava Sardar were in attendance. 
 
7. Since February 2011, the Reserve Bank has been placing the main points of 
discussions of the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) on Monetary Policy 
meetings in public domain with a lag of roughly four weeks after their 
meetings.
