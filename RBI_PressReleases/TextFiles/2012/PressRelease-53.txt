RBI Working Paper Series 18 / 2012 
Estimating Impacts of Monetary Policy on Aggregate Demand in India 
The Reserve Bank today placed on its website a Working Paper titled “Estimating 
Impacts of Monetary Policy on Aggregate Demand in India” under the RBI Working 
Paper Series. The paper has been authored by Shri Jeevan Kumar Khundrakpam. 
 There seems to be a general consensus that monetary policy affects real 
economy at least in the short run. The manner and channels through which monetary 
policy influences output and prices is, however, still an open and unsettled issue.  Given 
the near unanimity on its short-run impact on the real economy, it is important to 
understand which sectors of the economy feel its impact the most. Another important 
aspect in this context is whether or not the impact is uniformly felt across all components 
of aggregate demand. For instance, macroeconomic implications of reduction in 
aggregate demand due to slowdown in investment following monetary tightening would 
be different than those due to the reduction on account of slowdown in consumption 
demand.  
The paper has made an attempt to estimate the effect of monetary policy (change 
in interest rate) on various components of aggregate demand, namely, private 
consumption, government consumption, investment, exports and imports in India. This is 
done using a structural VAR model on quarterly data from 2000Q1 to 2011Q1.  
The findings of the paper indicate that –  
- An interest rate hike has a significant negative impact on the growth of 
aggregate demand. However, the maximum impact is borne by growth in 
investment demand and in imports.  
- Impact on private consumption growth and exports growth is relatively far 
more subdued, while there is hardly any cumulative impact on growth of 
government consumption.  
- Interest rate accounts for a significant percentage of the fluctuation in the 
growth of all the components of aggregate demand, except government 
consumption, while exchange rate has very little impact.  
- In addition, interest rate channel completely dominates exchange rate 
channel in monetary transmission, though the latter channel has non-
negligible impact on investment and imports.
