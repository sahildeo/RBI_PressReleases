In view of the major deficiencies/ irregularities observed in its working and in public 
interest and in the interest of the depositors, to prevent preferential payment and alienation of 
assets of the bank, directions under Section 35A of the Act were imposed on the bank vide 
directive UBD.CO.BSD-1No.D-02/12.22.184/2010-11 dated July 28, 2010 by the Bank 
(effective from the close of business as on August 2, 2010). The directions, among others, 
prohibited acceptance of fresh deposits and further lending and restricted repayment of 
deposits up to a maximum of `1000/- per depositor. 
The statutory inspection of the bank conducted by the Bank under Section 35 of the 
Act with reference to its financial position as on March 31, 2010 revealed that the financial 
position of the bank had further deteriorated. The assessed net worth of the bank had 
declined from `114.25 lakh as on March 31, 2009 to `83.71 lakh as on March 31, 2010. The 
gross NPAs of the bank had increased from 43.0% of gross advances as on March 31, 2009 
to 49.3% as on March 31, 2010. The net NPAs of the bank had increased from 7.7% of net 
advances to 10.9% during the same period. Performance of the bank in recovery of NPAs 
was not satisfactory as additions to NPAs far exceeded recoveries. The bank could not 
contain accretion to NPAs. Assessed net loss of the bank increased from `15.70 lakh during 
2008-09 to `25.35 lakh during 2009-10. The bank had heavily relied on high cost deposits 
thereby adversely affecting its profitability. Neither the Board nor the senior management 
took initiative in framing risk management policies of the bank. The performance of the 
committees of the Board was not satisfactory. The bank had violated RBI guidelines 
UBD.PCB.Cir.POT.39/ 09.103.01/2001-02 dated April 5, 2002 read with 
UBD.PCB.Cir.41/09.103.01/2007-08 dated April 21, 2008 on induction of professional 
directors on the Board of the bank. 
The statutory inspection of the bank conducted by the Bank under Section 35 of the 
Act with reference to its financial position as on March 31, 2011 revealed that the financial 
position had further deteriorated. Assessed net worth further declined and stood at `62.49 
lakh. Gross NPAs increased to `193.26 lakh (64.0%) and net NPAs increased to `40.19 lakh 
(27.0%) as on March 31, 2011. Recovery of NPA was not found to be satisfactory. As 
against recoveries of `5.90 lakh, fresh additions to NPAs during 2010-11 stood at `28.81 
lakh. The assessed net loss incurred by the bank stood at (-)`18.51 lakh as on March 31, 
2011. The bank has been incurring losses continuously and all profitability ratios had turned 
negative. The bank had admitted as members employees of WIMCO, Ambernath Nagar 
Parishad, ECK Haubod, etc. and had granted loans to some of them in violation of 
instructions contained in paragraph 1(ii) of circular UBD.No.BL.(SEB) 5A/ 07.01.00/2001-02 
dated August 8, 2001 of the Bank. No procedure was laid down to identify, measure, monitor 
and control various risks to which the bank is exposed.  
The deterioration in bank’s financial position showed the inability of the management 
to bring about any major improvement and arrest the deteriorating financial position of the 
bank. The performance of the Board of the bank was not satisfactory as it could not take 
initiative in framing risk management policies of the bank. It is noted from the bank’s letter 
dated April 27, 2012 that the bank had acquired immovable property from Kohinoor Planet 
Constructions Pvt. Ltd. in exchange of premises which was being developed by the company 
by virtue of an agreement, during the pendency of the all-inclusive directions imposed under 
Section 35A of the Act on the bank vide directive UBD.CO.BSD-1No.D-02/12.22.184/2010-
11 dated July 28, 2010 and supervisory action imposed vide letter UBD. MRO.BSS-
II/3358/12.07.184/2007-08 dated March 25, 2008 restraining the bank, interalia, from 
acquiring or shifting its office premises.  
The bank was issued a Show Cause Notice vide letter UBD.CO.BSD-
I/SCN/67/12.22.184/ 2011-12 dated January 12, 2012 advising to show cause within thirty 
days from the date of receipt of the notice, as to why its application dated May 31, 1966 for 
grant of licence to carry on banking business under Section 22 of the Act should not be 
rejected and why steps should not be taken to wind up the bank. The bank’s reply dated 
March 1, 2012 was examined but was not found to be satisfactory. 3 
 
 
Serious deficiencies as mentioned above revealed that the affairs of the bank were 
being conducted in a manner detrimental to the interest of its depositors. It was observed 
that all the major financial parameters of the bank had deteriorated. There was no viable 
merger proposal or for conversion into a society by the bank. The bank had not submitted 
documentary evidence for having brought out any improvement. 
The bank did not fulfil the applicable EPN and had allowed outsiders to be members 
of the salary earner’s bank in violation of extant instructions. The capital structure and 
earning prospects of bank has been declining and the bank is not complying with Section 
22(3)(d) of the Act. The deterioration in bank’s financial position showed the inability of the 
management in arresting the same. Thus, the affairs of the bank are being conducted in a 
manner detrimental to the interest of its present/ future depositors in violation of section 
22(3)(b) of the Act and the general character of the management of the bank is prejudicial to 
the public interest or the interest of its depositors in violation of section 22(3)(c) of the Act.
Therefore, the Bank took the extreme measure of rejection of application of the bank 
for grant of licence, in the interest of bank's depositors. With the rejection of application for 
grant of licence and commencement of liquidation proceedings, the process of paying the 
depositors of the Premier Automobiles Employees’ Co-operative Bank Ltd., Mumbai 
(Maharashtra), the amount insured as per the DICGC Act, will be set in motion subject to the 
terms and conditions of the Deposit Insurance Scheme. 
Consequent to the cancellation of its licence, Premier Automobiles Employees’ Co-
operative Bank Ltd., Mumbai (Maharashtra) is prohibited from carrying on ‘banking business’ 
as defined in Section 5(b) of the Act.
