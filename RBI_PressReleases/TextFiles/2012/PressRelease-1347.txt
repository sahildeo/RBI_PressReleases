 After the Central Board meeting, the Governor also met local bankers and State 
Government officials, led by the Finance Minster of Uttarakhand, Dr. Smt. Indira 
Hridayesh. The decisions taken during the meeting included: 
• Keeping in view the skewed distribution of bank branches in hilly areas, the 
Governor requested the State Government and the banks to prepare an 
action plan to improve banking penetration, especially in hilly areas. He 
assured that if there are any hurdles in terms of regulatory dispensation in 
achieving the objective of financial inclusion, the Reserve Bank would 
consider them sympathetically.   
• The State Government, banks, NABARD and SIDBI agreed to prepare an 
annual action plan, beginning July 2012 with quarterly milestones to be 
achieved, to increase the CD ratio in five districts in a period of one year to 
around 35 per cent.  
• Banks would meet their branch managers along with SIDBI to explore the 
possibilities of increasing credit flow to small and micro enterprises (SME) 
sector, they being the main drivers of growth. 
• The Governor requested the state Government to consider including financial 
literacy as part of school curriculum. 
Earlier on May 23, 2012, the Governor met the Chief Minister of Uttarakhand   
Shri Vijay Bahuguna at his Secretariat, Dehradun and discussed issues relating to 
growth and development of the state.  
Dr. D. Subbarao, Governor also met the industry representatives from 
Uttarakhand in Dehradun Office of the Reserve Bank and discussed issues, such as,

(MSE), rehabilitation of sick industries, relief/ benefits of credit rating of SMES, setting up 
market intelligence cell to support state level industries association, and lending to
