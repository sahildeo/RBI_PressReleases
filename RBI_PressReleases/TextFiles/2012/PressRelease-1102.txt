Indicative Quantum of Market Borrowings by  
State Governments for the Quarter July-September 2012 
 
The Reserve Bank of India, in consultation with the State Governments, 
announces that the indicative quantum of total market borrowings by the State 
Governments and the Union Territory of Puducherry, for the quarter July-September 
2012, is expected to be in the range of `36,000 crore to `40,000 crore. The amount 
will be raised through auction of State Development Loans (SDLs), conducted 
generally on alternate Tuesdays. RBI would endeavour to conduct the auctions in a 
calibrated manner and distribute the borrowings evenly throughout the quarter. The 
actual amount of borrowings would be intimated by way of press release two/three 
days prior to the auction day and would depend on the requirement of the State 
Governments, approval from the Government of India under Article 293(3) of the 
Constitution of India and the market conditions. It may be recalled that market 
participants have been demanding that advance information about the States’ 
market borrowings be disseminated in order to enhance transparency and enable 
them to plan their investments more efficiently. It is expected that release of such 
indicative advance schedule of SDLs would largely meet such demand of the market 
participants and help the State Governments to mobilize resources in a more cost 
effective manner.
