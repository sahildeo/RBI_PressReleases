RBI Occasional papers Vol. 32 No. 2 :  
Monsoon 2011 
The Reserve Bank of India, today released the Monsoon 2011 issue of its 
Occasional Papers. Occasional Papers, a research journal of the Reserve Bank, 
contains contributions of its staff and reflects the views of the authors. This issue is 
woven around some important themes which have been at the forefront of policy 
discussions. The issue contains following articles, special notes and book reviews. 
How Asymmetric is the monetary policy transmission to financial markets in 
India? 
The paper titled “How Asymmetric is the monetary policy transmission to 
financial markets in India?” authored by Bhupal Singh examines a key question 
regarding the existence of asymmetries in the transmission of monetary policy to 
financial market. The author discusses as to how the same magnitude of policy rate 
change causes varied impact on financial asset prices during different phases of 
policy cycle, varied liquidity conditions and across the spectrum of maturity. Using a 
sample period of 2001:M3 to 2012:M6, the author estimates responses of various 
financial asset prices to policy shocks in a dynamic framework using a vector 
autoregression (VAR) model. The empirical estimates suggest that short end of the 
financial market exhibits a significant and contemporaneous (instantaneous) pass-
through in between 40 to 75 basis points in response to a percentage point change in 
the monetary policy rates. The magnitude of contemporaneous as well as lagged 
pass-through, however, differs significantly depending on the state of liquidity 
conditions in financial markets as also the cycle of monetary policy. Significant 
asymmetry is observed in the transmission of policy rate changes between the 
surplus and deficit liquidity conditions, particularly at short end of financial markets, 
suggesting that maintaining suitable liquidity environment is critical to yielding 
improved pass-through. There is also considerable asymmetry found in the 
transmission of monetary policy to financial markets depending on the tightening or 
easing cycles of monetary policy, which suggests the criticality of attaining a 
threshold level for the policy rates under each cycle to have desired pass-through 
impact on spectrum of financial markets. 
Industry Effects of Monetary Transmission Mechanism in India: An Empirical 
Analysis of Use-based Industries 
The paper titled “Industry Effects of Monetary Transmission Mechanism in 
India: An Empirical Analysis of Use-based Industries” by Sarat Dhal evaluates the 
industry effects of monetary policy on disaggregated monetary transmission 
mechanism. The study uses vector auto regression model and monthly data from 
1993 to 2011 pertaining to output growth of five use-based industries, call money rate 
and WPI inflation rate for evaluating the transmission mechanism. The empirical

analysis shows that following a tight money policy shock, the output growth could be 
affected more for consumer durables and capital goods than basic, intermediate and 
consumer non-durable goods. The cumulative moderation in output growth following 
a tight policy could span over 2 to 5 years for capital goods, consumer durables and 
basic goods. Intermediate and consumer non-durable goods could show a relatively 
moderate transient response and transmission lag could be evident only for the 
consumer non-durables. 
Estimating Value at Risk using Filtered Historical Simulation in the Indian 
Capital Market 
In a paper titled “Estimating Value at Risk using Filtered Historical Simulation 
in the Indian capital market”, Indrajit Roy estimates Value at Risk (VaR) of the daily 
return of Indian capital market (SENSEX/NIFTY) using Filtered Historical Simulation 
(FHS). Covering the period January 2003 to December 2009, the author uses 
GARCH framework to model the volatility clustering on returns and examines the 
usefulness of considering lag values of return (on S&P 500, INR-EURO INR-USD 
exchange rate, gold price) as proxies of global financial condition in the specification 
of the mean equation. The VaR is estimated based on two approaches. In the first 
approach, the mean equation of daily return in Indian capital market is captured by its 
own lag and daily return of S&P-500, INR-EURO, INR-USD exchange rate and gold 
price; while volatility is modeled by GARCH model and finally the VaR is estimated 
through FHS. In the second approach, the mean equation is being captured by 
ARMA model, while volatility is modeled by GARCH model and finally the VaR is 
estimated through FHS. It is observed that VaR estimated using GARCH with 
suitable mean specification outperforms VaR estimated based on ARMA-GARCH 
method. 
Special Notes  
In a note on “Regional Inequality in Foreign Direct Investment Flows to India: 
The Problem and the Prospects”, Atri Mukherjee examines the major determinants 
affecting regional distribution of FDI flows in India. Based on the panel data analysis, 
covering period 2000-01 to 2010-11, the author reveals that market size, 
agglomeration effects and size of manufacturing and services base in a state have 
significant positive impact on FDI flows. The impact of taxation and cost of labour is 
negative. While the impact of quality of labour is ambiguous, infrastructure, however, 
has significant positive influence on FDI flows. With the presence of a strong 
agglomeration effect, it is essential to have a conscious and coordinated effort at the 
national and the state government level to make the laggard states more attractive to 
FDI flows.  
Another note titled “Financial Inclusion - IT as enabler” by Sanjeev Kumar 
Gupta emphasises that technology can play an important role in reducing operating 
cost of providing banking services, particularly in the rural and unbanked areas. 
There are technologies that could drive the growth in financial inclusion. The note 
outlines major steps which have been taken so far by the Reserve Bank and 
Government of India to enable financial inclusion for weaker sections of Indian 
society. The efforts made by the Reserve Bank in this direction so far, role of 
Information and Communications Technology with focus on Mobile Banking and 
finally the Unique Identification (UID) number are discussed in detail in the note. The 
author argues that the enrolment to UID and UID enabled bank account will be a 
game changer in the entire process of financial inclusion plan.

Book Reviews 
N. C. Pradhan reviews a book titled “The New Gold Standard: Rediscovering 
the Power of Gold to Protect and Grow Wealth” by Paul Nathan and published by 
John Wiley & Sons, New Jersey, USA. 
The author of the book believes that under a revived new gold standard, there 
is no need for a central bank of last resort. As long as the market is free to operate 
under the rules of the gold standard, the conditions that lead to the kind of excessive 
leverage we have in today's world, could never happen. It is argued in the book that 
the gold standard cannot prevent monetary or economic crises but it prevents the 
kind of debt and leverage levels we see in today’s world. The author argues that a 
country, prepared to go on a gold standard, would have to carry out many reforms. 
For instance, the US federal government may have to stop inflating, balance its 
budget, and abandon welfare programs which are somewhat politically difficult. The 
book also provides guidance on how a gold standard can strengthen the dollar, 
reduce debt, and help stabilise the economy, offering practical strategies for investing 
in gold. 
Avdhesh Kumar Shukla reviews a book titled “Borderless Economics: Chinese 
Sea Turtles, Indian Fridges and the New Fruits of Global Capitalism, authored by 
Robert Guest and published by Palgrave Macmillan, New York. 
The book provides new insights on the multidimensional impacts of migration 
on global economy. The book suggests that the economic impact of migration is 
direct and very effective, unlike foreign aid, which is marred with unwarranted 
leakages and wastages. According to the author, countries particularly, China and 
India have benefited immensely due to their overseas Diaspora. India is the largest 
recipient of remittance income, and about three fourth of foreign direct investment in 
China is made by the Chinese Diaspora. But according to the book, benefits of 
Diaspora is not limited to the economic benefits only but is spread to political and 
cultural aspects also. As regards the issue of brain drain, the book concludes that 
rather than doing harm to emerging economies, brain drain has helped countries to 
reduce global poverty. As regards the impact on advanced economies, the book 
provides an example of the US economy and highlights that migration will lead to 
increase in working age population and will save it from problem of high dependency 
of old age population unlike China.
