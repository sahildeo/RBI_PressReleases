RBI releases Time Series Data on  
Average Daily Wage Rates in Rural India for Men 
The Reserve Bank of India today released time series data on monthly average 
daily wage rates for men in rural India. This data series is collated from the basic data 
collected by the Labour Bureau, Government of India and published in its monthly 
publication entitled ‘Indian Labour Journal’.  
Coverage 
The data on wage rates are published by the Labour Bureau on a regular monthly 
basis in its monthly publication Indian Labour Journal. Wage rate data is collected in 
respect of 11 agricultural and 7 non-agricultural occupations entailing manual work 
under the common framework of data collection of retail prices for Consumer Price Index 
(CPI) for Agricultural and Rural Labourers across 20 major states, namely, Andhra 
Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, 
Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Manipur, Meghalaya, Orissa, 
Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Tripura, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal. The selected 
occupations for which daily wage rates are collected every month are: (a) Agricultural 
Occupations - (i) ploughing, (ii) sowing, (iii) weeding, (iv) transplanting, (v) harvesting, 
(vi) winnowing, (vii) threshing, (viii) picking, (ix) herdsman, (x) well digging and (xi) cane 
crushing; (b) Non-agricultural Occupations – (xii) carpenter, (xiii) blacksmith, (xiv) 
cobbler, (xv) mason, (xvi) tractor driver, (xvii) sweeper, and (xviii) unskilled labour (un-
specified).  
Methodology 
The average wage rates at all-India level are derived by dividing the sum total of 
wages of all the 20 States by the number of quotations collected by the Labour Bureau. 
State-wise averages are estimated only for those occupations where the number of 
quotations is five or more. However, for working out all-India averages, all state level 
quotations are taken into account to arrive at total number of quotations at all-India level. 
At the all-India level also, the number of quotations for working out occupation-wise 
averages are restricted to five or more. The missing values against various occupations 
indicate that no wage rate was reported during the reference month for various reasons, 
such as: (i) either the activity connected with the occupation was not undertaken in the 
State; or (ii) the activity was out of season in the State; or (iii) the particular category of 
workers were not engaged in that operation; or (iv) the number of quotations received is 
less than five. 
Access 
The Reserve Bank’s time series data on wage rates can be accessed from the 
Database of Indian Economy (DBIE) link (http://dbie.rbi.org.in >> Statistics >> Real 
Sector >> Prices and Wages >> Monthly) on the RBI website and downloaded with 
classifications according to time, states and occupations. Detailed methodology for 
compilation of the wage rate is available in a publication entitled ‘Wage Rates in Rural 
India 2008-09’ brought out by the Labour Bureau in 2010 as also on the Labour 
Bureau’s website: http://labourbureau.gov.in
