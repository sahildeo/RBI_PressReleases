Reserve Bank Cancels the Licence of  
Krishna Valley Co-operative Bank Ltd., Kupwad, Sangli (Maharashtra) 
In view of the fact that Krishna Valley Co-operative Bank Ltd., Kupwad, Sangli 
(Maharashtra), had ceased to be solvent, all efforts to revive it in close consultation 
with the Government of Maharashtra had failed and the depositors were being 
inconvenienced by continued uncertainty, the Reserve Bank of India delivered the 
order cancelling its licence to the bank with effect from the close of business on 
March 5, 2012. The Registrar of Co-operative Societies, Maharashtra has also been 
requested to issue an order for winding up the bank and appoint a liquidator for the 
bank.  It may be highlighted that on liquidation, every depositor is entitled to 
repayment of his/ her deposits up to a monetary ceiling of `1,00,000/- (Rupees One 
lakh only) from the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) 
under usual terms and conditions.  
 The bank was granted a licence by Reserve Bank on February 26, 1998 to 
commence banking business. The bank was placed under all-inclusive directions 
under Section 35A of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (As Applicable to Co-
operative Societies) [the Act] in view of the precarious financial position of the bank 
with effect from December 26, 2003 based on the inspections findings with reference 
to its financial position as on March 31, 2003. The Board of Directors was ineffective 
and was responsible for deterioration in the financial position of the bank and for 
conducting the affairs of the bank in a manner detrimental to the interest of the 
depositors. The Board of the bank was superseded on December 26, 2003 by RCS 
and Administrator was appointed to manage the affairs of the bank. 
 Subsequent inspections revealed further deterioration in the financial position 
of the bank. The statutory inspection of the bank under Section 35 of the Act, with 
reference to its financial position as on March 31, 2011 revealed that most of the 
violations observed earlier continued to persist and financial parameters of the bank 
had further deteriorated. As per the findings of the inspection with reference to the 
bank’s position as on March 31, 2011, assessed net worth of the bank stood negative 
at (-) `407.71 lakh, assessed CRAR was (-)532.2% and gross NPAs amounted to 
`319.06 lakh (100%) of gross advances. Erosion in deposits stood at 72.8% of total 
deposits of `559.90 lakh. The bank was also not holding the required CRR, thus 
violating the provisions of Sections 18 of the Act.  
Serious deficiencies as mentioned above revealed that the affairs of the bank 
were being conducted in a manner detrimental to the interest of its depositors. The 
bank does not comply with the provisions of Section 11(1), 18, 22(3)(a) and 22(3)(b) 
of the Act. A show cause notice dated November 29, 2011 was issued to the bank 
requiring it to show cause as to why the licence granted to it under Section 22 of the 
??????????2 
 
Act, on February 26, 1998 to carry on banking business should not be cancelled and 
the bank be taken to liquidation. The bank's reply vide its letter dated December 27, 
2011 was examined and not considered satisfactory. The bank did not submit any 
concrete revival plan or any proposal for merger of the bank.  
The realisable value of bank’s paid-up capital and reserves was negative and 
the chances of revival of the bank were remote. In the absence of any viable action 
plan for revival/ merger, Reserve Bank of India took the extreme measure of 
cancelling licence of the bank in the interest of bank's depositors. With the 
cancellation of licence and commencement of liquidation proceedings, the process of 
paying the depositors of the Krishna Valley Co-operative Bank Ltd., Kupwad, Sangli 
(Maharashtra), the amount insured as per the DICGC Act, will be set in motion 
subject to the terms and conditions of the Deposit Insurance Scheme. 
Consequent to the cancellation of its licence, Krishna Valley Co-operative 
Bank Ltd., Kupwad, Sangli (Maharashtra) is prohibited from carrying on ‘banking 
business’ as defined in Section 5(b) of the Act.
