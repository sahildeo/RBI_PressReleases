RBI releases guidelines on White Label Automated Teller Machines (WLAs) 
The Reserve Bank of India, today released on its website, the final guidelines 
on "White Label Automated Teller Machines (WLAs) in India". White Label ATMs are 
ATMs set up, owned and operated by non-bank entities incorporated in India under 
the Companies Act, 1956. Till now, only banks were permitted to set up Automated 
Teller Machines (ATMs) as extended delivery channels. 
Under the guidelines, non-bank entities incorporated in India under the 
Companies Act, 1956 will be permitted to set up, own and operate ATMs in India. 
Prospective operators/applicants would need to seek authorisation from the Reserve 
Bank under the Payment and Settlement Systems (PSS) Act, 2007. For setting up 
WLAs, entities should have a minimum net worth of Rs. 100 crore as per the latest 
financial year’s audited balance sheet. 
The authorisation can be sought under three schemes: 
Scheme A 
• A minimum of 9,000 WLAs in a period of three years in a ratio of 3:1 – 
that is, minimum of 1000 WLAs to be installed in Year 1, minimum of 
twice the number of WLAs installed in Year 1 to be installed in year 2, 
and minimum of three times the number of WLAs installed in Year 2 to 
be installed in year 3;  
• For every three WLAs installed in Tier III to VI centres, one WLA can 
be installed in Tier I to II centres.  
• Out of the 3 WLAs installed in Tier III to VI centres, a minimum of 10 
per cent should be installed in Tier V & VI centres. 
Scheme B 
• A minimum of 5000 WLAs to be installed every year for three years in 
the ratio of 2:1, that is, for every two WLAs installed in Tier III to VI 
centres, one WLA can be installed in Tier I to II centres.  
• Out of the WLAs installed in Tier III to VI centres, a minimum of 10 per 
cent should be installed in Tier V & VI centres.

Scheme C 
• A minimum of 25,000 WLAs in the first year and at least another 
25,000 in the next two years in the ratio of 1:1.  
• Out of WLAs installed in Tier III to VI centres, a minimum of 10 per 
cent should be installed in Tier V & VI centres 
The Reserve Bank had earlier sought comments from the public on the draft 
guidelines for deployment of WLAs. The final guidelines have been framed after 
taking into consideration the views received from banks, authorised ATM network 
operators, non-bank entities and members of public on the draft guidelines and the 
deliberations with the stakeholders.
