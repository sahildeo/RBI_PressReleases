Reserve Bank Cancels the Licence of Veershaiva Co-operative Bank Ltd., Mumbai 
(Maharashtra) 
In view of the fact that Veershaiva Co-operative Bank Ltd., Mumbai 
(Maharashtra), had ceased to be solvent, all efforts to revive it in close consultation with 
the Government of Maharashtra had failed and the depositors were being 
inconvenienced by continued uncertainty, the Reserve Bank of India delivered the order 
cancelling its licence to the bank as on the close of business on December 30, 2011. The 
Registrar of Co-operative Societies, Maharashtra has also been requested to issue an 
order for winding up the bank and appoint a liquidator for the bank. It may be highlighted 
that on liquidation, every depositor is entitled to repayment of his/ her deposits up to a 
monetary ceiling of `1,00,000/- (Rupees One lakh only) from the Deposit Insurance and 
Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) under usual terms and conditions.  
 The bank was granted a licence by Reserve Bank on March 26, 1974 to 
commence banking business. The bank was issued supervisory instructions on June 18, 
2007 based on the inspections findings with reference to its financial position as on 
March 31, 2006 and these supervisory instructions were modified, from time to time, 
based on the findings of the subsequent inspection reports. 
 The statutory inspection of the bank under Section 35 of the Banking Regulation 
Act, 1949 (As Applicable to Co-operative Societies) [the Act], with reference to its 
financial position as on March 31, 2009 revealed that the assessed networth of the bank 
was negative and the bank’s deposits had eroded to the extent of 13.0%. The CRAR of 
the bank was (-) 35.4% against the regulatory requirement of 9%. The gross and net 
NPA were 57.6% and 44.4% of gross and net advances respectively. The assessed loss 
stood at `3350.95 lakh. Based on the inspection report as on March 31, 2009, the bank 
was advised on October 29, 2009 not to resort to borrowings, allow premature 
withdrawal of deposits, grant fresh loans and explore the possibility of merger with a 
sound UCB.  
Inspection of the bank with reference to its financial position as on March 31, 2009 
also revealed that the bank had sanctioned loans to 192 individuals at its Kandivali 
branch amounting to `210.00 lakh through a tie-up arrangement with an auto dealer, M/s 
Satguru Auto. In about 145 cases the lien endorsements obtained from RTO were found 
not to be genuine and hence these were treated by the bank as fraudulent transactions. 
RCS had conducted enquiry under Section 83 of the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies 
Act, 1960 (in short ‘MCS Act, 1960’) for the frauds perpetrated at the bank. As informed 
by RCS, the enquiry officer had submitted his report under section 83 of the MCS Act, 
1960 on February 08, 2010 which revealed fraud and misappropriation of funds in 
respect of auto loans at Kandivili branch and irregularities in other loans sanctioned at 
Andheri branch. As per the report, apart from the said auto loans, the bank had 
?????????? 2
disbursed other loans having insufficient mortgage security and lack of repayment 
capacity of borrowers involving 76 loan accounts with total outstanding of `6253.44 lakh 
where the bank may suffer loss. 
The statutory inspection of the bank with reference to its financial position as on 
March 31, 2010 revealed that the financial indicators of the bank has further deteriorated 
and its assessed net worth stood at `(-)3383.32 lakh and assessed CRAR stood at (-) 
53.2%. The erosion in deposits increased to 15.9%. The gross and net NPAs formed 
69.8% and 58.4% of the gross and net advances respectively. The inspection report was 
forwarded to the bank on June 24, 2010 for rectification of deficiencies and compliance. 
However, the compliance report submitted by the bank vide letter dated August 23, 2010 
was not considered satisfactory. Based on the inspection findings as on March 31, 2010 
the bank was advised on August 27, 2010 that existing Supervisory Action/ Operational 
Instructions will continue. 
 The statutory inspection of the bank as on March 31, 2011 revealed that the 
financial position of the bank continued to deteriorate. The assessed net worth as on 
March 31, 2011 stood at (-)Rs.5231.01 lakh, CRAR stood negative at (-)139.6% deposits 
have also been eroded to the extent of 33.4%, gross NPA constituted 79.1% of gross 
advances, net NPA constituted 63.0% and the loss was assessed at `3659.32 lakh 
during 2010-11.  
In view of the steep deterioration in its financial position since 2008-09 as 
revealed by successive inspections from March 31, 2009, the bank was placed under all-
inclusive directions under section 35A of the Act vide order UBD.CO.BSD-I/D-
46/12.22.293/2011-12 with effect from the close of business on August 3, 2011. 
The quality of management and the standard of governance in the bank were 
poor. The Board was ineffective in laying down policies for management of the key asset 
portfolio and was not able to ensure observance of even laid down policy guidelines. 
There was complete absence of efforts for improvement of the bank’s financial position. 
The management had failed to present the true and fair view of affairs of the bank in its 
published financial statements for several years to the members, depositors and public. 
The performance of the Board was not satisfactory, as evident from the continued 
deterioration in the bank’s financial position as well as various violations of regulatory 
guidelines. The management had not displayed sufficient firmness/ seriousness in 
dealing with the staff responsible for the irregularities also recovery of NPAs. The Board 
of Directors was ineffective and is responsible for deterioration in the financial position of 
the bank and for conducting the affairs of the bank in a manner detrimental to the interest 
of the depositors. TAFCUB had also recommended that SCN may be issued to the bank. 
Accordingly SCN dated August 17, 2011 was issued to the bank requiring it to show 
cause as to why the licence granted to it under Section 22 of the Act, on March 26, 1974 
to carry on banking business should not be cancelled and the bank be taken to 
liquidation.  
The submissions made by the bank in reply to the show cause notice were 
examined and not found satisfactory. There was no concrete revival plan or merger 
proposal from the bank.  
Therefore, Reserve Bank of India took the extreme measure of cancelling licence 
of the bank in the interest of bank's depositors. With the cancellation of licence and 
commencement of liquidation proceedings, the process of paying the depositors of the 
Veershaiva Co-operative Bank Ltd., Mumbai (Maharashtra), the amount insured as per 
the DICGC Act, will be set in motion subject to the terms and conditions of the Deposit 
Insurance Scheme.  3
Consequent to the cancellation of its licence, Veershaiva Co-operative Bank Ltd., 
Mumbai (Maharashtra) is prohibited from carrying on ‘banking business’ as defined in 
Section 5(b) of the Act.
