Bulletin today. The March 2012 issue carries five  special  articles (i) A Review of the 
Trends in National Income Aggregates (ii) North-East Monsoon 2011: A Review (iii) 
International Banking Statistics for September 2011 (iv) Investment Portfolio of 
Scheduled Commercial Banks: March 2011; and (v) India’s Foreign Trade: 2011-12

Highlights of the special articles are: 
1. A Review of the Trends in National Income Aggregates  
 This article reviews the trends in national income aggregates based on Quick 
Estimates for 2010-11 and Advance Estimates for 2011-12 that were released by the 
Central Statistics Office (CSO) on January 30, 2012 and February 7, 2012, 
respectively. 
Main Findings: 
• After a smart recovery during 2009-10 and 2010-11, real growth slipped 
sharply to 6.9 per cent during 2011-12, largely on account of the deterioration 
in the external environment and the slowdown in domestic investment. 
  
• The real GDP growth in 2011-12 was below the trend rate.  
 
• Seasonally adjusted growth rates also corroborated the loss of momentum in 
overall activity.  
 
• Notwithstanding the recent slowdown, the rate of growth of the Indian 
economy remained quite impressive in a cross-country context. 
 
• The structural changes in the Indian economy over the years point towards a 
reduction in the share of agriculture, near-stability in the share of industry and 
increase in the share of services. 
 
• Both savings and investment rates dipped during 2010-11 mainly reflecting a 
decline in the household financial savings rate and the private corporate 
sector investment rate, respectively.  
 
• The public sector’s saving-investment gap has also increased substantially in 
recent years.

2. North-East Monsoon 2011: A Review 
This article reviews deficient North-East monsoon and finds that it is not likely 
to impact the agricultural prospects during the year. 
Main Findings 
• The North-East monsoon during October-December 2011 was 48 per cent 
below normal as against 21 per cent above normal in the previous year. 
 
• This has been the most acute deficiency in the last one decade. However, 
reflective of the resilience of Indian agriculture and its reduced dependence 
on rainfall in recent years, the adverse impact of deficient North-East 
monsoon during 2011 on overall agricultural production has not been severe.  
 
• Production of foodgrains during 2011-12 is estimated to be at a record level. 
However, production of pulses and oilseeds is estimated to be lower than that 
of the previous year. 
 
• The progress of rabi sowing, so far in the season, has been satisfactory. 
 
• Live storage to total storage capacity at 50 per cent as on February 8, 2012 
for all the major 81 reservoirs is comfortable and comparable with the 
previous year. Given this, agriculture and allied sector is expected to grow 
close to trend level during 2011-12.  
 
• This is significant given the high growth of 7 per cent experienced by the 
sector during the year 2010-11. 
3. International Banking Statistics for September 2011  
This article presents analysis of international liabilities and assets of banks in 
India, classified under Locational Banking Statistics (LBS) and consolidated

FCNR(B), Non Resident Ordinary (NRO) and Non Resident External (NRE)

• At end-September 2011, the annual increase in the international liabilities was 
reflected in the increase in the liabilities towards USA, UK and India.
