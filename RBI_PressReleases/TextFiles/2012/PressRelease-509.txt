ING Vysya Bank Ltd. and ICICI Bank Ltd. - Penalised 
 
The Reserve Bank of India has imposed monetary penalties of `55 lakh on 
ING Vysya Bank Ltd. and `30 lakh on ICICI Bank Ltd., in exercise of the powers 
vested with it under the provisions of Section 47A(1)(b) read with Section 46(4)(i) of 
the Banking Regulation Act, 1949. The penalties have been imposed on these banks 
for contravention of various directions and instructions issued by the RBI on ‘Know 
Your Customer (KYC) norms/Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Standards/Combating of 
Financing of Terrorism (CFT)/Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002’, such as 
failure to obtain adequate documents for opening accounts, failure to carry out 
sufficient customer identification procedures, failure to examine control structure of 
entities, failure to ascertain the identification of natural persons behind entities, 
failure to carry out effective enhanced due diligence, failure to carry out appropriate 
risk categorisation and delay in filing the Suspicious Transaction Reports. 
 
 The RBI had issued Show Cause Notices to these banks and in response 
thereto, the banks had submitted their written replies. On a careful examination of 
the banks’ written replies and the oral submissions made during the personal 
hearings, the RBI found that the violations were established and the penalties were 
accordingly imposed.
