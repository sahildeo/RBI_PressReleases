RBI Working Paper Series 15 / 2012 
 
Sovereign Debt Management and Monetary Policy in India:  
An Empirical Investigation of Conflict of Interest Argument 
The Reserve Bank of India today placed on its website a Working Paper titled 
"Sovereign Debt Management and Monetary Policy in India: An Empirical 
Investigation of Conflict of Interest Argument". The paper has been written by       
Shri Sunil Kumar and Shri N.R.V.V.M.K. Rajendra Kumar. 
The separation of sovereign debt management (SDM) from Reserve Bank of 
India (RBI) has often been suggested based on the conflict of interest argument. The 
main thrust of this argument is that cost minimisation for government’s market 
borrowing programme might be deterring the Reserve Bank from increasing the 
interest rates and in the process it might be compromising  its core mandate of price 
stability. Against the above backdrop, this paper attempts to verify empirically the 
tenability of this argument in the case of India. 
  This paper estimates the augmented monetary policy reaction function in a 
VAR framework, taking monthly data from April 2004 to December 2011 and then 
with quarterly data from 2000:Q1 to 2011:Q4 to corroborate the results of estimation 
with monthly data. It is found that that level of government market borrowing does 
not explain the statistically significant portion of forecast error variation of the policy 
operating target rate. Further, the results of Impulse Response Function (IRF) 
demonstrate that response of policy operating target rate to one Standard Deviation 
(SD) innovation in the government market borrowing remains statistically 
insignificant. Moreover, the VAR Granger Causality results find that government 
market borrowing does not Granger cause the policy operating rate. Hence, the 
results of all tests in VAR -show that the response of the policy operating target rate 
to the Government market borrowing is not statistically significant and hence, it can 
be inferred that the quantum/ size of the government market borrowing is not 
influencing the policy rate decisions of the RBI. Therefore, it may be concluded that 
the aforementioned conflict of interest argument is not tenable in the Indian context. 
In the above backdrop, the separation of SDM from Reserve Bank to a Public Debt 
Management Agency, for which the process is already underway, could be justified 
by other policy imperatives, if any, but not by conflict of interest argument.   
The Reserve Bank of India introduced the RBI Working Papers series in 
March 2011. These papers present research in progress of the staff members of RBI 
and are disseminated to elicit comments and further debate. The views expressed in 
these papers are those of authors and not that of the Reserve Bank of India. 
Comments and observations may kindly be forwarded to authors. Citation and use of 
such papers should take into account its provisional character.
