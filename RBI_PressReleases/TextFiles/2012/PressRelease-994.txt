Revised Guidelines on Priority Sector Lending-Targets and Classification 
The Reserve Bank of India today released on its website revised guidelines on 
Priority Sector Lending-Targets and Classification. 
 The priority sectors are broadly taken as those sectors of the economy which, if 
not designated as priority sectors, may not get timely and adequate credit. Typically 
these are small value loans to farmers for agriculture and allied activities, micro and 
small enterprises, poor people for housing, students for education and other low income 
groups and weaker sections.  
The revised guidelines aim at implementing the essence of recommendations of 
Nair Committee without dismantling the established and accepted structure of priority 
sector lending. The overall target under priority sector is retained at 40 percent as 
suggested by the Nair Committee. The targets under both direct and indirect agriculture 
are retained at 13.5 percent and 4.5 percent respectively while refocusing the direct 
agricultural lending to individuals, Self Help Groups (SHGs) and Joint Liability Groups 
(JLGs) directly by banks. The focus of the revised guidelines is also on direct lending by 
banks and not through intermediaries like Non Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) 
and Housing Finance Companies (HFCs). 
The highlights of the revised priority sector guidelines are:  
• Overall target under priority sector is retained at 40 per cent as suggested by Nair 
Committee.  
• The targets for both direct and indirect agricultural lending are kept unchanged at 
13.5 per cent and 4.5 per cent of Adjusted Net Bank Credit, respectively. 
• The following important activities, among others, form part of priority sector 
lending as per the revised guidelines: 
- Loans to Micro and Small Service enterprises up-to 1 crore and all loans to 
Micro and Small manufacturing enterprises  
 
- Loans upto  25 lakh for housing in metropolitan centres of population above 
10 lakh and 15 lakh at other centres. 
 
- Loans to Food and Agro processing units. 
 
- Loans to individuals for educational purposes including for vocational courses 
upto   10 lakh in India and 20 lakh abroad. 
??????????2 
 
- Loans for housing projects exclusively for economically weaker sections and 
low income groups, provided the cost does not exceed 5 lakh per dwelling 
unit. 
 
- Loans to distressed farmers indebted to non institutional lenders. 
 
- Overdrafts upto  50000/- in No-Frills account. 
 
- Loans to State Sponsored Organisations for scheduled castes and scheduled 
tribes. 
 
- Loans to individuals for setting up of off-grid solar and other off-grid 
renewable energy solutions for households. 
 
- Loans to individuals other than farmers upto 50000/- to prepay their debt to 
non- institutional lenders. 
• Foreign banks having 20 or more branches in the country will be brought on par 
with domestic banks for priority sector targets in a phased manner over a 
maximum period of 5 years starting April 1, 2013. They will be required to submit 
an action plan for achieving the targets over a specific time frame to be approved 
by RBI. 
• The foreign banks with less than 20 branches will have no sub targets within the 
overall priority sector lending target of 32 per cent. This is expected to allow them 
to lend as per their core competence to any priority sector category. 
• Bank loans to Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS), Farmers' Service 
Societies (FSS) & Large Adivasi Multi-Purpose Co-operative Societies (LAMPS) 
ceded to or managed/controlled by such banks for on-lending to farmers for 
agricultural and allied activities are included under direct agriculture.  
• Investments by banks in securitised assets, outright purchases of loans and 
assignments to be eligible for classification under priority sector provided the 
underlying assets qualify for priority sector treatment and the interest rate 
charged to the ultimate borrower by the originating entity does not exceed Base 
Rate of such bank plus 8 per cent per annum. 
Background 
  
 It may be recalled that as proposed in Para 94 of Monetary Policy Statement 
2011-12, a Committee (Chairman: Shri M.V. Nair) was set up in August 2011 to re-
examine the existing classification & suggest revised guidelines with regard to Priority 
Sector Lending Classification and related issues. The Committee submitted its report in 
February 2012 which was placed in public domain for comments. The recommendations 
of the Committee have been examined based on interface with and comments received 
from various stakeholders. The Committee has stated that the robust reporting system 
with granularity and system generation of priority sector data is of utmost importance for 
proper monitoring and appropriate policy making. The Reserve Bank of India is seized of 
the issue and separate guidelines will be issued in due course
