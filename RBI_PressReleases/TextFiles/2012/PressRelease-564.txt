Indicative Quantum of Market Borrowings by  
State Governments for the Quarter October- December 2012 
 
Reserve Bank of India, in consultation with the State Governments, 
announces that the indicative quantum of total market borrowings by the State 
Governments and the Union Territory of Puducherry, for the quarter October-
December 2012, is expected to be in the range of `55,000 crore to `60,000 crore. 
The amount will be raised through auction of State Development Loans (SDLs) 
conducted generally on alternate Tuesdays. RBI would endeavour to conduct the 
auctions in a calibrated manner and distribute the borrowings evenly throughout the 
quarter. The actual amount of borrowings would be intimated by way of press 
release two/three days prior to the actual auction day and would depend on the 
requirement of the State Governments, approval from the Government of India under 
Article 293(3) of the Constitution of India and the market conditions.
