RBI Governor Dr. D. Subbarao appealed to the banks to  
conduct town hall events in local languages 
"Every bank should conduct a Town Hall event in a chosen state entirely in the 
local language. In this regard, they may coordinate with Reserve Bank’s Customer 
Service Department and Department of Communication to draw up a programme.  This 
will be our collective effort to reach out to people in their own language".  
Dr. D. Subbarao, Governor, Reserve Bank of India appealed to the banks today 
at Mumbai while awarding the Rajbhasha Shields for the year 2010-2011.   
Explaining the background of the appeal, Governor said that every year in the 
month of October Reserve Bank has been conducting town hall meetings. Usually these 
meetings are conducted in Tier II cities. While recollecting the RBI's experiences in such 
meetings he said that the questions in Hindi reflect a different set of concerns from those 
that are asked in English.  The Hindi questions typically reflect middle class anxieties 
and aspirations. The grievances they bring about are different, more common and more 
intractable. "Listening to these questions in Hindi and attempting to answer them has 
been a great learning experience for me and for the Deputy Governors of RBI who 
participate in the Town Hall events along with me".  Dr. Subbarao also encouraged the 
banks to take the lead in conducting town hall events to provide a forum for interacting 
with the public and for listening to their grievances, and suggestions. Adding that five 
such programmes have already been conducted, he appealed to the banks to conduct 
similar town hall events. 
The annual Reserve Bank Rajbhasha Shield was instituted in 1980 to encourage 
public sector banks to use Hindi in their day-to-day work. The Reserve Bank also 
conducts a competition for the house journals of banks and financial institutions. The 
Reserve Bank started an Inter-Bank Hindi Essay Competition from 2002-03. List of 
winners is enclosed. 
On this occasion Dr. Subir Gokarn, Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India 
while complimenting the prize winning banks and financial institutions said that the 
banking scenario has been changing in a rapid pace.  Technology advancement has 
brought changes in the working pattern of banking.  With the implementation of 
packages like core banking solutions (CBS), language issues are being resolved easily.  
He expressed his happiness that the banks have started issuing pass books in Hindi 
through CBS.   
Earlier, Shri Bazil Shaikh, Chief General Manager, Human Resource 
Management Department welcomed the Chief Executives of banks and financial 
institutions. Dr. Ramakant Gupta, Deputy General Manager, Rajbhasha Department, 
Reserve Bank of India conducted the programme and also proposed a vote of thanks. 
The function was attended by chairmen and other senior executives of banks and 
financial institutions.
