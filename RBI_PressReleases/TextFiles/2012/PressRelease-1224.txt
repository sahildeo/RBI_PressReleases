involved in framing a proposal for a comprehensive resolution regime in the country 
for all types of financial institutions, in compliance with the Financial Stability Board’s

lead in plugging these gaps. It resolved to take forward the work on setting up a 
regulatory framework for Investment Advisory Services.  
 The functioning of the Technical Group for Financial Inclusion and Literacy
