Signing of the Bilateral Swap Arrangement between Japan and India 
The Bank of Japan (BOJ), acting as the agent for the Minister of Finance of 
Japan, and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) concluded a Bilateral Swap 
Arrangement (BSA) between Japan and India. The BSA was signed by Governor 
Masaaki Shirakawa of the BOJ and Governor D. Subbarao of the RBI and become 
effective as of December 4, 2012. 
The BSA enables both countries to swap their local currencies (i.e., either 
Japanese yen or Indian rupee) against US dollar for an amount up to USD 15 billion. 
In the past, both countries had a similar arrangement for an amount up to             
USD 3 billion for a period of 3 years from June 2008 to June 2011.   
The arrangement aims at addressing short-term liquidity difficulties and 
supplementing the existing international financial arrangements, as one of the efforts 
in strengthening mutual cooperation between Japan and India. 
The BSA will be activated when an IMF-support program already exists or is 
expected to be established in the near future. Nevertheless, up to 20 percent of the 
maximum amount of drawing could be disbursed without an IMF-support program. 
This enhancement of the BSA will further strengthen economic and financial 
cooperation between the two countries and accordingly contribute to ensuring 
financial market stability.  
The BSA shall be effective for a three (3)-year period.
