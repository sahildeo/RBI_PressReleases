Credit and Growth Cycles in India: An Empirical Assessment of 
 the Lead and Lag Behaviour: RBI Working Paper Series No. 22 
The Reserve Bank of India today placed a Working Paper Series No. 22 titled 
"Credit and Growth Cycles in India: An Empirical Assessment of the Lead and Lag 
Behaviour" by Krittika Banerjee.  
Procyclicality of credit has received significant policy attention in the post-crisis 
period, given the role of credit in fostering growth on the one hand and the role of 
excessive leverage in magnifying risks to financial stability on the other. For the conduct 
of monetary policy and for forging appropriate macro-prudential policies, assessment of 
the credit cycle relative to the business cycle in the country specific context has become 
important. Set against this background, this paper studies the extent of procyclicality of 
credit in India focussing on the lead and lag relationship between credit cycles and 
growth cycles. It starts with the basic question, as to whether credit leads or lags behind 
growth in the economy as a whole and how the relationship varies over time and across 
sectors/industry groups and then empirically examines the position at both macro and 
micro levels. The paper also discusses existing literature on procyclicality and business 
cycle analysis and emerging trends in finances to Indian corporate sector.  
It uses Hodrick-Prescott filter to estimate growth cycles in output and credit. 
Granger causality test and cross correlations are used to understand the lead-lag 
dynamics between these cycles. Growth rate cycles have been used for the industry-
wise analysis. 
The major inference this paper draws is that output leads credit in the post-reform 
period contrary to the pre-reform period when credit used to lead output growth. The 
non-agricultural sector is also seen to have output causing credit. This paper also 
suggests that credit intensity of growth declines only in the second half of a 
contractionary phase of the business cycle, which generally continues in the first half of 
the expansionary phase of the business cycle. Similarly, the increase in credit intensity 
becomes more visible only in the second half of the expansionary phase, which persists 
in the first half of the contractionary phase of the business cycle. Examining the extent of 
procyclicality across industries, the paper suggests that unlike monetary policy, macro-
prudential policies could be sector-specific, depending on the assessment of financial 
stability risks from specific sectors. The lead role of credit over certain phases of the 
business cycle and for some of the industry groups suggests that monetary and macro-
prudential policies could be aligned accordingly so as to improve the assessment of 
inflation and financial stability implications of business cycles. Procyclicality risks have 
been found to be higher in certain industry groups relative to others.
