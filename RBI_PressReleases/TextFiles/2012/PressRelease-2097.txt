The Centre for Advanced Financial Research and Learning (CAFRAL) has 
been promoted by the Reserve Bank of India.  
The global financial crisis has demonstrated the need to better understand the 
complex interactions between the financial system and the real economy. While 
stability has become the main focus of the regulatory changes, the implications for 
growth and equity are also important. To think through these issues and provide an 
emerging market perspective, CAFRAL, in collaboration with the Bank for 
International Settlements, organised an international conference of central banks 
and regulators on “Financial regulation and its implications for growth equity and 
stability in the post crisis world”.  
Several international experts and 26 representatives from 21 central banks/ 
regulators joined the Reserve Bank Governor Dr. D. Subbarao and BIS General 
Manager Mr. Jaime Caruana at this Conference.
