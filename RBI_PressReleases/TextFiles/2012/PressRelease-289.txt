RBI Governor to inaugurate International Conference on  
Cooperatives in Pune on November 16, 2012 
Dr. D. Subbarao, Governor, Reserve Bank of India will inaugurate and deliver 
a key-note address at a two-day International Conference on Cooperatives on 
November 16, 2012 in Pune. The conference is being hosted by the Reserve Bank’s 
College of Agricultural Banking, Pune on November 16 and 17, 2012 to 
commemorate the International Year of the Cooperatives.   
The United Nations has declared the year 2012 as the International Year of 
Cooperatives in recognition of the contributions of cooperatives to socio-economic 
development throughout the world, and to further strengthen cooperatives worldwide.   
The Reserve Bank of India established the College of Agricultural Banking 
(CAB) in year 1969 to cater to the training needs of the Rural Banking and the 
Cooperative Banking Sector. The College has been instrumental in capacity building 
in the sector through affordable training initiatives. 
The theme of the conference is “Leveraging Cooperative Advantage” in which 
many eminent international resource persons are participating as speakers/ 
presenters/commentators. Among the organisations participating in the conference 
are: World Council of Credit Unions (WOCCU) USA, European Association of 
Cooperative Banks (EACB) Brussels, DGRV Germany, RABO Netherlands, 
Federation of Savings and Credit Cooperation Thailand. 
Dr. A. Vaidyanathan, Honorary Fellow, Centre for Development Studies, 
Thiruvananthapuram will deliver special address on November 17, 2012. The 
Conference Valediction on November 17, 2012 will be chaired by Shri Anand Sinha, 
Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India.  
Cooperatives represent a model of economic enterprise which promotes 
community self-reliance and benefits society in general. The cooperative movement 
has been active in the agriculture and allied activities, handlooms and in promoting 
thrift and savings.  
In India the cooperative movement is very old – the Cooperative Credit 
Societies Act was passed in 1904 - and has been playing a significant role both in 
the financial and non-financial sector. The growth of co-operatives in India is 
impressive and covers a wide variety of activities including credit and banking, 
fertiliser, sugar, dairy, marketing, consumer goods, handloom, handicraft, fisheries, 
housing etc. The Indian co-operative movement, comprising around six lakh co-
operatives and more than 24 crore members is arguably the largest cooperative 
movement in the world, providing self employment to millions of poor.

The Reserve Bank of India has played a crucial role in the development of 
cooperative movement in the country especially in the promotion of cooperatives in 
the financial sector. The wide network of cooperative banks across different parts of 
the country acts as effective instrument to bring people from far-flung areas under 
the formal banking network. The cooperative banking sector in India plays an 
important role by providing financial intermediation services to agricultural and allied 
activities, small scale industries and self employed workers. However, the poor 
financial health of cooperative banks in general, and grass root level cooperatives in 
particular, remains an impediment, which needs to be addressed in order to fully 
utilise the benefits of wide spread network of these institutions.
