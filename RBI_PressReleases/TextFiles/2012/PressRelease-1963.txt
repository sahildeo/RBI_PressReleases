Manappuram Finance Limited, Thrissur  
cannot accept/renew Public Deposits : RBI 
 
The Reserve Bank of India today advised  that Manappuram Finance Limited, 
Thrissur, Kerala (earlier known as Manappuram General Finance and Leasing Ltd.), 
is not permitted under the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, to accept/renew deposits 
from the public.  
The Reserve Bank has stated that acceptance of deposits either by 
Manappuram Finance Limited or by Manappuram Agro Farms (MAGRO) is 
punishable with imprisonment and has cautioned members of public that those who 
deposit money with Manappuram Finance Limited or MAGRO do so at their own risk. 
Background  
Manappuram Finance Limited, Thrissur, Kerala (earlier known as 
Manappuram General Finance and Leasing Ltd.), was a company registered with the 
Reserve Bank of India as a deposit taking Non-Banking Financial Company. 
However, it became a non-deposit taking non-banking financial company with effect 
from March 22, 2011. Acceptance of deposits from the public, including renewal of 
matured deposits by that company, thus, amounts to contravention of the terms and 
conditions of the certificate of registration currently held by it and the directions 
issued to the Reserve Bank and thus punishable under the Reserve Bank of India, 
1934 (RBI Act). 
It has come to the notice of the Reserve Bank that Manappuram Finance 
Limited has been accepting deposits from the public in its branches and offices has 
been issuing deposit receipts in the name of Manappuram Agro Farms (MAGRO), a 
sole proprietary concern of Shri V.P Nandakumar who is the Executive Chairman of 
the company. It is further observed that in some cases instead of repaying the 
matured deposits, fixed deposit receipts are being issued in the name of MAGRO. In 
terms of Section 45-S of the RBI Act, acceptance of deposits from the public by 
MAGRO, which is an unincorporated body, is also prohibited.
