RBI Working Paper Series 9 / 2012 
 Impact of monetary policy actions on inflation is modest and subject to lags  
The Reserve Bank of India today placed on its website a Working Paper No. 9 
/ 2012 titled “Monetary Transmission Mechanism in India: A Quarterly Model”. The 
Working Paper has been written by Shri Muneesh Kapur and Shri Harendra Behera. 
The paper “Monetary Transmission Mechanism in India: A Quarterly Model” 
examines the impact of monetary policy actions on growth and inflation. Given the 
volatility emanating from the agricultural sector, the paper models both overall 
growth and overall inflation as well as non-agricultural growth and non-food 
manufactured products inflation, i.e., components stripped of the influence from the 
agricultural sector and which are more amenable to monetary actions. The paper 
also estimates the impact of oil prices, real exchange rate and fiscal variables on 
growth and of exchange rate and minimum support prices on inflation.  
Model simulations show that a one-quarter 100 basis points (bps) increase in 
the nominal effective policy rate leads to a peak reduction of 40 bps in non-
agricultural growth (with a lag of 2 quarters) and of 25 bps on non-food manufactured 
products inflation (with a lag of 5 quarters). The results are sensitive to alternative 
measures of real interest rate. The estimates of interest rate on growth and inflation 
presented in the paper are average coefficients and the actual impact of monetary 
policy actions on growth and inflation would, inter alia, depend upon the stage of the 
business cycle and liquidity conditions.  
Overall, the results indicate that the interest rate channel is effective in the 
Indian context and the magnitude of the impact on growth and inflation is 
comparable to that in major advanced and emerging economies. However, the 
evidence for both India and other countries suggests that the impact of monetary 
policy actions on inflation is modest and subject to lags. Despite the monetary 
tightening by the Reserve Bank of India during 2010 and 2011, inflation remained 
high and this could be attributed to the structural component of food inflation as well 
as the surge in international commodity prices beginning the second half of 2010 and 
continuing into the first half of 2011.  
The Reserve Bank of India introduced the RBI Working Papers series in 
March 2011. These papers present research in progress of the staff members of RBI 
and are disseminated to elicit comments and further debate. The views expressed in 
these papers are those of authors and not that of the Reserve Bank of India. 
Comments and observations may please be forwarded to authors. Citation and use 
of such papers should take into account its provisional character.
