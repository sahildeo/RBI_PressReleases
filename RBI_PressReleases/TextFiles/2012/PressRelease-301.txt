3. Quarterly Industrial Outlook Survey: July-September 2012 (Round 59) 
This article presents the findings of Industrial Outlook Survey conducted for 
the July-September 2012 quarter - 59th round in the series. The survey provides an 
assessment of business situation of companies in the manufacturing sector for the 
quarter July-September 2012, and their expectation for the ensuing quarter October-
December 2012. 
????? ??????????????2 
 
Main Findings 
? The demand conditions as reflected in the net response for production, order 
books, capacity utilisation, imports and exports have further weakened in 
Q2:2012-13. However, the outlook for Q3: 2012-13 showed a marginal 
improvement.  
? Optimism level for overall financial situation declined further in the 
assessment quarter. Marginal improvement is expected for the ensuing 
quarter. Sentiment on availability of finance followed a similar trend. Cost of 
external finance and cost of raw material were perceived to rise but by a lower 
percentage of respondents as compared to the previous quarter. The profit 
margin which had been declining for the last few quarters is expected to 
remain at the same level in Q3:2012-13. 
? The Business Expectation Index, a measure that gives a single snapshot of 
the industrial outlook, showed moderation for the assessment quarter and 
reached a level seen at the onset of financial crisis in Q3:2008-09. However 
the outlook for Q3:2012-13 was marginally better.  
4. Quarterly Order Books, Inventories and Capacity Utilisation Survey: April-
June 2012 (Round 18) 
This article, fifth in the series, presents the findings of the 18th round of the 
Order Books, Inventories and Capacity Utilisation Survey (OBICUS). The survey was 
conducted for the April-June 2012 quarter (Q1:2012-13) among a sample of 
manufacturing companies. It captures the movements in important indicators of 
economic activity, such as, order books, inventories and capacity utilisation, 
inflationary pressures and overall business cycle, which are useful for assessing 
consumption and investment demand outlook. 
Main Findings 
? Average new orders of respondent companies increased in Q1: 2012-13 over 
the previous quarter. The higher year-on-year growth was partially caused by 
the lower base. 
? Capacity utilisation level which had increased in Q4: 2011-12 moderated 
substantially in Q1: 2012-13. The current capacity utilisation level is the lowest 
in last 13 quarters. 
? Both finished goods inventory to sales ratio and raw materials inventory to 
sales ratio increased in Q1: 2012-13 over the previous quarter. 
5. Inflation Expectations Survey of Households: September 2012 (Round 29) 
The findings of  the 29th round of Inflation Expectations Survey of Households 
for July-September 2012 quarter, conducted during the first fortnight of September 
2012 are presented in the article. The survey captures the inflation expectations of 
4,000 urban households across 12 cities for the next three-month period and for the 
next one-year period. These expectations are based on their individual consumption 
baskets and hence, should not be considered as predictors of any official measure of 
inflation. The households’ inflation expectations provide useful directional information 
on near-term inflationary pressures and also supplement other economic indicators 
to get a better indication of future inflation. The survey  results are based on replies 
of the respondents and do not necessarily reflect the perceptions of the Reserve 
Bank of India. 3 
 
Main Findings 
? The perceived current inflation and three-month ahead  inflation expectations 
based on median as well as mean inflation rate have moved down as compared 
with the previous round. However, in the case of one-year ahead period, 
median inflation expectation has moved up while mean inflation expectation has 
moved down as compared with the previous round. 
? The three-month and one-year ahead inflation expectations are higher than the 
perceived mean current inflation rate (10.6 per cent) by 90 and 210 basis 
points, respectively. 
? The percentage of respondents expecting increase in general prices by ‘more 
than current rate’ for three-month ahead period has decreased noticeably to 
78.9 from 83.6 per cent; in contrast, that for one-year ahead has gone up to 
86.8 from 84.4 per cent as compared to the previous round. 
6. Consumer Confidence Survey: September 2012 (Round 10) 
This article presents the salient findings of the Consumer Confidence Survey 
th 
conducted in September 2012, the 10 round in the series. The survey covers 5,124 
households well spread in six metro cities. Based on perceptions of respondents on 
general economic and their own financial situation, the survey captures the 
households’ confidence in the current and expected economic conditions, household 
circumstances, employment conditions, current and future spending and prices. The 
survey results are based on replies of the respondents and do not necessarily reflect 
the perceptions of the Reserve Bank of India. 
Main Findings 
? While sentiments about current and future economic conditions have been 
declining over the last four quarters, for the first time in this survey, the net 
response on perceptions about current economic conditions turned negative.  
? There has been a noticeable drop in the positive perceptions on household 
circumstances, income and price level. However, due to sharp rise in 
proportion of respondents reporting increase in spending as compared to a 
year ago, the Current Situation Index in September 2012 remained by and 
large the same as that of the last quarter. In contrast, there has been a sharp 
decline in Future Expectations Index due to all constituent factors. 
The four surveys were first published as part of Macroeconomic and Monetary 
Developments: Second Quarter Review 2012-13 on October 29, 2012.
