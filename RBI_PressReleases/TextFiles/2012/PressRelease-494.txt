The Reserve Bank of India has constituted a high level Financial Inclusion 
Advisory Committee (FIAC) to spearhead the efforts towards greater financial 
inclusion. The collective expertise and experience of the members of the committee 
is expected to explore issues such as developing viable and sustainable banking 
services delivery models focussing on accessible and affordable financial services, 
developing products and processes for rural as well as urban consumers presently 
outside the banking network and suggest appropriate regulatory framework to 
ensure that financial inclusion and financial stability move in tandem. 
The Committee will be chaired by Dr. K.C. Chakrabarty, Deputy Governor, 
Reserve Bank of India and will comprise of the following members:- 
a) Shri Y.H. Malegam, Member, Central Board of Directors, Reserve Bank 
of India  
b) Professor Dipankar Gupta, Member, Central Board of Directors, Reserve 
Bank of India

Executive Director in-charge of Rural Planning and Credit Department, 
Reserve Bank of India will be the Convenor of the Committee and the Rural Planning 
and Credit Department, Central Office, Reserve Bank of India will provide the 
Secretariat to the Committee. 
It may be mentioned that there has been significant, albeit slow, progress 
towards greater financial Inclusion. However, ensuring accessible and affordable 
financial services in all 6 lakh villages in India is a herculean task and given the 
enormity of the task, a lot of ground still needs to be covered.  This calls for a 
partnership of all the stakeholders – Reserve Bank, other sectoral regulators like 
Securities and Exchange Board of India, Insurance Regulatory and Development 
Authority, Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority, National Bank for 
Agriculture and Rural Development; Banks; Governments; Civil Society; Non-
Governmental Organisations, etc.   
While the regulators and the Government of India are already part of the 
Technical Group on Financial Inclusion and Literacy of the Sub-committee of the 
Financial Stability & Development Council, a need was felt to engage the members 
from the civil society/Non-Governmental Organisations and others for a sound and 
purposeful collaboration. The Committee, if necessary, would call other market 
players like Corporate Business Correspondents, Technology Vendors etc., as 
special invitees to the meetings. Since the financial inclusion model selected in India 
is primarily bank-led, the Financial Inclusion Advisory Committee may also invite the 
Chairperson/Managing Directors of banks to each of its meetings to gather the 
perspective of the banks.
