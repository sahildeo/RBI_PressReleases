            RBI study on FDI Flows to India  
 
 An analysis of the recent trends in foreign direct investment (FDI) flows at the 
global level as well as across regions/countries suggests that India has generally 
attracted higher FDI flows in line with its robust domestic economic performance and 
gradual liberalisation of the FDI policy as part of the cautious capital account 
liberalisation process. Even during the recent global crisis, FDI inflows to India did 
not show as much moderation as was the case at the global level as well as in other 
EMEs. However, when the global FDI flows to Emerging Market Economies (EMEs) 
recovered during 2010-11, FDI flows to India remained sluggish despite relatively 
better domestic economic performance ahead of global recovery. This raised 
questions especially in the backdrop of the widening of the current account deficit 
beyond the sustainable level of about 3 per cent. 
 
Using Kauffmann’s Index, the Reserve Bank of India conducted an empirical 
exercise to analyse the factors behind such moderation. The study suggested that 
institutional factors, such as, policy uncertainty, are causing the slowdown in FDI 
inflows to India despite robustness of macroeconomic variables. A panel exercise for 
10 major EMEs showed that FDI was significantly influenced by openness, growth 
prospects, macroeconomic sustainability, labour cost and uncertainty in government 
policy. A comparison of actual FDI flows to India vis-à-vis the potential level worked 
out on the basis of underlying macroeconomic fundamentals showed that actual FDI 
which generally tracked the potential level till 2009-10, fell short of its potential during 
2010-11. Further, counter factual scenario attempted to segregate economic and 
non-economic factors seemed to suggest that the divergence between actual and 
potential during 2010-11 could partly be on account of policy uncertainty.
