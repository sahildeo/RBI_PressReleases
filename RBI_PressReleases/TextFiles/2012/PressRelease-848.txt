RBI releases Report of Working Group on Enhancing Liquidity in  
Government Securities and Interest Rate Derivatives Markets  
 
The Reserve Bank of India today, placed on its website, the report of the Working 
Group on Enhancing Liquidity in Government Securities and Interest Rate 
Derivatives markets. The Group has made various recommendations, which have 
been categorised into essential recommendations, desirable recommendations and 
operational recommendations. Some of the important recommendations made by the 
Group are: 
 
(a) Government Securities Market 
• Consolidation of outstanding Government securities, based on model plan 
indicated in the report; 
• Allocation of specific securities to each Primary Dealer for market making in them; 
• Gradual increase in the investment limit for Foreign Institutional Investors in 
Government securities keeping in view the country’s overall external debt position, 
current account deficit, size of Government’s borrowing programme, etc.; 
• A roadmap to gradually bring down the upper-limit on the Held-to-Maturity portfolio 
in a calibrated manner to make it non-disruptive to the entities and other 
stakeholders may be prepared; and 
•  Promotion of the term-repo market with suitable restrictions on ‘leverage’ and 
introduction of tripartite repo in Government securities. 
 
(b) Retail Participation 
• Services of banks (and post offices if possible at a later stage and in consultation 
with Government of India) may be utilised as a distribution channel and nodal point 
for interface with individual investors; and 
• A centralised market maker for retail participants in Government securities in the 
long-term who would quote two-way prices of Government securities for 
retail/individual investors may be considered. 
?null???????null????? 
(c) Interest Rate Derivatives Market 
• An electronic swap execution facility (electronic trading platform) for the Interest 
Rate Swap (IRS) market may be introduced with a Central Counter Party 
mechanism for guaranteed settlement through the electronic platform; 
• Insurance companies, Provident Funds and other financially sound entities be 
permitted to participate in IRS market; 
• Futures contracts that have high probability of attracting participant interest, such 
as Interest Rate Futures (IRF)  based on overnight call borrowing rate to be 
introduced; and 
• Cash-settled 10-year IRF subject to appropriate regulations like restricted 
participation, entity-based open position limit, price band, etc., to be introduced. 
 
The Reserve Bank would examine and initiate appropriate action on the 
recommendations made by the Working Group.
