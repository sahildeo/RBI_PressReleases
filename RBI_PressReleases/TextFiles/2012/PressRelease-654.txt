Mid-Quarter Monetary Policy Review: September 2012 
Monetary and Liquidity Measures 
 On the basis of an assessment of the current macroeconomic situation, it has 
been decided to:  
• reduce the cash reserve ratio (CRR) of scheduled banks by 25 basis points 
from 4.75 per cent to 4.50 per cent of their net demand and time liabilities 
(NDTL) effective the fortnight beginning September 22, 2012. Consequently, 
around ` 170 billion of primary liquidity will be injected into the banking 
system; and  
• keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) 
unchanged at 8.0 per cent. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the 
LAF will remain unchanged at 7.0 per cent, and the marginal standing facility 
(MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 9.0 per cent 
Introduction 
2.  There have been several significant developments since the Reserve Bank’s 
First Quarter Review of Monetary Policy in July. Globally, as risks have risen, both 
the European Central Bank (ECB) and the US Fed have responded with liquidity 
measures intended to calm financial markets and provide further stimulus to 
economic activity. While these measures have certainly mitigated short-term growth 
and financial risks, they will also exert pressure on global asset prices, and 
particularly, commodity prices. Domestically, growth continues to be weak amidst a 
negative investment climate; however, the recent reform measures undertaken by 
the Government have started to reverse sentiments. The Government undertook 
long anticipated measures towards fiscal consolidation by reducing fuel subsidies 
and selling stakes in public enterprises. Further, steps taken to increase foreign 
direct investment (FDI) should contribute to both greater capital inflows and, over the 
long run, higher productivity, particularly in the food supply chain. Importantly, 
however, for the moment, inflationary pressures, both at wholesale and retail levels, 
are still strong.    
3.  In April, the Reserve Bank implemented a frontloaded policy rate reduction of 
50 basis points on the expectations of fiscal policy support for inflation management 
alongside supply-side initiatives for addressing the deceleration of investment and 
growth. As these expectations did not materialise and inflation remained firmly above 
7.5 per cent, the Reserve Bank decided to pause in its policy easing in the Mid-
?null???????null?????2 
 
Quarter Review (MQR) of June and in the First Quarter Review (FQR) of July. As 
inflationary tendencies have persisted, the primary focus of monetary policy remains 
the containment of inflation and anchoring of inflation expectations. In this context, 
the Government’s recent actions have paved the way for a more favourable growth-
inflation dynamic by initiating a shift in expenditure away from consumption 
(subsidies) and towards investment (including through FDI). Of course, several 
challenges remain, one of which is persistent inflation. But, as policy actions to 
stimulate growth materialize, monetary policy will reinforce the positive impact of 
these actions while maintaining its focus on inflation management. Only this will 
ensure that the economy derives the maximum benefit from the recent, and 
anticipated, fiscal and supply-side policy measures.  
Global Economy  
4.  Global activity has been weakening in Q3 of 2012. Merchandise trade slowed 
considerably with absolute contractions in major economies. Global purchasing 
managers’ indices (PMI) point to contraction in manufacturing and only modest 
growth in services. Persistent sovereign debt pressures amidst weakening economic 
activity in the euro area pose significant downside risks to the global economy. 
These concerns have prompted the announcement of the programme of outright 
monetary transactions (OMTs) in the form of sovereign bond purchases by the ECB. 
The US Fed  announced the purchase of additional agency mortgage-backed 
securities until labour market conditions improve substantially, and extended 
exceptional policy accommodation till mid-2015.  
5.  Growth in several major emerging and developing economies (EDEs) is also 
moderating, with China’s Q2 2012 growth slowing to its lowest rate in the past three 
years. Slowing global demand has adversely affected industrial activity and exports 
in these economies. Additionally, drought conditions in major grain-producing areas 
of the world and the possibility of further hardening of international crude prices in 
view of the fresh dose of quantitative easing impart ubiquitous risks to overall global 
macroeconomic prospects.  
Domestic Economy 
Growth
6.  Economic activity picked up modestly in Q1 of 2012-13 in relation to the 
preceding quarter; but the sluggish momentum of value added in Q1 was evident 
across all sectors of the economy, and particularly in industry. Lead indicators point 
to slack activity in Q2 as well. Industrial production rose by just 0.1 per cent in July. 
In August, the manufacturing PMI fell to its lowest level during 2012 so far, as a 
result of output disruptions due to power shortages and declining export orders. The 
services PMI, however, picked up in August on growth in new orders and 
employment. With the progressive reduction in the rainfall deficit, kharif sowing, 
though still below normal, has improved. Reassuringly, the late rains have 
augmented storage in reservoirs which should improve prospects for the rabi crop, 
mitigating to some extent the concerns about agricultural prospects.  
Inflation 
7.  Headline WPI inflation (y-o-y) has remained sticky at around 7.5 per cent 
throughout the current financial year so far. At the disaggregated level, within 
primary food articles, the easing of vegetable prices in July-August was to a large 3 
 
extent offset by the surge in prices of cereals and pulses. Demand-supply 
imbalances in respect of protein-rich items persist. Fuel price inflation picked up in 
August, largely reflecting the upward revision in electricity prices. As welcome as the 
recent hike in diesel prices/rationalisation of LPG subsidy has been, the pass-
through to administered prices remains incomplete. International crude prices are 
vulnerable to being driven up further by global liquidity. Core inflation pressures 
remained firm with non-food manufactured products inflation inching up from 5.1 per 
cent in April to 5.6 per cent in August and the momentum indicator remaining 
elevated. Even as demand pressures moderate, supply constraints and rupee 
depreciation are imparting pressures on prices, rendering them sticky.  
8.  In terms of the new CPI, inflation (y-o-y) remained broadly unchanged in July 
from June at close to 10 per cent, held up by rising prices of food items.  
Notwithstanding some easing in July, core CPI inflation (CPI excluding food and fuel 
sub-group) remains elevated.  
9.  While the recent upward revision in diesel prices and rationalisation of subsidy 
for LPG is a significant achievement, in the short-term, there will be pressures on 
headline inflation. Over the medium-term, however, it will strengthen macroeconomic 
fundamentals.  It is important to note that these revisions were anticipated at the time 
of the April policy when a front-loaded repo rate reduction was undertaken.  Over the 
longer run, holding down subsidies to under 2 per cent of GDP as indicated in the 
Union Budget for 2012-13 is crucial to manage demand-side pressures on inflation. 
Containing inflationary pressures and lowering inflation expectations warrant 
maintaining the momentum of recent policy actions to step up investment, alleviate 
supply constraints, and improve productivity. 
Liquidity Conditions 
10.  Money supply (M ), bank credit and deposits have moderated in relation to 
3
their indicative trajectories, reflecting the slowing down of economic activity. Against 
this backdrop, liquidity conditions have remained comfortable since the FQR. 
However, going forward, the wedge between deposit growth and credit growth could 
widen on the back of the seasonal pick-up in credit demand in the second half of the 
year. This, combined with outflows on account of advance tax payments and the 
onset of festival-related currency demand, could accentuate pressures on liquidity 
over the next few weeks. In these conditions, appropriate liquidity management 
assumes importance in order to ensure that drawals under the Liquidity Adjustment 
Facility (LAF) broadly remain within the indicative target of +/- 1 percent of NDTL, 
thereby facilitating monetary policy transmission and enabling adequate flow of credit 
to the productive sectors of the economy.   
External sector 
11.  While the trade deficit narrowed in the first five months of 2012-13, the 
relatively large fall of exports in July-August is indicative of risks to the current 
account from the worsening global outlook. As regards external financing, the 
moderation in FDI inflows was partly compensated by a surge in non-resident 
deposits and a renewal of FIIs flows in recent months. Consequently, the rupee has 
been trading in a narrow range since the FQR. Looking ahead, a moderation in the 
trade deficit combined with increased inflows in response to domestic policy 
developments could ease pressures on the balance of payments. However,   risks 
from global factors, in terms of both capital movements and oil prices will persist. 
Given these external risks, holding down the CAD to sustainable levels will depend 4 
 
on durable fiscal consolidation and, in particular, switching public expenditure from 
subsidies to capital outlay that crowds in private investment, thus preparing the 
ground for a revival of growth. 
Guidance 
12.  Since the FQR, while growth risks have increased, inflation risks remain. 
Mitigating the growth risks and taking the economy to a higher sustainable growth 
trajectory requires concerted policy action across a range of domains, a process to 
which last week’s actions made a significant contribution. Monetary policy also has 
an important role in supporting the growth revival. However, in the current situation, 
persistent inflationary pressures alongside risks emerging from twin deficits – current 
account deficit and fiscal deficit - constrain a stronger response of monetary policy to 
growth risks. Accordingly, as this process evolves, the stance of monetary policy will 
be conditioned by careful and continuous monitoring of the evolving growth-inflation 
dynamic, management of liquidity conditions to ensure adequate flows of credit to 
productive sectors and appropriate responses to shocks emanating from external 
developments.
