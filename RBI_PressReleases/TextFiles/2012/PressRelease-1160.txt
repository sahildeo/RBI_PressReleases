RBI Working Paper Series 10 / 2012 
Systemic Liquidity Index for India 
The Reserve Bank of India today placed on its website a Working Paper titled 
“Systemic Liquidity Index for India”. The Working Paper has been written by Dr. Rabi 
N. Mishra, Shri G. Jagan Mohan and Shri Sanjay Singh.  
Liquidity stress is at the heart of any banking crisis. Liquidity risk, when not 
managed properly at individual institutions, could lead to a more serious problem – of 
solvency. The paper seeks to define the various elements of what is loosely referred 
to as liquidity. It describes the various types of liquidity that the term denotes, among 
other things, funding and market liquidity. 
Systemic risk is influenced by systemic liquidity, a broader term that 
encompasses the liquidity scenario in the banking sector, non-banking financial 
sector, the corporate sector and prevailing foreign currency liquidity conditions. The 
paper introduces a Systemic Liquidity Index (SLI) for India which captures funding 
liquidity conditions in all major financial markets. Based on four indicators, whose 
coverage extends to funding markets of banks, non-banks and the corporate sector, 
the SLI has been constructed using four different methodologies based on relative 
distance method, standard normal or variance-equal method, principal component 
analysis method and rank percentile method. Of these four, the paper adopts the 
most appropriate one, namely, variance-equal method, which is widely used 
internationally.  
A single indicator based on call rate can also be used as an index of liquidity 
strains. However, such an index provides signals relating to the liquidity conditions in 
respect of banks alone. The SLI developed, using multiple indicators, is more 
comprehensive representing funding liquidity conditions in the entire system as 
against a single one. It is easy to compute as it uses standard statistical techniques 
and daily market data and could prove useful to monitor trends in systemic liquidity 
conditions. The SLI, so developed, is appropriately validated for its function as a 
metric for measuring systemic liquidity and its implications on the banks’ 
performance. 
The Reserve Bank of India introduced the RBI Working Papers series in 
March 2011. These papers present research in progress of the staff members of RBI 
and are disseminated to elicit comments and further debate. The views expressed in 
these papers are those of authors and not that of the Reserve Bank of India. 
Comments and observations may please be forwarded to authors. Citation and use 
of such papers should take into account its provisional character.
