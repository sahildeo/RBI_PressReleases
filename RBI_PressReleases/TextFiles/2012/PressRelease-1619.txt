RBI’s International Seminar on  
“Operationalising Tools for Macro-Financial Surveillance:  
Country Experiences” 
 
          The Reserve Bank of India (Financial Stability Unit) organised an International 
Seminar on April 03-04, 2012.  The theme of the Seminar was “Operationalising 
Tools for Macro-Financial Surveillance: Country Experiences”. The Seminar 
facilitated cross fertilisation of ideas on the tools and techniques being deployed 
globally for the identification, assessment and mitigation of risks to financial stability.  
 
           The Seminar was inaugurated by Dr. K. C. Chakrabarty, Deputy Governor, 
and was attended by senior financial stability functionaries from several countries, 
namely, Canada, Chile, England, France, Finland, Germany, Italy, Korea, Mexico, 
Nepal, Norway, Poland, Russia, Sri Lanka and Turkey. Senior representatives from 
international multilateral institutions, namely, International Monetary Fund and 
Financial Stability Board, also attended the Seminar.  
                                                         
           The Seminar was organised against the backdrop of the 2007-09 global 
financial crisis which underscored the need for greater attention to systemic risk 
assessment and on crisis prevention. Post the crisis, pursuit of financial stability has 
emerged as a key policy objective of central bankers and financial sector policy 
makers across the globe. The cornerstone for the pursuit of financial stability is a 
framework for macro financial surveillance of the economy.
