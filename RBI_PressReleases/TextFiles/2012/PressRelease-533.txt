country. 
? The Reserve Bank will also prepare a position paper on education loans across the 
country. 
? The Reserve Bank Governor urged the administration and banks in the Union 
Territory of Puducherry to make financial inclusion more meaningful. This would

and remittance facilities as well.

government schemes directly to bank accounts of the beneficiaries, to enable 
payment of taxes through e-payment. They will also jointly conduct a campaign to 
make farmers aware of the benefits of obtaining crop insurance.
