The Central Board meets at least once every quarter. Apart from holding 
meetings in Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata and one in New Delhi after the Union Budget 
which is addressed by the Finance Minister, the rest of the meetings are held in other 
state capitals by rotation. The main function of the Central Board of Directors of the 
Reserve Bank is to provide overall direction to the Reserve Bank’s affairs. 
Later, at a State Level Bankers Committee (SLBC) meeting State level issues of 
mutual interest were discussed. The meeting was attended by state government officials 
led by Dr. Amit Mitra, Finance Minister of West Bengal, CMDs of public sector banks 
headquartered in Kolkata and other senior bankers. The RBI team was led by the 
Governor and the Deputy Governors. After detailed discussions, it was agreed that 
banks will endeavour to achieve CD ratio of 65 per cent in the State during financial year 
2012-13 and increase it further to 68 per cent in financial years 2013-14. Further, banks 
will endeavour to increase the CD ratio by at least 5 per cent in ten identified districts 
with less than 40 per cent CD ratio. These were Burdwan, Bankura, Birbhum, Hoogly, 
Murshidabad, Nadia, Purulia, 24 Parganas (North), 24 Parganas (South) and Paschim 
Midnapur.  
At her meeting with the Governor held later today, the Chief Minister of West 
Bengal agreed to preside over a meeting of District Magistrates, bankers, Reserve Bank 
of India and NABARD to work out an action plan to improve the CD ratio in these 
districts.  
It was also decided in the SLBC meeting that the State government and banks 
will work towards operationalising the electronic benefit transfer (EBT) on pilot basis in 
six districts from March 1, 2013. Banks were also advised to provide linkage to additional 
1.5 lakh self help groups (SHGs) for extension of credit. Banks have already provided 
such a linkage to over 90,000 SHGs in Kolkata during the last year.
