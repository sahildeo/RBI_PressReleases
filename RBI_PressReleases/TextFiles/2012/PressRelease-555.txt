A Profile of Banks : 2011-12 
The Reserve Bank of India today placed on its website the publication ‘A 
Profile of Banks: 2011-12’. The publication, being eighth volume in the series, 
provides bank-wise and bank group-wise information on important performance 
indicators of all scheduled commercial banks (SCBs), excluding regional rural banks, 
for the period 2007-08 to 2011-12. The publication covers 18 important indicators, 
including return on assets (RoA), capital to risk weighted assets ratio (CRAR), 
business per employee, and profit per employee.   
Highlights 
• Employee productivity in terms of both business per employee and profit per 
employee in all SCBs at aggregate level increased continuously in all the 
financial years during the period 2007-08 to 2011-12.  
• Profitability in terms of RoA of all SCBs at the aggregate level declined in 2011-
12 as compared to the previous financial year whereas the cost of funds and 
net NPA ratio increased. 
• CRAR of all SCBs increased at the end of 2011-12. 
• Bank group wise analysis revealed that business per employee across all bank 
groups increased during 2011-12 vis-à-vis that in 2010-11. Profit per employee 
also increased across all bank groups except in respect of ‘nationalised banks’ 
group during 2011-12. For ‘nationalised banks’ group, profit per employee in 
2011-12 remained the same as that in 2010-11.  
• RoA increased in all bank groups in 2011-12, except for ‘nationalised banks’. 
• Cost of funds increased in all the bank groups in 2011-12. 
• CRAR of all bank groups at aggregate level declined at the end of 2011-12 
except in ‘SBI and its associate bank’ group. 
• Net NPA ratios in all bank groups increased in 2011-12 except in ‘new private 
sector banks’ and ‘foreign banks’ groups.
