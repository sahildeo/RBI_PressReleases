RBI Working Paper Series 14 / 2012 
 
Determinants of Liquidity and the Relationship between  
Liquidity and Money: A Primer 
The Reserve Bank of India today placed on its website a Working Paper titled 
“Determinants of Liquidity and the Relationship between Liquidity and Money:           
A Primer”. The Working paper has been written by Shri A.K. Mitra and                     
Ms. Abhilasha. 
The paper studies the determinants of liquidity and the interactions between 
liquidity and money and is intended as a primer. A number of interactions between 
central bank operations and their effects on base money and money supply are 
represented through stylized balance sheet representation and charts depicting the 
actual data. The continued importance of money in an interest rate targeting 
operating framework is discussed. The authors find that tests based on Granger 
causality do not give any clear indication of money supply being fully endogenous. 
The paper  concludes that the impact of liquidity management operations of the 
Reserve Bank may not always have the desired impact on money supply due to the 
changing behavior of the public and commercial banks, leading to episodes of 
endogeneity of money supply.  
The Reserve Bank of India introduced the RBI Working Papers series in 
March 2011. These papers present research in progress of the staff members of RBI 
and are disseminated to elicit comments and further debate. The views expressed in 
these papers are those of authors and not that of the Reserve Bank of India. 
Comments and observations may kindly be forwarded to authors. Citation and use of 
such papers should take into account its provisional character.
