Quarterly Order Books, Inventories and Capacity Utilization Survey 
October-December 2011 (Round 16) 
The Reserve Bank of India has launched the sixteenth round of its Order 
Books, Inventories and Capacity Utilization Survey (OBICUS). The survey is for the 
reference period October-December 2011.  
The Reserve Bank has been conducting Order Books, Inventories and 
Capacity Utilization Survey (OBICUS) of the manufacturing sector regularly on a 
quarterly basis. The survey captures quantitative data on new orders received during 
the reference quarter, backlog orders at the beginning of the quarter, pending orders 
at the end of the quarter, total inventories with breakup of work-in-progress and 
finished goods inventories at the end of the quarter and item-wise production in 
terms of quantity and values during the quarter vis-à-vis the installed capacity from a 
targeted group of manufacturing companies. The information on installed capacity, 
quantity produced, value of production, etc., are used for calculating the capacity 
utilization at industry as well as at an all India level. The survey has been providing a 
significant input to the Reserve Bank in monetary policy formulation.  
 The salient features of this survey results at the aggregate level are published 
in Monthly Bulletin of the Reserve Bank. The article on 14th round of the survey has 
been published in the December 2011 issue of the Bulletin under the title “Quarterly 
Order Books, Inventories and Capacity Utilization Survey: April-June 2011 (14th 
Round). The article can also be viewed or downloaded from the RBI website 
http://www.rbi.org.in. 
M/s Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy Pvt. Ltd. (CMIE), Mumbai, has 
been mandated to conduct the survey for this quarter on behalf of the Reserve Bank 
of India. The major manufacturing companies will be approached by the agency 
during the quarter. Other manufacturing companies that are not approached by the 
agency can also participate in this survey round by downloading the survey schedule 
from the Reserve Bank’s website www.rbi.org.in. The survey schedule is placed 
under the Forms and subhead Survey. The duly authenticated filled-in survey 
schedule may be e-mailed or faxed to the agency as per contact details provided in
