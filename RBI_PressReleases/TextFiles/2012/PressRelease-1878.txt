RBI Releases Draft Guidelines on Liquidity Risk Management and Basel III 
Framework on Liquidity Standards 
 
The Reserve Bank of India today released on its website, Draft Guidelines on 
Liquidity Risk Management and Basel III Framework on Liquidity Standards for 
comments and feedback.  
 
To address the deficiencies witnessed in liquidity risk management in the 
recent crisis and to strengthen liquidity risk management in banks, the Basel 
Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) published “Principles for Sound Liquidity 
Risk Management and Supervision” in September 2008. This was followed by the 
publication of “Basel III: International framework for liquidity risk measurement, 
standards and monitoring” in December 2010 i.e., the Basel III rules text on liquidity 
prescribing two minimum global regulatory standards viz. liquidity coverage ratio 
(LCR) and net stable funding ratio (NSFR) for liquidity risk and a set of five 
monitoring tools.  
 
The Reserve Bank, being a member of the BCBS, is fully committed to the 
objective of the Basel III reform package and, therefore, intends to implement these 
proposals for banks operating in India. Accordingly, draft guidelines on Liquidity Risk 
Management and Basel III Framework on Liquidity Standards have been prepared.   
 
The draft guidelines have been presented in two sections viz., Section I and II. 
Section I consolidates the various instructions/guidance on liquidity risk management 
that the Reserve Bank of India has issued from time to time in the past, and where 
appropriate, harmonizes and enhances these instructions/guidance in line with the 
BCBS’s Principles for Sound Liquidity Risk Management and Supervision. Section II 
covers the Basel III guidelines on liquidity risk as will be applicable to the Indian 
banks.  Two minimum global regulatory standards viz. LCR and NSFR as set out in 
the Basel III rules text issued by the BCBS in December 2010 have been prescribed 
under the guidelines which will become binding from 1 January 2015 and 1 January 
2018, respectively. Till then, these guidelines have been issued for compliance on 
best effort basis. Banks are expected to submit the liquidity returns under the Basel 
III framework to the Reserve Bank from the month /quarter ending June 2012.  
  
Comments/feedback on the draft guidelines may please be forwarded to the 
Chief General Manager-in-Charge, Department of Banking Operations and 
Development, Reserve Bank of India, Central Office Building, 12th Floor, S.B. Singh
