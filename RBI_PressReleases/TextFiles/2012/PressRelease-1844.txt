Background   
The Reserve Bank of India has been conducting Inflation Expectations Survey 
of Households (IESH) on a quarterly basis since September 2005. The Survey seeks 
qualitative responses from households on price changes (general prices as well as 
prices of specific product groups) in the next three months as well as in the next one 
year and quantitative responses on current, three-month ahead and one-year ahead 
inflation rates. The results of this Survey are used by the Reserve Bank as an 
important input to monetary policy formulation.  Inflation expectations are subjective 
assessments of around 4,000 households across 12 cities proposed to be covered in 
the Survey round and are based on households’ individual consumption baskets.
