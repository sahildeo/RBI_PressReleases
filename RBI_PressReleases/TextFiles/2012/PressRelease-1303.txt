RBI launches the 28 Round of Inflation  
Expectations Survey of Households 
 Reserve Bank of India has been conducting Inflation Expectations Survey of 
Households (IESH) on a quarterly basis since September 2005. The 28th round of 
the Survey with April-June 2012 as the current reference period has been launched 
today. The Survey seeks qualitative responses from households on price changes 
(general prices as well as prices of specific product groups) in the next three months 
as well as in the next one year and quantitative responses on current, three-month 
ahead and one-year ahead inflation rates. The results of this Survey are being used 
by Reserve Bank as one of the important inputs to the monetary policy formulation.   
 Inflation expectations are subjective assessments of around 4,000 
households across 12 cities proposed to be covered in the Survey round and are 
based on households’ individual consumption baskets.  
 The agency M/s Beaumont Consultancy Services, Mumbai has been engaged 
to conduct this round of the Survey on behalf of the Reserve Bank of India. For this 
purpose, the households will be approached by the agency during the survey period 
and the selected households are requested to provide their response. In case of any 
query/clarification, kindly contact at the following address:
