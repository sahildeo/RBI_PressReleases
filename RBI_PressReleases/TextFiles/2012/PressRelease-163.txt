RBI Working Paper Series 17 / 2012 
Asset Liability Mismatches (ALMi) in the Indian Banking Sector 
  – The Extent, Persistence and Reasons 
The Reserve Bank of India today placed on its website a Working Paper titled 
"Asset Liability Mismatches (ALMi) in the Indian Banking Sector – The Extent, 
Persistence and Reasons".  The Working Paper has been authored by Smt. Rakhe 
P.B.  
During the recent years, there has been a consistent increase in the 
infrastructure loan portfolio of the Indian banking sector. This raises some concern 
with regard to ALMi as the Indian banking sector primarily depends on short-term 
deposits for financing the long-term loan requirements. This prompted the study to 
analyse the extent, persistence and probable reasons of ALMi positive gap in the 
Indian banking sector.  
The study finds that the Indian banking sector created ALMi positive gap in 
the long-term buckets to the extent of 14 per cent of total long-term assets during the 
period under study. Further, the ALMi positive gap was the highest in the ‘more than 
five years’ category as compared to other long-term buckets. However, the ALMi 
positive gap was not significantly persistent at the aggregate level. The probable 
factors resulting in ALMi include low growth in long-term deposits, high growth in 
long-term loans, high responsiveness of long-term loans to output gap, and 
insignificant responsiveness of long-term deposits to output gap.  
The study opines that it may not be prudent to eliminate ALMi positive gap 
from the banking sector as credit intermediation is essentially the transformation of 
maturity and liquidity. However, there is a need to limit it at tolerable levels to 
safeguard the financial soundness of the banking sector. It may be important to 
develop other avenues of financing the long-term loan requirements of the economy 
to limit the burden on the banks. Banks, on the other hand, may also try to mobilise 
more long-term deposits to expand the prudent lending limit of long-term loans.
