Do not respond to Mails asking for your Internet Banking Account Details :  
RBI Cautions Public 
 It has come to the notice of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) that a fraudulent 
email has been sent and signed in its name as `Reserve Bank of India'. The mail has 
referred to provisions of Banking Regulation act, 1949 and Prevention of Money 
Laundering Rules, 2005 and informs bank account holders about the Reserve Bank 
setting up a new 24x7 Centralised Monitoring Centre to monitor financial transaction 
flow from the Internet Banking Accounts. The email then gives a link asking bank 
account holders to update their account information for updation in their database.  
 The Reserve Bank clarifies that it has not sent any such mail and has not set 
up any 24x7 Centralised Monitoring Centre to monitor financial transaction flow from 
the Internet Banking Accounts. Members of the public receiving such emails are 
cautioned not to open the mail or attachment and / or try to download it on their 
computer or provide their data on such links as it may lead to their data being 
compromised.
