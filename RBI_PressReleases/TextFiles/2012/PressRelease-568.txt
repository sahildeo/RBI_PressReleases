India’s External Debt as at the end of June 2012 
The current account deficit was largely financed through debt flows with 
continued uncertainty in the global economy affecting the quantum of equity flows 
during the first quarter of 2012-13. However, the magnitude of increase in external 
debt was lower than that of the preceding quarter largely due to valuation gains 
resulting from appreciation of US dollar against Indian rupee and other international 
currencies.  
The major developments relating to India’s external debt as at end-June 2012 
are set out below: 
(i) India’s external debt, as at end-June 2012, was placed at US$ 349.5 billion 
showing an increase of US$ 3.9 billion or 1.1 per cent over the level at end-
March 2012. The increase in total external debt during the quarter was primarily 
on account of rise in Non-resident external rupee denominated ((NR(E) RA) 
deposits, reflecting the impact of deregulation of interest rates in these deposits 
in December 2011. There has been sizeable rise in short-term trade credit as 
well.   
(ii) Excluding the valuation gains due to the appreciation of the US dollar against 
Indian rupee and other international currencies, the external debt as at end-
June would have increased by US $ 11.8 billion over end-March 2012. 
(iii) In terms of major components, the share of external commercial borrowings 
(ECB) continued to be the highest at 30.0 per cent of total external debt, 
followed by NRI deposits (17.4 per cent) and multilateral debt (14.2 per cent).   
(iv) Based on residual maturity, short-term debt accounted for 42.9 per cent of the 
total external debt as at end-June 2012. Of this, the share of NRI deposits was 
28.8 per cent. The share of short-term debt in total debt, by original maturity, 
was 23.0 per cent.  
(v) The ratio of short-term debt (original maturity) to foreign exchange reserves 
rose to 27.8 per cent as at end-June 2012 from 26.6 per cent as at end-March 
2012. 
(vi) The debt denominated in US dollar continued to be the highest with a share of 
56.3 per cent in total external debt as at end-June 2012 followed by the Indian 
rupee (21.4 per cent) and Japanese Yen (9.1 per cent).

(vii) The ratio of foreign exchange reserves to external debt as at end June 2012 at 
82.9 per cent was lower than the level of end-March 2012. 
1. India’s External Debt as at end-June 2012 
India’s external debt, as at end-June 2012, was placed at US$ 349.5 billion  
showing an increase of US$ 3.9 billion or 1.1 per cent over the end-March 2012 level 
primarily on account of Non-resident external rupee ((NR(E) RA) denominated 
deposits and short-term trade credits (Table 1). Significantly, the stock of multilateral 
debt and ECB at the end of June 2012 was lower than that of the level at end of 
March 2012. The decline in the stock of ECB was mainly due to higher repayments 
during the quarter.

The share of short-term debt in total debt rose over the preceding as well as 
corresponding quarter of the previous year.  The long-term debt at US$ 269.1 billion 
and short-term debt at US$ 80.5 billion accounted for 77.0 per cent and 23.0 per 
cent, respectively, of the total external debt as at end-June 2012 (Table 2). Although, 
widening CAD was largely financed through debt flows, rise in magnitude of debt 
over the preceding quarter has been relatively moderate as a part of the rise was 
offset by valuation gains.

2. Valuation Changes 
The valuation gain during the first quarter of 2012-13 amounted to US$ 7.9 
billion reflecting the appreciation of US dollar against the Indian rupee and other major 
currencies. Thus excluding the valuation gains the stock of external debt as at end-
June 2012 would have increased by 11.8 billion. 
3. Currency Composition of India’s External Debt 
The US Dollar denominated debt continued to be the largest with a share of 
56.3  per cent in the total external debt as at end-June 2012 followed by Indian rupee 
(21.4 per cent), Japanese yen (9.1 per cent), SDR (8.3 per cent) and Euro (3.3 per 
cent)  
 4. External Debt by Residual Maturity 
Based on residual maturity, the short-term debt accounted for 42.9 per cent of 
total external debt as at end-June 2012. Within the short-term debt, the share of NRI 
deposits was the highest at 28.8 per cent. The ratio of short-term debt by residual 
maturity to foreign exchange reserves worked out to 51.8 per cent at end-June 2012 
(Table 3).

6. Select Indicators of External Debt 
Among the indicators of external debt considered for assessing vulnerability, 
almost all the indicators showed some deterioration as at end-June 2012 as compared 
to end-March 2012. Debt service ratio, however, showed a tad better during the first 
quarter 2012-13 than 2011-12 (Table 5).
