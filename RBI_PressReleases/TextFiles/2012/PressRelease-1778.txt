RBI Announces Reduction in the CRR 
Monetary/Liquidity Measures  
It has been decided to: 
• reduce the cash reserve ratio (CRR) of scheduled banks by 75 basis points 
from 5.5 per cent to 4.75 per cent of their net demand and time liabilities 
(NDTL) effective the fortnight beginning March 10, 2012.  
This reduction will inject around `480 billion of primary liquidity into the banking 
system. 
In order to mitigate tight liquidity conditions, the cash reserve ratio was reduced 
by 50 basis points in the Third Quarter Review (TQR) of January 2012, injecting 
primary liquidity of `315 billion into the banking system. The Reserve Bank also 
continued with the open market operations (OMOs), injecting primary liquidity of over 
`1,245 billion this financial year so far, of which `528 billion was injected after the 
TQR. 
Despite these measures, the liquidity deficit has remained large on account of 
both structural and frictional factors. This was reflected in the net average borrowing 
under the Reserve Bank's liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) rising from an average of 
`1,292 billion in January 2012 to `1,405 billion in February. Net injection of liquidity 
through LAF rose to a peak of `1,917 billion on March 1, 2012, though subsequently 
it declined to `1,273 billion on March 7, 2012. 
Further, the liquidity deficit is expected to increase significantly during the 
second week of March due to advance tax outflows and the usual frontloading of 
cash balances by banks with the Reserve Bank. Thus, the overall deficit in the 
system persists above the comfort level of the Reserve Bank. Accordingly, it has 
been decided to inject permanent primary liquidity into the system by reducing the 
CRR so as to ensure smooth flow of credit to productive sectors of the economy.  
As already announced, the Reserve Bank will provide its assessment of the 
macroeconomic situation in its Mid-Quarter Review to be published on March 15, 
2012.
