About Bhubaneswar Office 
 
Beginning with a lone Agricultural Credit Department of the Reserve Bank in 
1962 in a rented house on Lewis Road, Bhubaneswar, completed its 50 years of 
existence in the state of Odisha. With the opening of new departments, the 
Bhubaneswar Office moved from Lewis Road to Bapuji Nagar in 1965 and from 
Bapuji Nagar to Station square in 1969. The Office shifted to the State Co-operative 
Bank Building and State Archives Building in 1972 when the office started to operate 
as a full-fledged Regional Office of the Reserve Bank of India. The Office shifted to 
the new and the present premises in Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru Marg in 1982.
