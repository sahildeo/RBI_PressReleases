RBI Working Paper Series : 6 / 2012 
Evidence of Interest Rate Channel of Monetary Policy Transmission in India 
How interest rate actions and liquidity operations of the central banks impact 
desired objectives of monetary policy in terms of inflation and growth depends on the 
underlying monetary transmission. During last two decades, substantial research 
efforts have been devoted to understanding the monetary transmission mechanism, 
especially in developed nations. In the absence of any unique mechanism, several 
theories have been postulated and multiple channels are observed in the literature. 
However, such exploration has been limited in emerging economies. In this context, 
this paper provides empirical evidence of interest rate channel of monetary policy in 
India.  
With the development of domestic financial markets and gradual deregulation 
of interest rates, monetary policy operating procedure in India in the recent years has 
evolved towards greater reliance on interest rates to signal the stance of monetary 
policy. This process is buttressed by significant evidence that policy rate changes 
transmit through the term structure of interest rates, though the intensity of 
transmission varies across financial markets. Following a quarterly structural vector 
auto-regression (SVAR) model, this paper finds evidence that policy rate increases 
have a negative effect on output growth with a lag of two quarters and a moderating 
impact on inflation with a lag of three quarters. The overall impact persists through 8-
10 quarters. These results are found to be robust across alternative specifications 
with different measures of output, inflation and liquidity. Moreover, significant 
unidirectional causality was found from policy interest rate to output, inflation and 
various measures of liquidity except broad money (M ), underlining the importance of 
3
interest rate as a potent monetary policy tool.
