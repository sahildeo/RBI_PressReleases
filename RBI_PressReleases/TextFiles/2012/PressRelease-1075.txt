RBI releases Branch Locator/Summary Statistics on Commercial Bank Branches 
 The Reserve Bank of India today released a “Bank Branch Locator” – a dynamic 
database giving information on location, population group, authorized dealer category and 
license details of branches/ offices of commercial banks in India. 
  The details include: region, state, district, center, address, bank and branch names, 
bank group, uniform codes (BSR Part-1 and Part-2 codes), population group (rural/semi-
urban/urban/metropolitan), date of opening/merger/amalgamation, authorised dealers (category 
A, B or C branches) and details about license/merger/amalgamation as available. Uniform 
branch codes were devised for reporting branch-wise data through Basic Statistical Returns. 
These codes are also used by Central Board of Excise and Customs and Central Board of 
Direct Taxes for their online tax accounting system. This code comprises two parts: BSR Part-1 
(seven digit unique bank branch identifier) and BSR Part-2 (seven digit unique revenue center 
identifier for the location where branch is functioning). Users of this database can search for 
bank branches/offices on the basis of the name of the center, some key words in the address 
and combinations of state/district/bank. The information in this branch locator will be updated 
on a daily basis. The information is downloadable in excel format from this branch locator.  
The information in this branch locator is as reported by banks in terms of existing branch 
authorisation policy. The database is maintained by the Bank Branch Statistics Division, 
Department of Statistics and Information Management of the Reserve Bank. Earlier, this 
information was released by the Reserve Bank through a publication called “Directory of 
Scheduled Commercial Bank Offices in India” in CD form. The last publication of 2006 under 
this title contained data in alignment with the latest round of population census (i.e., Census 
2001). Subsequently, summarised information on bank branch network was brought out in the 
publication “Branch Banking Statistics”. The latest available data was as on March 31, 2009. 
This publication contained data only for the year 2009 and did not provide time series.  
Given the demanding needs for time series data on account of the policy thrust on 
financial inclusion, a set of summarised time series data is also being released along with the 
Bank Branch Locator. These summary statistics form a quarterly time series beginning from 
March 2006 in respect of number of functioning branches of commercial banks in India, and is 
presented according to various combinations of location (Region/State/District/Center), 
population group (rural/semi-urban/urban/metropolitan), population tier groups (Tier 1 to 6), 
bank groups (SBI and Associates, Nationalised, Other Public Sector Banks, New/ Old Private 
Sector Banks, Foreign Banks and Regional Rural Banks). 
The users can access Bank Branch Locator and the related summary statistics from the 
“Database on Indian Economy: RBI’s Data Warehouse (DBIE)” on RBI website 
(www.rbi.org.in).
