RBI releases Report of the Working Group to review the existing prudential 
guidelines on restructuring of advances by banks/financial institutions 
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) today placed on its website the Report of the 
Working Group (WG) to review the existing prudential guidelines on restructuring of 
advances by banks/financial institutions (Chairperson: Shri B. Mahapatra). 
Comments on the Report may please be emailed or forwarded by August 21, 2012 
to the Chief General Manager-in-Charge, Department of Banking Operations and 
Development, Reserve Bank of India, Central Office, Mumbai-400 001.   
The WG approached the mandate given to it from the perspective that 
restructuring of advances serves a useful social purpose as it protects the productive 
assets of the economy. It also approached the issue from the perspective that 
internationally restructuring of an account is considered as an event of impairment 
irrespective of whether an account’s asset classification status is downgraded or not. 
The WG has, however, suggested a gradual and calibrated approach. 
The key recommendations of the WG are: 
• The RBI may do away with the regulatory forbearance regarding asset 
classification, provisioning and capital adequacy on restructuring of loan and 
advances in line with the international prudential measures. However, in view 
of the current domestic macroeconomic situation as also global situation, this 
measure could be considered say, after a period of two years. (Para 6.9)   
 
• In the interregnum, in order to prudently recognise the inherent risks in 
existing assets classified as standard on restructuring (stock), the provision 
requirement on such accounts should be increased from the present 2% to 
5% in a phased manner over a two-year period, i.e. 3.5% in the first year and 
5% in the second year. However, in cases of new restructuring of standard 
asset (flow), provision of 5% should be made with immediate effect.(Para 
6.10) 
 
• Notwithstanding the recommendation for progressively doing away with the 
asset classification benefit on restructuring, the WG felt that extant asset 
classification benefits in cases of change of date of commencement of 
commercial operation (DCCO) of infrastructure project loans may be allowed 
to continue for some more time in view of the uncertainties involved in 
obtaining clearances from various authorities and importance of the sector in 
national growth and development. (Para 6.11)

• Accounts classified as NPAs upon restructuring are presently eligible for up-
gradation to the 'standard' category after observation of 'satisfactory 
performance' during the 'specified period'. The specified period has been 
defined as a period of one year from the date when the first payment of 
interest or instalment of principal falls due under the terms of restructuring 
package. The WG has recommended that the ‘specified period’ should be 
redefined in cases of restructuring with multiple credit facilities as ‘one year 
from the commencement of the first payment of interest or principal, 
whichever is later, on the credit facility with longest period of moratorium. 
(Para 6.19)  
   
• Conversion of debt into preference shares should be done only as a last 
resort. Also, conversion of debt into equity/preference shares should be 
restricted to a cap (say 10% of the restructured debt). Further, conversion of 
debt into equity should be done only in the case of listed companies. (Para 
6.52 & 6.53)  
  
• A higher amount of promoters’ sacrifice in cases of restructuring of large 
exposures under CDR mechanism needs to be considered. Further, the 
promoters’ contribution should be prescribed at a minimum of 15% of the 
diminution in fair value of the restructured account or 2% of the restructured 
debt, whichever is higher. (Para 6.50) 
   
• As stipulating personal guarantee will ensure promoters’ “skin in the game” or 
commitment to the restructuring package, obtaining the personal guarantee of 
promoters be made a mandatory requirement in all cases of restructuring, i.e., 
even if the restructuring is necessitated on account of external factors 
pertaining to the economy and industry. Further, corporate guarantee should 
not be considered as a substitute for the promoters’ personal guarantee. 
(Para 6.66 & 6.67) 
 
• RBI may prescribe the broad benchmarks for the viability parameters based 
on those used by CDR Cell; and banks may suitably adopt them with 
appropriate adjustments, if any, for specific sectors. The WG also felt that the 
prescribed time span of seven years for non-infrastructure borrowal accounts 
and ten years for infrastructure accounts for becoming viable on restructuring 
was too long and banks should take it as an outer limit. The WG, therefore, 
recommended that, in times when there is no general downturn in the 
economy, the viability time span should not be more than five years in non-
infrastructure cases and not more than eight years in infrastructure cases. 
(Para 6.24 &6.25) 
 
• In terms of present guidelines, banks are required to disclose annually all 
accounts restructured in their books on a cumulative basis even though many 
of them would have subsequently shown satisfactory performance over a 
sufficiently long period. The WG has, therefore, recommended that once the 
higher provisions and risk weights (if applicable) on restructured advances 
(classified as standard either abinitio or on upgradation from NPA category) 
revert back to the normal level on account of satisfactory performance during 
the prescribed period, such advances should no longer be required to be 
disclosed by banks as restructured accounts in the “Notes on Accounts” in 
their Annual Balance Sheets. (Para 6.28) 3 
 
• The WG observed that there were cases which were found to be viable before 
restructuring but the assumptions leading to viability did not materialise in due 
course of time. There were also cases where the approved restructuring 
package could not be implemented satisfactorily due to external reasons or 
due to promoters’ non-adherence to the terms and conditions. The WG 
recommended that in such cases, banks should be advised to assess the 
situation early and use the exit options with a view to minimise the losses. The 
WG also recommended that the terms and conditions of restructuring should 
inherently contain the principle of ‘carrot and stick’, i.e. while restructuring 
being an incentive for viable accounts, it should also have disincentives for 
non-adherence to the terms of restructuring and under-performance. (Para 
6.59) 
 
• Due to the current guidelines issued by CDR Cell that recompense be 
calculated on compounding basis and that 100% of recompense so calculated 
is payable, exit of companies from CDR system was not happening. 
Therefore, the WG recommended that CDR Standing Forum/Core Group may 
take a view as to whether their clause on ‘recompense’ may be made 
somewhat flexible in order to facilitate the exit of the borrowers from CDR 
Cell. However, it also recommended that in any case 75% of the amount of 
recompense calculated should be recovered from the borrowers and in cases 
of restructuring where a facility has been granted below base rate, 100% of 
the recompense amount should be recovered. The WG also recommended 
that the present recommendatory nature of ‘recompense’ clause should be 
made mandatory even in cases of non-CDR restructurings. (Para 6.63 & 6.64)
  
Background 
It may be recalled that in the Second Quarter Review of Monetary Policy 
2011-12 announced on October 25, 2011, it was proposed to constitute a WG to 
review the existing prudential guidelines on restructuring of advances by 
banks/financial institutions and suggest revisions taking into account the best 
international practices and accounting standards. Accordingly, a WG was constituted 
on January 31, 2012 under the Chairmanship of Shri B. Mahapatra, Executive 
Director, RBI. The WG had members representing RBI, select commercial banks, 
IBA, CDR Cell and a rating agency. The WG was required to submit its Report by 
July 31, 2012.
