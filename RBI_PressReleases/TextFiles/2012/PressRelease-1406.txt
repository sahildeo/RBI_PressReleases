Submission of Supplementary Claims by Liquidators of 
Insured Co-operative Banks under Liquidation - “Sunset” Clause 
During the years preceding April 2007, the joint accounts (AB & BA) in a bank 
under liquidation were being aggregated as one account held “in the same capacity 
and in the same right” and the claim amount was settled by the DICGC subject to the 
limit (` 1 lakh) as prescribed in Section 16(1) of the DICGC Act, 1961. DICGC had 
issued revised guidelines with effect from April 26, 2007, in terms of which such joint 
accounts of different combination i.e.  A & B and B & A were to be treated as 
accounts held in “different capacity and different right” and the claim amounts in 
respect of these joint accounts were to be settled treating each such joint account as 
a separate account.  
The  benefit of the revised guidelines  were subsequently  extended to banks 
which had been taken up for liquidation prior to April 26, 2007 (hereinafter referred to 
as ‘the said date’)  and the Corporation has been settling the additional claims 
submitted by the liquidators in the form of supplementary claims arising on account 
of these  revised guidelines from time to time.  
Almost five years have passed and it is presumed that as of now, liquidators 
would have submitted the supplementary claims in respect of all the eligible joint 
account holders in banks under liquidation prior to the said date and the eligible 
claim amounts in terms of the revised instructions have been settled by the 
Corporation.  
The guidelines have accordingly been reviewed and  it has now been decided 
that  the liquidators would be allowed to submit the Supplementary Claims in respect 
of joint accounts held on AB/BA basis in co-operative banks taken up for liquidation 
prior to the said date  only up to the end of this financial year i.e. up to March 31, 
2013.  Liquidators of all the insured cooperative banks taken up for liquidation prior 
to the said date  have been advised by the Corporation to ensure that any 
Supplementary claims still pending are submitted on or before March 31, 2013. No 
supplementary claims in respect of such accounts, submitted by them after March 
31, 2013 would thereafter be considered by the Corporation.  
The benefit of the revised guidelines dated April 26, 2007 in respect of insured 
cooperative banks which have been liquidated prior to April 26, 2007 shall stand 
withdrawn and cease to have effect from March 31, 2013.
