RBI Working Paper Series : 
Estimation of Capacity Utilisation in Indian Industries: 
 Issues and Challenges  
 
The estimation of capacity utilisation (CU) derives significance from the fact 
that, if properly assessed, it may provide a reliable indication of incipient inflationary 
pressure in an economy. Measurement of CU is not confined to a unique method 
and can be measured for an economy, industry or plant through surveys or the use 
of production data.  
International experience suggests official estimates of CU are not released by 
many countries. In almost all the cases, the official estimates of capacity utilisation of 
the manufacturing sector are based on the results of various business tendency 
surveys conducted by the central bank, government or their agents. In India, there is 
no official estimate of CU.  
In this paper an attempt has been made to identify the more suitable method 
of estimating CU in Indian industries through a comparative analysis of the time 
series and survey method and a study of the international practices. The findings of 
the study reveal that the time series estimates of CU can capture the business cycle 
fluctuations and the inflationary pressures in the economy fairly well. But the 
international experience and the methodological limitations of the time series 
measures put forward survey method as the more suitable model for estimating CU 
in the Indian industries. It is important, however, to compare the CU estimates 
obtained from the survey of select firms, with those obtained from time series 
methods to ensure that the appropriate macroeconomic picture is captured and both 
series reflect similar trends.
