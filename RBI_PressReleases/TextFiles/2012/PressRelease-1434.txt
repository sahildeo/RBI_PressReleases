Highlights:   
1. Developments in India's Balance of Payments during Third Quarter 
(October-December) of 2011-12 
The article provides details on developments in India's balance of payments 
during October-December 2011-12 (Q3). The disaggregated data on invisibles for 
the Q3 of 2011-12 along with quarterly data Q1 and Q2 of 2011-12 and annual data 
for 2009-10 and 2010-11 have also been published as part of the article. 
Main Findings: 
 During Q3 of 2011-12, India’s BoP came under stress as trade deficit 
widened, while capital inflows fell far short of financing requirements resulting 
in a significant drawdown of foreign exchange reserves.  
 Export growth decelerated in October-December 2011 owing to economic 
sluggishness, particularly in advanced economies. Imports continued to rise 
largely due to high international commodity prices and inelastic demand for 
gold and silver. As a result, trade deficit rose little over 50 per cent (Y-o-Y). 
 On a BoP basis, merchandise exports recorded a growth of 7.9 per 
cent during Q3 of 2011-12 while imports registered a growth of 22.0 per cent 
during Q3 of 2011-12. With export growth remaining lower than the import 
growth, the trade deficit widened to US$47.7 billion in Q3 of 2011-12 as 
compared with US$ 31.4 billion in Q3 of 2010-11.  
 Net services exports and net secondary income recorded a robust growth 
during Q3 of 2011-12; however, net primary income account showed a net 
outflow. Consequently, the current account deficit (CAD) widened to US$ 19.6 
billion in Q3 of 2011-12 which works out to 4.3 per cent of GDP.  2 
 
 Capital and Financial account (excluding change in foreign exchange 
reserves), on a net basis, showed a significantly lower inflow of US$ 8.2 billion 
in Q3 of 2011-12 as compared with US$ 14.0 billion in Q3 of 2010-11. 
 As a result, there was a drawdown of foreign exchange reserves of US$ 12.8 
billion (excluding valuation) during Q3 of 2011-12 as against an increase of 
US$ 4.0 billion in the corresponding quarter of 2010-11. 
 During April-December 2011, the CAD at US$ 53.7 billion (4.0 per cent of 
GDP) was higher than the corresponding period of the previous year mainly 
on account of increase in trade deficit, though services and secondary income 
recorded higher growth.  
 Net inflows under Capital and Financial account (excluding changes in 
reserve assets) at US$ 47.5 billion showed moderation in April-December 
2011 as compared with US$ 52.9 billion in April-December 2010. 
 There was a drawdown of reserves to the extent of US$ 7.1 billion during 
April-December 2011 as against an accretion of US$ 11.0 billion in April-
December 2010. 
2. Foreign Direct Investment Flows to India 
An analysis of the recent trends in foreign direct investment (FDI) flows at the 
global level as well as across regions/countries suggests that India has generally 
attracted higher FDI flows in line with its robust domestic economic performance and 
gradual liberalisation of the FDI policy as part of the cautious capital account 
liberalisation process. Even during the recent global crisis, FDI inflows to India did 
not show as much moderation as was the case at the global level as well as in other 
EMEs. However, when the global FDI flows to Emerging Market Economies (EMEs) 
recovered during 2010-11, FDI flows to India remained sluggish despite relatively 
better domestic economic performance ahead of global recovery. This raised 
questions especially in the backdrop of the widening of the current account deficit 
beyond the sustainable level of about 3 per cent. 
Main Findings: 
 Using Kauffmann’s Index, the Reserve Bank of India conducted an empirical 
exercise to analyse the factors behind such moderation.  
 The study suggested that institutional factors, such as, policy uncertainty, are 
causing the slowdown in FDI inflows to India despite robustness of 
macroeconomic variables.  
 A panel exercise for 10 major EMEs showed that FDI was significantly 
influenced by openness, growth prospects, macroeconomic sustainability, 
labour costs and uncertainty in government policy. 
 A comparison of actual FDI flows to India vis-à-vis the potential level worked 
out on the basis of underlying macroeconomic fundamentals showed that 
actual FDI which generally tracked the potential level till 2009-10, fell short of 
its potential during 2010-11.  
 Further, counter-factual scenario attempted to segregate economic and non-
economic factors seemed to suggest that the divergence between actual and 
potential during 2010-11 could partly be on account of policy uncertainty.  
3. International Trade in Banking Services, 2009-10 and 2010-11 
The article presents the findings of the 2009-10 and 2010-11 rounds of the 
Reserve Bank’s survey on International Trade in Banking Services (ITBS) covering 
overseas branches/subsidiaries/associates of Indian banks and branches of foreign 3 
 
banks operating in India. The survey covered 309 out of 319 branches of foreign 
banks operating in India and 153 of the 155 branches/offices of Indian banks 
operating abroad in 30 countries as at end-March 2011. In addition, Indian banks 
operating abroad also furnished data for their 150 overseas subsidiaries and 81 
overseas associates. Consistent and comparable data are captured on financial 
auxiliaries’ services rendered by the banks based on explicit/implicit fee/commission 
charged to customers.  
Main findings:  
 The global financial crisis had some adverse impact on international trade in 
banking services during the reference period. These were reflected in 
changes in size of their balance sheets, activity-wise and country-wise 
composition of fee income and profitability ratios. 
 Indian banks’ branches operating abroad generated a major share of fee 
income by rendering services related to credit and trade finance, whereas 
foreign banks in India generated a major share of fee income by rendering 
derivative, stock, securities, foreign exchange trading services and financial 
consultancy and advisory services.  
 Foreign banks’ operations in India were subdued in the wake of the crisis and 
their balance sheets which contracted during 2009-10 expanded later in 2010-
11. On the other hand, overseas branches of Indian banks continued to 
expand their overseas business during the period. 
 Fee income of overseas branches of Indian banks from rendering services to 
residents, non-residents in India and non-residents from other countries was 
evenly distributed whereas a dominant portion of fee income of foreign banks 
came from residents.  
 The size of operations of foreign banks in India was much larger than the 
overseas operations of India banks during the reference period. As such, 
income from trade in banking services was much higher for foreign banks in 
India than that generated by overseas branches/subsidiaries of Indian banks. 
4. Consumer Confidence Survey: January-March 2012 (Round 8) 
 
This article presents the salient findings of the Consumer Confidence Survey 
conducted in March 2012, the 8th round in the series. The survey covers 5,352 
households well-spread in six metro cities. Based on perceptions of the general 
economic and own financial situation, the survey captures the households’ 
confidence in the current and expected economic conditions, household 
circumstances, employment conditions, current and future spending and prices. The 
survey results are those of the respondents and are not necessarily the perceptions 
of Reserve Bank of India. 
 
Main Findings: 
 Households’ perceptions on current economic conditions and expectations 
one year ahead have moderated. However, more than half of the respondents 
perceive economic conditions to be favourable. 
 Majority of respondents perceived improvement in household circumstances 
than a year ago. However, proportion of respondents reporting worsening of 
household circumstances has increased marginally.  
 More than half of the respondent perceived increase in income, but this 
proportion has been sliding over the last four rounds. 4 
 
 Consistent fall in spending intentions of households in the next year.  
 Greater proportions of respondents are worried about employment prospects 
as compared with the previous round. 
 The proportion of respondents perceiving and expecting increase in price 
level declined in current round.  
 Current Situation Index and Future Expectations Index of Consumer 
Confidence declined. 
5. Inflation Expectations Survey of Households: January-March 2012 (Round 
27) 
th
 The findings of 27 round of Inflation Expectations Survey of Households for 
January-March 2012 quarter, conducted during the first fortnight of March 2012 are 
presented in the article. The survey captures the inflation expectations of 4,000 
urban households across 12 cities for the next three-month period and for the next 
one-year period. These expectations are based on their individual consumption 
baskets and, hence, should not be considered as predictors of any official measure 
of inflation. The households’ inflation expectations provide useful directional 
information on near-term inflationary pressures and also supplement other economic 
indicators to get a better indication of future inflation. The survey results are those of 
the respondents and not necessarily shared by the Reserve Bank of India. 
Main Findings: 
 The three-month ahead and one-year ahead inflation expectations have 
marginally declined to 11.7 per cent and 12.5 per cent, respectively, from 12.4 
per cent and 13.3 per cent in the last round. Households expect inflation to 
rise further by 70 and 150 basis points during next three-month and next one-
year period, respectively, from the perceived current rate of 11.0 per cent. 
 The percentage of respondents expecting increase in general prices by ‘more 
than the current rate’ for three-month ahead and one-year ahead have gone 
up to 75.6 per cent and 78.8 per cent, respectively, from 73.4 per cent and 
76.9 per cent observed in the previous round (October-December 2011).  
 53 per cent of the wage/income earners reported an increase in 
wages/income in the past one year. While 70 per cent do not see their 
incomes to change in next three-month, 73 per cent expect incomes to go up 
in next one-year. 
 Regarding feedback on RBI action to control inflation, the survey finds 60 per 
cent of the respondents are aware of RBI action for inflation control.  
6. Order Books, Inventories and Capacity Utilisation Survey: October-
December 2011 (Round 16) 
th
The  article, the third in the series, presents the findings of the 16 round of 
the Order Books, Inventories and Capacity Utilisation Survey. The survey was 
conducted for the October-December 2011 quarter (Q3:2011-12). It captures the 
quarter-over-quarter movements in order books, inventories and capacity utilisation 
based on a sample of manufacturing companies, which are important indicators of 
economic activities, inflationary pressures and overall business cycle and, as such, 
are useful for assessing the consumption and investment demand outlook. 
Main Findings: 
 The survey results indicate some improvement in demand conditions in 
Q3:2011-12 based on various parameters, viz., new orders growth, level of 5 
 
capacity utilisation and finished goods inventory to sales ratio over the 
previous quarter.  
 Capacity utilisation level at the aggregate level increased from 73.9 per cent 
in previous quarter to 75.9 per cent in Q3:2011-12, but it was well below the 
peak level achieved in Q4:2010-11. 
7. Quarterly Industrial Outlook Survey: January-March 2012 (Round 57) 
The  article presents the findings of Industrial Outlook Survey conducted for 
th
the January-March 2012 quarter, the 57 round in the series. It gives an assessment 
of business situation of companies in manufacturing sector, for the quarter January-
March 2012, and their expectations for the ensuing quarter April-June 2012. 
Main Findings: 
 The survey indicates that the demand conditions based on ‘production’, ‘order 
books’, ‘capacity utilisation’ (CU), ‘imports’ and ‘exports’ showed sign of 
improvement in assessment quarter when compared with the previous 
quarter; however, slight moderation is indicated in expectation quarter. The 
level of optimism on ‘availability of finance’ improved marginally in both the 
assessment and expectation quarters after steady decline in the last 4 
quarters. Cost pressure from ‘raw material’ and ‘external finance’ continued 
but with slight moderation. 
 The Business Expectation Index, a measure that gives a single snapshot of 
the industrial outlook in each study quarter, increased to 114.9 from 110.1 for 
assessment quarter but declined to 116.8 from 117.2 for expectation quarter; 
however, it remains well above 100, the threshold that separates contraction 
from expansion. 
8. Union Budget 2012-13: An Assessment           
The article is an assessment of the Union Budget 2012-13 presented to the 
Parliament on March 16, 2012. It starts with an analysis of the underlying 
macroeconomic framework of the Budget and draws attention to the Central 
Government’s strategy to return to rule-based fiscal consolidation from 2012-13 after 
a significant fiscal slippage in 2011-12 due to shortfall in direct tax revenues and 
overshooting of subsidy expenditures. It covers the proposal to amend the FRBM 
Act, 2003 and identifies some key policy initiatives announced in the Budget in 
respect of tax reforms, agriculture, infrastructure and the financial sector. 
Main Findings: 
 The Union Budget 2012-13 indicates a favourable macroeconomic outlook in 
terms of real GDP growth (7.6 per cent), inflation scenario (6.4 per cent) and 
expected moderation in current account deficit.  
 The fiscal outcome in terms of revised estimates (RE) for 2011-12 turned out 
to be worse than budgeted. The Central Government’s gross fiscal deficit 
(GFD) and revenue deficit (RD), as ratios to GDP, were higher at 5.9 per cent 
and 4.4 per cent, respectively, in   2011-12 (RE) over the budgeted estimates 
of 4.6 per cent and 3.4 per cent for the same year, reflecting the impact of 
higher non-plan revenue expenditure, lower revenue receipts and the 
downward revision in GDP. 
 The budgetary estimates for 2012-13 indicate the commitment to carry 
forward fiscal consolidation. The RD, as a ratio to GDP, is budgeted to decline 
by 1 percentage point to 3.4 per cent of GDP in 2012-13. Similarly, the GFD-
GDP ratio is budgeted to decline to 5.1 per cent in 2012-13 from the level of 
5.9 per cent in the previous year. 6 
 
 In 2012-13, the tax-GDP ratio is budgeted to increase by 0.5 percentage 
point, through roll-back of standard excise tax rates to 12 per cent, widening 
of the service tax base and rationalisation of customs duty rates. 
 Revenue expenditure growth is budgeted to decelerate in 2012-13, while 
capital expenditure (both plan and non-plan components) is expected to 
increase sharply.  The restraint on non-plan revenue expenditure growth is 
critical to ensure that the fiscal consolidation going forward is sustainable, and 
not excessively reliant on revenue augmentation. 
 The expenditure on subsidies is budgeted to decline in 2012-13, which may 
be subject to upward risks, particularly in view of rising international petroleum 
prices.  
 Moving forward, the Government envisages corrections in RD and GFD under 
its rolling targets for 2013-14 and 2014-15. The targeted key deficit-GDP 
ratios to be achieved by 2014-15 would, however, remain higher than those 
recommended by the Thirteenth Finance Commission.  
 The introduction of amendments to the FRBM Act, 2003 as part of Finance 
Bill, 2012 and incorporation of ‘Medium-term Expenditure Framework 
Statement’ in the Act are significant initiatives towards fiscal consolidation in 
2012-13. The latter would set out three-year rolling targets for expenditure 
indicators, which could improve quality of public expenditure management.  
9. Railway Budget 2012-13: An Assessment 
The article covers the salient features of the Railway Budget 2011-12, which 
was presented in the Parliament on March 14, 2012. 
Main Findings: 
 The Railway Budget 2012-13 focuses on its developmental role as a catalyst 
of growth, defines its investment priorities and attempts to address the basic 
problem relating to its weak financial position through tariff and fare revision 
measures. 
 There is special emphasis on safety-enhancing and modernisation measures; 
the latter measures have been recommended by two High Level Committees 
and relate to areas of rolling stock, tracks and bridges, signaling and 
telecommunication. 
 The gross traffic receipts of Railways are budgeted to increase by 25.3 per 
cent during 2012-13, reflecting higher earnings from both passenger travel 
and freight traffic. Nonetheless, rollback of the fares after the announcement 
of the Railway Budget in some classes may make it difficult to realise the 
budgeted passenger earnings and to achieve a budgeted reduction in 
operating ratio of more than 10 percentage points to 84.9 per cent during 
2012-13. 
 Taking note of resource constraints, a number of projects are proposed to be 
undertaken under PPP mode and with the partnership of the States. The 
financial performance indicators such as operating ratio, net surplus and 
return on capital are expected to improve during 2012-13.
