State Finances: A Study of Budgets of 2011-12 
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) today released “State Finances: A Study of Budgets of 2011-
12”, a publication that provides data, analysis and assessment of finances of State governments. 
The State government budgets for 2011-12 proposed to carry forward the fiscal correction 
process by focusing more on expenditure control against the backdrop of roll back of fiscal 
stimulus measures and tapering off of the impact of the Sixth Pay Commission award. All States, 
barring one, amended their Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Acts/Rules, 
in line with the Thirteenth Finance Commission (ThFC) recommendation, with the aim of 
eliminating revenue deficits and bringing about graduated reductions in fiscal deficit and debt 
levels latest by 2014-15.  
Role of the Reserve Bank in State Finances  
The theme chapter on the “Role of the Reserve Bank in State Finances” traces the 
responsibilities of the Reserve Bank which have, over the years, increased beyond its mandated 
roles of serving as a banker and debt manager of the State governments. As a banker to the 
States, the Reserve Bank extends banking services to all the States. It also modulates ways and 
means (WMA) limits and overdraft (OD) regulations to meet the short-term resource 
requirements of the States without impinging upon fiscal discipline and monetary stability. As a 
debt manager, the Reserve Bank created the enabling conditions for the States to transit from an 
administered system to a full-fledged auction system for market borrowings. Apart from these 
traditional roles, the Reserve Bank has also been playing an advisory role and has been 
instrumental in initiating rule-based medium-term fiscal consolidation of the States, besides 
advising them on policy issues emerging from time to time to ensure fiscal sustainability. The 
dissemination of information and analysis of State finances by the Reserve Bank every year have 
become an important reference for not only undertaking policy decisions but also facilitating 
research in this area. 
 
Issues in State finances
The Study also highlights several issues of significance and concern for the State Governments. 
Although all the States except Goa have amended their FRBM Acts/Rules, most of them do not 
include provisions for additional disclosures for enabling transparent assessment of State 
finances. The recommended restructuring of the public expenditure system would enable better 
?nullnull???nullnullnull??management of outlays for effective outcomes. Successful restructuring of the public expenditure 
management system would, however, call for appropriate assimilation of the new system across 
the government machineries at all levels including the Planning Commission, the Central and the 
State governments. The rationalisation of the operation of Centrally Sponsored Schemes is 
expected to address the issues of lack of flexibility in these schemes, counterpart funding 
shortage from States and low utility of large number of schemes with thinly spread resources at 
the field level. The financial losses of State power utilities continue to be a drag on State finances 
which necessitate not only renegotiating debt liabilities of distribution utilities but also 
undertaking necessary reforms to enable independent functioning of State Electricity Regulatory 
Commissions and to address issues relating to periodic tariff revisions. As part of fiscal 
transparency initiatives, the State governments need to ensure that their finances capture both 
explicit and implicit liabilities associated with certain off-budget activities, including project 
financing undertaken through SPVs/public-private partnership mode. There is also need for 
greater focus on structural issues confronting State finances, particularly for those States that 
could not undertake rule-based fiscal corrections prior to the crisis years of 2008-09 and 2009-
10. 
Major findings of the Study
Fiscal consolidation budgeted to continue in  2011-12, with a turnaround in the consolidated 
revenue account
• The consolidated revenue account is budgeted to switch from deficit to surplus during 
2011-12 after a gap of two years, driven primarily by a compression in revenue 
expenditure.  
• The improvement in the revenue account is expected to not only provide the necessary 
resources for increased capital outlay but also enable a reduction in the GFD-GDP ratio 
by 0.5 percentage point in 2011-12(BE) over 2010-11(RE). The envisaged fiscal deficit-
GDP ratio for 2011-12 is, however, higher than the ThFC’s annual path, mainly on 
account of higher capital outlay. 
Improvement in key fiscal indicators to be broad-based across States 
• Most States have budgeted to eliminate their revenue deficit in 2011-12 as envisioned by 
the ThFC, with 23 out of the 28 States expected to record revenue surpluses. The GFD-
GSDP ratio is budgeted to decline in 18 States during 2011-12, even though capital 
outlay (CO)-GSDP ratio is placed higher in 17 States during the same period.  
• The budgeted improvement in the revenue account is led by a reduction in  revenue 
expenditure-GSDP ratio in 16 States.  
Decline in key expenditure ratios raises concern regarding the quality of fiscal adjustment
• State-wise position with regard to quality of expenditure shows that during 2011-12, out 
of the 28 States, 15 States have budgeted for a decline in development expenditure-GSDP 
ratio and 16 States have budgeted for a decline in social-sector expenditure-GSDP ratio 
over the previous year. Committed expenditure-GSDP ratio is budgeted to increase in 15 
States during the same period. This raises concerns about the quality of fiscal adjustment 
being undertaken at the State level. 
  
 
 
Decline in States’ overall debt-GDP ratio to continue in 2011-12 
• The consolidated debt-GDP ratio of the States declined during 2010-11 to 23.5 per cent 
from 25.5 per cent in 2009-10, with a reduction in debt-GSDP ratio across all the States 
(except two in the special category). With further budgeted reduction during 2011-12, 
debt-GDP ratio at 22.5 per cent is expected to be much below the ThFC recommended 
limit of 26.1 per cent for the year. This trend is poised to continue in the medium term 
with the amended FRBMs of the States setting out a graduated path of reduction in debt-
GSDP ratios for the respective States.  
• The compositional shift of outstanding liabilities towards market loans continued during 
2010-11 and is budgeted to increase further during 2011-12. The declining trend in the 
share of NSSF (the high cost component of debt) could be further reinforced in the light 
of reduction in the mandatory allocation of small savings collections for the States from 
80 per cent to 50 per cent from the fiscal year 2012-13.  
• Aided by the reduction in debt-GSDP ratios, interest payments (IP) to revenue receipts 
(RR) ratios of 14 of non-special category States are expected to be lower in 2011-12(BE) 
than their levels in 2010-11(RE).
