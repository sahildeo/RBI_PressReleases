RBI holds Annual Statistics Conference 2012  
 
The Annual Statistics Conference 2012 of the Reserve Bank of India was 
organised by its Department of Statistics and Information Management on March 17-
18, 2012 in Chandigarh. This conference provided a platform to the statisticians of 
the Reserve Bank to present their research before the external experts and receive 
their feedback in order to make analysis more meaningful for policy and research.   
Dr. K. C. Chakrabarty and Dr. Subir Gokarn, Deputy Governors; Shri Deepak 
Mohanty, Executive Director; Heads of select departments/office of the Reserve 
Bank; renowned statisticians and economists from the academia; and RBI 
statisticians participated in the conference. 
The conference highlighted some broad principles of statistical activity in the 
Reserve Bank. The two key takeaways were:  
• The Reserve Bank plays an important role in providing a large pool of 
statistics as public good. This, however, puts on it the concomitant 
responsibility to provide timely, reliable and meaningful data and its 
dissemination, by harnessing technology to its fullest possible extent.  
• The statistical research also needs to encompass operational areas, 
such as, bank supervision and further develop database for risk 
assessment, rural credit and financial inclusion.         
The conference deliberated on issues in coverage of banking data, need for 
its improvement and develop micro-level, granular and consistent data to enhance its 
utility in policy making. It underscored the need to strengthen the database on areas 
like regional and sectoral distribution of non-performing assets through more 
effective utilisation of the existing data systems of banks.  
 
?????????? 
Building on the initiatives of the Department in bridging data gaps, 
undertaking forward looking surveys, providing research inputs, and data 
dissemination for public use, some areas of further work were identified.  
These included building statistical intelligence for regional agricultural 
conditions and price developments; initiating quarterly survey on retail sales; 
strengthening modelling and forecasting capabilities; and broadbasing statistical 
research across departments and regional offices to address operational issues.
The technical sessions of the conference deliberated upon analytical issues in 
modelling, external sector developments, banking and corporate sector, surveys, risk 
measurement and other relevant areas.  
A new user-friendly interface for the Database on the Indian Economy (DBIE) 
of the Reserve Bank was released during the conference, which is now open to the 
public on the RBI website (URL http://dbie.rbi.org.in).
