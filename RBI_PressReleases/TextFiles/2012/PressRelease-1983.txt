RBI’s Second International Research Conference - 2012 
Central Banks deliberate on New Trilemma of  
Monetary Policy, Sovereign Debt and Financial Stability 
Central bankers across the globe got together in Mumbai and deliberated on 
the new trilemma of Monetary Policy, Sovereign Debt and Financial Stability. Most of 
them were of the view that the new trilemma is a reality and fiscal discipline is 
critically important for financial stability and price stability.  
The Reserve Bank of India organised the Second International Research 
Conference (SIRC) on February 1-2, 2012 in Mumbai.  The theme of the conference 
was “Monetary Policy, Sovereign Debt and Financial Stability: The New Trilemma” 
and encapsulated the complex challenges for central banks in the post crisis period. 
The first international research conference was held in February 2010, also in 
Mumbai.  
Central banks face the challenge of simultaneously ensuring price stability, 
financial stability and sovereign debt sustainability, which constitute three nodes of 
the new trilemma. The conference deliberated on the subject in three technical 
sessions, namely, (1) Conducting monetary policy post-crisis: Challenges to 
transmission mechanism and operating framework; (2) Impact of crisis on sovereign 
debt: Implications for macro-economy and inter-linkages with other policies; and (3) 
Financial stability: Evolving issues and challenges in the context of post-crisis 
macroeconomic and financial developments.  
This was followed by two panel discussions comprising Governors of central 
banks. The discussions revolved around: (1) Monetary policy, sovereign debt, and 
financial stability – the new trilemma; and (2) Role of central banks of emerging 
market economies in the context of new trilemma. The summing up of the 
conference by Shri Deepak Mohanty, Executive Director provided the essence of the 
proceedings of the conference. The conference concluded with the vote of thanks by 
Shri B. M. Misra, Officer-in-Charge, Department of Economic and Policy Research. 
Apart from Dr. D Subbarao, Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, several 
eminent central bankers, academicians, policy makers, financial regulators and 
supervisors participated in the conference to share their experience and thoughts. 
Some of the eminent participant included Governors/Head of central banks/monetary 
authorities of Brazil (Mr. Alexandre Tombini), Bangladesh (Mr. Atiur Rahman), 
Iceland (Mr. Mar Gudmundsson), Maldives (Mr. Fazeel Najeeb), Nepal (Mr. Yuba 
Raj Khatiwada), Pakistan (Mr. Yaseen Anwar), and Singapore (Mr. Ravi Menon). 
Other participants included Mr. Naoyuki Shinohara, Deputy Managing Director of 
IMF, Prof. Benjamin Friedman, Harvard University, Prof. Eswar Prasad, Cornell

Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, Dr. Stephen Cecchetti 
from Bank for International Settlements, apart from heads of major commercial 
banks, financial and research institutions from India.  
Other major takeaways from the conference were: 
1. The new trilemma is a reality, and fiscal discipline is critically important for 
financial stability and price stability.  
2. Interaction between sovereign debt and monetary policy is an important 
determinant of market confidence. A comprehensive fiscal exit strategy should 
explicitly recognise the objective of a sustainable public debt ratio and policies 
that should underpin a fiscal adjustment path.  
3. Right balance between growth in the financial sector and real sector is 
important to prevent imbalances. Warning signals always flash before the 
crisis. Often imbalances are ignored, even if identified earlier. Leaning against 
imbalances could be less costly than cleaning up later.  
4. Macro prudential measures are useful, but their effectiveness in preventing 
crisis is yet to be tested. These tools need to be fine-tuned. 
5. The fundamental responsibility of central banks for price stability should not 
be compromised and that central banks should have a lead, if not an 
exclusive responsibility, for financial stability. 
6. In the matter of ensuring financial stability, the government must normally 
leave the responsibility to the regulators and assume  an activist role only in 
times of crisis. It is possible that the short-term policies aimed at price 
stability, financial stability and sovereign debt sustainability could, at times, 
run counter to policies required for promoting growth. But, growth achieved at 
the cost of these three objectives cannot be sustained. 
7. Policy rate increases in India have a negative effect on output growth with a 
lag of two quarters and a moderating impact on inflation with a lag of three 
quarters and the overall impact on inflation persists through 8-10 quarters.   
8. Monetary policy framework should not be locked into a single target. More 
flexibility in defining objectives and instruments is necessary. Boundary 
conditions for policy environment keep changing, but transmission within the 
boundary conditions is what a central bank could aim at. 
9. Debt beyond a threshold level can adversely affect growth. Hence, debt 
reductions should be aimed at by improving  primary balance and  raising 
productivity growth.   
10. More than quantum of debt, the purpose of debt, and the quality of assets 
created against the debt are important. It was also  noted that when private 
credit to GDP ratio exceeds a threshold of 100 per cent, financial sector could 
be a drag on growth by reducing productivity growth.   
11. The global economy changed with a series of shocks over the past 5 to 6 
years questioning the self-sustaining nature of financial markets. This 
underscores the increased role of public policy in the financial sector and 
greater global co-ordination.
