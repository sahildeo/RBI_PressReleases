Mid-Quarter Monetary Policy Review: June 2012 
Monetary and Liquidity Measures 
On the basis of an assessment of the current macroeconomic situation, it has 
been decided to: 
• keep the cash reserve ratio (CRR) of scheduled banks unchanged at 4.75  
per cent of their net demand and time liabilities; and  
• keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) 
unchanged at 8.0 per cent. 
Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF will remain unchanged at 7.0 per 
cent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at  9.0 per 
cent.  
Introduction  
2. Since the Reserve Bank’s Annual Policy statement in April, global 
macroeconomic and financial conditions have deteriorated. At the same time, the 
domestic macroeconomic situation too raises several deepening concerns. While 
growth in 2011-12 has moderated significantly, headline inflation remains above 
levels consistent with sustainable growth. Importantly, retail inflation is also on an 
uptrend.  
3. The Reserve Bank had frontloaded the policy rate reduction in April with a cut 
of 50 basis points. This decision was based on the premise that the process of fiscal 
consolidation critical for inflation management would get under way, along with other 
supply-side initiatives. Our assessment of the current growth-inflation dynamic is that 
there are several factors responsible for the slowdown in activity, particularly in 
investment, with the role of interest rates being relatively small. Consequently, 
further reduction in the policy interest rate at this juncture, rather than supporting 
growth, could exacerbate inflationary pressures. 
Global Economy  
4. The euro area sovereign debt problem has continued to weigh on the global 
recovery. After a brief phase of relative calm reflecting the large liquidity injection by 
the European Central Bank (ECB), renewed concerns have arisen about a 
sustainable solution to the sovereign debt problem and the increasing vulnerability of 
the banking sector. Consequently, risk aversion has increased. Recent data suggest 
that US economic recovery is weakening. Growth in major emerging and developing 
economies (EDEs) is also moderating. While slowing global growth has dampened 
commodity prices, heightened risk aversion and the resultant slowing of capital flows 
will have a significant adverse impact on EDEs, including India. Also, should there 
be an event shock, central banks in advanced economies will likely do another round 
?null???????null????? 2
of quantitative easing. This will have an adverse impact on growth and inflation in  
EDEs, particularly on oil importing countries such as India, through a possible 
rebound in commodity prices.  
Domestic Economy  
Growth 
5. Economic activity in  2011-12 moderated sequentially over the quarters to take 
growth to a low of 5.3 per cent in Q4, though for the year as a whole it was 6.5 per 
cent. Deceleration in industrial production from the supply side and weak investment 
from the demand side have, in particular, contributed to the growth slowdown. The 
index of industrial production (IIP) increased by just 0.1 per cent in April 2012. Even 
as the manufacturing Purchasing Managers ’ Index (PMI) for May suggested that 
industrial activity remains in an expansionary mode, there is no question that the 
pace of expansion has slowed significantly.    
6. In this context, it is relevant to assess as to what extent high interest rates are 
affecting economic growth. Estimates suggest that real effective bank lending 
interest rates, though positive, remain comparatively lower than the levels seen  
during the high growth phase of 2003-08. This suggests that factors other than 
interest rates are contributing more significantly to the growth slowdown. 
7. Further, one implication of the rupee depreciation over the past several 
months is that domestic producers have gained in competitiveness over foreign 
producers. Over time, this should result in expanding exports and contracting 
imports, thus acting as a demand stimulus.   
Inflation 
8. During 2011-12, headline WPI inflation rate moderated from a peak of 10.0 
per cent in September 2011 to 7.7 per cent in March 2012. However, during 2012-13 
so far, provisional data suggest that it inched up from 7.2 per cent in April to 7.6 per 
cent in May, driven mainly by food and fuel prices. Primary food articles inflation 
rose from negative [(-) 0.7 per cent)] in January to 10.7 per cent in May largely due 
to a sharp increase in vegetable prices. Protein inflation continued to be in double 
digits. With food prices contributing so heavily to headline inflation, the performance 
of the south-west monsoon will also play a role in determining inflationary conditions 
over the course of the current year.  
9. Though international crude prices have fallen significantly from their levels in 
April 2012, the rupee depreciation has significantly offset its impact on wholesale 
prices. Further, even at the current lower level of global crude oil prices, significant 
under-recoveries persist in respect of administered petroleum product prices. The 
positive development on the inflation front is that core (non-food manufactured 
products) inflation has trended down. 
10. Consumer price index (CPI) inflation (as measured by the new series, base 
year 2010) rose from 8.8 per cent in February to 9.4 per cent in March and further to 
10.4 per cent in April. Significantly, CPI inflation, excluding food and fuel, was also in 
double digits suggesting that moderation in wholesale price inflation has not 
transmitted to the retail level.   
11. Notwithstanding the moderation in core inflation, the persistence of overall 
inflation both at the wholesale and retail levels, in the face of significant growth 
slowdown, points to serious supply bottlenecks and sticky inflation expectations. 
Also, in the absence of pass-through from international crude oil prices to domestic 
prices, the consumption of petroleum products remains strong distorting price  3
signals and preventing the much needed adjustment in aggregate demand. The 
consequent subsidy burden on the Government is crowding out public investment at 
a time when reviving investment, both public and private, is a critical imperative. The 
widening current account deficit (CAD), despite the slowdown in growth, is 
symptomatic of demand-supply imbalances and a pointer to the urgent need to 
resolve the supply bottlenecks. 
Liquidity Conditions  
12. Although money supply (M ) growth has been slightly under the projected 
3
trajectory, credit growth has moved above the projected rate.  Notably, the widening 
wedge between deposit growth and credit growth is intensifying liquidity pressures. 
However, the open market operations (OMOs) have substantially eased liquidity 
conditions, as is reflected in the stabilization of the overnight call money rate close to 
the policy repo rate.  To further augment liquidity and encourage banks to increase 
credit flow  to the export sector, the Reserve Bank has increased the limit of export 
credit refinance from 15 per cent of outstanding export credit of banks to 50 per cent, 
which will potentially release additionally liquidity of over  `300 billion, equivalent  to 
about 50 basis points  reduction in the CRR. 
External sector  
13. During 2011-12, the widening CAD, in the face of worsening global economic 
and financial conditions, exerted downward pressure on the rupee. As capital inflows 
continue to remain muted, the rupee has further depreciated since April. Prospects 
for increasing capital inflows depend on both global conditions, particularly a credible 
resolution of the euro area situation, and an improvement in the domestic investment 
climate.  
Guidance 
14. The evolving growth-inflation dynamic will continue to influence the Reserve 
Bank's stance on interest rates. Core inflation has moderated, reflecting demand 
conditions and lower pricing power. However, both headline and retail inflation rates 
are rising, which have a bearing on inflation expectations. Future actions will depend 
on a continuing assessment of external and domestic developments that contribute 
to lowering inflation risks. 
15. Management of liquidity remains a priority. Even as the liquidity situation 
converges to the comfort zone, the Reserve Bank will continue to use OMOs as and 
when warranted to contain liquidity pressures. 
16. Finally, recognizing that the global situation is turbulent, the Reserve Bank 
stands ready to use all available instruments and measures to respond rapidly and 
appropriately to any adverse developments.
