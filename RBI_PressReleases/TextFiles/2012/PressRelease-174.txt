The Reserve Bank of India has set up a supervisory college for State Bank of 
India (SBI) and ICICI Bank Ltd. The objective of establishing supervisory college is to 
deal with supervisory issues revolving around these banks and establish a 
cooperation mechanism for cross-border supervision.  
 
Supervisory colleges have evolved the world over as an important component 
of effective supervisory oversight of an international banking group.  This mechanism 
was developed with the aim of reducing supervisory overlap and filling in supervisory 
gaps for better supervisory co-operation enunciated in Basel II Framework. The 
concept was enunciated in the Basel Committee for Banking Supervision (BCBS) 
October 2010 Document, "Good Practice Principles on Supervisory Colleges".   
 
Though India does not have any Systemically Important Banks (SIBs), with a 
view to benchmarking India with the best practices across the globe and in its 
capacity as the home country supervisor, the Reserve Bank decided to establish a 
supervisory college each for SBI and ICICI Bank Ltd., as both banks have vast 
expanse of overseas operations spreading across many supervisory jurisdictions. 
 
For State Bank of India (SBI) there are nine host country supervisors. These 
are, Bangladesh Bank, Central Bank of Bahrain, National Bank of Belgium, Dubai 
Financial Services Authority, Financial Services Authority (London), Federal 
Financial Services Authority (BaFin), Bank of Mauritius, Nepal Rastra Bank and 
Monetary Authority of Singapore. ICICI Bank Ltd. has seven host country 
supervisors. These are Central Bank of Bahrain, National Bank of Belgium, Dubai 
Financial Services Authority, Financial Services Authority (London), Federal 
Financial Services Authority (BaFin), Bank of Russia and Monetary Authority of 
Singapore.  
 
At a meeting of all the host country supervisors., Dr. K.C. Chakrabarty, 
Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India hoped that the college, being a process 
and not a one-time forum, will become a key tool of consolidated supervision 
particularly considering the ever expanding footprint of Indian banks abroad. He was 
inaugurating the first meeting of supervisory colleges for SBI and ICICI Ltd., held in 
Mumbai on December 03/04, 2012. Shri G. Gopalakrishna, Executive Director, 
Reserve Bank of India gave an overview of the supervisory architecture being 
practiced in the Reserve Bank and also touched upon the recent changes made to 
the supervisory methodologies within it.

management, including Gap analysis, Business Plan ahead, Regulatory Compliance, 
Liquidity/Crisis Management, relationship with overseas branches/subsidiaries, 
Enterprise (Group wide) activities and Risk perceptions etc. These presentations 
were followed by an interactive session between the banks and the College of 
Supervisors.  Shri Pratip Chaudhuri, Chairman, SBI and Smt. Chanda Kochhar, MD 
& CEO, ICICI Bank Ltd., led their teams during the presentations to the Supervisory 
College. The meet ended with a wrap up session on each day summing up the key 
take aways and resolving to follow up with further initiatives on supervisory 
cooperation to build upon the gains made in the meets.
