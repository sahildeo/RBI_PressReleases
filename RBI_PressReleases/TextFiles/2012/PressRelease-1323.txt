Expenditure Restructuring is Imperative for Fiscal Consolidation Going Forward:
RBI Governor addresses Finance Secretaries
Fiscal consolidation at state level needs special attention with focus on
expenditure restructuring. There is greater need to improve the tax-GDP ratio so that
debt remains sustainable, Dr. D. Subbarao, Governor, Reserve Bank of India,
emphasised today while inaugurating State Finance Secretaries conference at Mumbai.
th
The 25 Conference of the State Finance Secretaries was held in the Reserve
Bank of India at Mumbai today. Finance Secretaries of 26 States participated. Dr.
D.Subbarao, Governor, Reserve Bank of India inaugurated the Conference. Shri S.M.
Kumar, Additional Controller General of Accounts; Shri C.Gopinathan, Director General,
CAG; and Dr. Subir Gokarn, Shri Anand Sinha, and Shri. H.R. Khan, Deputy Governors
and other senior officials of the Ministry of Finance, CAG, Planning Commission and
the RBI attended the Conference.
Governor highlighted that the large borrowing requirements by the Government
have the potential to crowd out credit to the private sector and such phenomenon will
become more critical if there is fiscal slippage. The market borrowings by State
Governments has also gone up attaining a critical mass alongside huge and rising
market borrowing by the Centre and therefore, there was need for coordinated debt
management to avoid pressure on liquidity, and crowding out, he added. On raising
Govt borrowings, Governor underlined that RBI efforts need to be complemented by
States by spreading of borrowing throughout the year and submitting tentative calendar
in advance. Governor also underlined the importance of power sector reforms so as to
insulate States’ finances.
The Governments, both at Centre and States have important role in generating
and promoting the supply response so that inflation could be managed within the
comfortable zone and at the same time, potential output grows. Governor urged the
State Finance Secretaries to continue introducing supply enhancing measures,
including management of Public Distribution System, and steps to improve storage and
transportation infrastructure, promotion of research and development in agriculture,
effective utilisation and improvement in irrigation facilities.
Other issues discussed in today’s deliberations were management of cash
balances and market borrowings of the State Governments for 2012-13, strengthening
of Consolidated Sinking Fund, key risk to State Finances from increasing losses of
power distribution utilities, financial inclusion through business correspondents,
payment of commission by State Governments for encouraging electronic benefits
transfers (EBT) through banks, incidents of frauds committed by Multi-Level Marketing
(MLM) companies, Protection of Interest of Depositors Act, electronic mode of payment
and receipt for Government’s banking business, and complaints relating to Govt
pension.
