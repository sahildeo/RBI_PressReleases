RBI sets up a “Monitoring Group of Bankers” for close
simplified foreign currency export credit schemes
On February 28, 1999 the Reserve Bank of India had announced a scheme for
revamping and major simplification of procedures for sanctioning of export credit in
foreign currency to exporters, in particular small and medium exporters, at
Under the revamped scheme, in addition to the rate of interest being directly
linked to London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR), it has also been provided that
export credit will be need-based and not directly related to collateral security. Among
other important features of the revamped scheme are : making available a ‘line of
credit’ for a period of upto three years on the basis of exporter’s track record,
flexibility in regard to the method of assessment of credit requirements, disbursement
of credit on the basis of a statement of orders in hand, on approval by consortium,
member banks to simultaneously initiate sanctioning process, submission of original
sale contract/order not to be insisted upon for handling export documents unless
With a view to closely monitoring implementation by banks of the simplified
procedures, and to sort out any operational problem that might arise in making foreign
currency credit facilities available to exporters liberally, more particularly small and
medium scale exporters, The Reserve Bank has set up a monitoring group of bankers
with Shri , Chief General Manager of Industrial and Export Credit
