Updated list of NBFCs

The Reserve Bank of India has updated the list of Non-Banking Financial Companies
including Residuary Non-Banking Companies which are registered with the Reserve
Bank and are permitted to accept public deposits and those whose applications for
registration are rejected and are, therefore, not allowed to accept public deposits. The list
updated till June 30, 1999 has been published on the Reserve Bank of India 
( URL : www.nbfclist.rbi.org.in). The list will be updated on the site every fortnight.
