Handbook of Statistics on Indian Economy is an ad hoc publication brought out in December
1998 by the Department of Economic Analysis and Policy of the Reserve Bank of India,
Mumbai.  This publication gives annual data on most of the major economic indicators from
1970-71 onwards, and data on monthly/quarterly basis in respect of the financial sector for
recent years, essentially to facilitate short term analysis.  Wherever possible, data on such
high frequency basis are provided from 1990-91 onwards.  There are 135 tables arranged in
two parts; part I containing annual series and part II monthly series.  Data relate to national
income, saving and investment, agriculture and industrial output, prices, money and banking,
financial markets, government finances, foreign trade, balance of payments and exchange
rates.  Data are compiled from both within the Reserve bank of India and from outside
published sources.
