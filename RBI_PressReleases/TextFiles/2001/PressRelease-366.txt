RBI clarification on Benares State Bank Limited
October 12, 2001
It may be recalled that the Reserve Bank had issued a directive under Section 35A of the
Banking Regulation Act, 1949, restraining the Benares State Bank Limited, among other
things, from making payments to depositors exceeding Rs.1000 as at the close of
business on September 25, 2001. The directive also stipulated that the bank was
permitted to pay salaries to its employees. It can also incur other necessary expenditure
for a sum not exceeding Rs. 2500 for carrying out day-to-day administration.
The Reserve Bank of India has today clarified that it had issued the directive on Benares
State Bank Limited in order to protect the interest of depositors. It has further stated that
insurance cover from the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation is
available to the depositor in respect of his deposits in the bank in the same capacity and
right to the extent of Rs. one lakh.
The Reserve Bank has also been permitting the bank to allow withdrawals in excess of
Rs. 1000 in certain genuine cases, such as, salaries of the staff and teachers of educational
institutions, credited to the deposit accounts before issue of RBI directive, the amounts
remittable by students towards university fees, etc. Pay orders and drafts drawn on or
before September 25, 2001 are also allowed to be paid, if presented over the counter.
