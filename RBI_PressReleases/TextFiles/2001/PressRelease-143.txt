Fresh OCB Investments under PIS prohibited
November 29, 2001
It has been decided that henceforth Overseas Corporate Bodies (OCBs) shall not
be permitted to invest under the Portfolio Investment Scheme (PIS) in India.
It is, however, clarified that OCBs will continue to enjoy the facilities of opening
non-resident accounts and making direct investment as permitted so far.  Further, the
OCBs that have already made investments under the Portfolio Investment Scheme, may
continue to hold such shares/convertible debentures till such time these are sold on the
stock exchange.
