presented data at aggregate level for all industries.
The publication on public limited companies consists of two parts -  the first part
comprising four chapters, briefly describing the scope of the studies, the sources of data, the
methodology and the concepts and definitions adopted while the second part consisting of
two volumes contains the statistical statements.
The publication is also available on a CD-ROM to facilitate easy recourse to data by

researchers and other users interested in this area.  From time to time the data contained in
these studies are consolidated and brought out as special publication.
