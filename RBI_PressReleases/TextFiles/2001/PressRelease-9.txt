under LAF on December 31, 2001
The Reserve Bank of India will conduct the daily repo and reverse repo auctions
and the fortnightly repo auction under the Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) on
December 31, 2001.  The LAF auctions will be conducted as per the following details :

Earlier, in the calendar announced for daily repo and reverse repo auctions and
fortnightly repo auctions under LAF, these auctions for December 31, 2001 were not
listed as normally the office of the Reserve Bank of India remains closed for public
transactions on December 31 for the half yearly closing of its accounts.  It has now been
decided to keep the Reserve Bank of India open for public transactions on December 31,
2001.  As such, the auctions under LAF will be conducted on this date.  The calendar
announced for daily repo and reverse repo auctions and fortnightly auction under LAF
stands modified to this extent.
