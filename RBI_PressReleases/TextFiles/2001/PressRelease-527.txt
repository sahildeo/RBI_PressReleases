September 15, 2001
1. In response to queries from the Press about the Reserve Bank of India's reaction to the
current international developments and their effect on  foreign exchange, money and
Government securities markets, the Reserve Bank of India, through its official spokesperson,
has stated that it expects any temporary hiccups to disappear and markets to function
normally as soon as the present international uncertainties  become clear.  As such, the
Reserve Bank of India does not intend to presently shift its monetary policy stance in regard
to keeping interest rates stable with adequate liquidity.
2. The Reserve Bank of India added that it would continue to watch the markets very
closely and will be prepared, as in the past, to sell foreign exchange directly or indirectly, if it
considers it necessary to do so, to meet any unusual supply-demand gap in view of the
prevailing uncertainties.  The spokesperson added that the Reserve Bank has more than
adequate liquidity in foreign exchange with its foreign exchange reserves  at all time high of
over US $45 billion.
