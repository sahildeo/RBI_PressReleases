Rs.20 Notes Without Inset Letter
September 21, 2001
The Reserve Bank of India will shortly be issuing Rs.20 notes in Mahatma
Gandhi Series without inset letter in numbering panels bearing the signature of Dr. Bimal
Jalan, Governor. Except for this change, the design of the Rs.20 denomination notes (in
the 'Mahatma Gandhi' Series) to be issued now is similar in all respects to those issued
earlier in the Mahatma Gandhi Series. All Rs.20 denomination notes issued  by the
Reserve Bank in the past will continue to be legal tender.
