Reserve Bank reduces Interest Rates on
Export Credit Across the Board
September 24, 2001
The Reserve Bank of India has announced reduction in interest rates for export credit
by 1.0 percentage point across the board.  This reduction will apply to both, pre-shipment and
post-shipment credits.
As per instructions issued by the Reserve Bank today, the maximum rate that the bank
should charge to exporters will be 2.5 percentage points below its prime lending rate for pre-
shipment credit up to 180 days and for post-shipment credit up to 90 days.  Earlier, the ceiling
rate was 1.5 percentage point below the prime lending rate.  This further concession will apply
in respect of all export credit granted by banks effective September 26, 2001 and up to March
31, 2002.
The Reserve Bank spokesperson added that in addition to the above facility for rupee
credit, exporters would continue to have the facility of foreign currency loans in the currency
of their choice at highly internationally competitive rates.  The rate for foreign currency loans
to exporters will continue to be LIBOR plus a maximum of 1.0 percentage point.  Thus,
currently dollar – denominated foreign currency loans can be availed by exporters at no higher
than 3.0 per cent (LIBOR rate) + 1.0 per cent, i.e., 4.0 per cent.
The spokesperson also added that even in regard to rupee loans, the exporter, while
availing the concessional credit, can sell the export proceeds in the forward market. Assuming
a PLR of 10.5 per cent, the ceiling for interest rate on export credit would be 8.0 per cent; and
adjusting for forward premia which are currently over 5 per cent, the effective interest rates to
exporters on rupee loans can also come down to as low as three per cent.
