Conversion to Euro Bank Notes and Coins
 
On January 1, 2002  Euro banknotes and coins will be put into circulation in the
12  member countries of the European Union and the 12 legacy currencies would cease to
be legal tender as per the time schedule set by the member countries.
Authorised dealers and full fledged money changers have been advised by the
Reserve Bank to display Euro exchange  rates for travellers’ cheques immediately and for
currency notes from  January 1,  2002  at their foreign exchange dealing branches,
especially those located at airports and tourist centres.
The Reserve Bank of India has also advised authorised dealers and full fledged
money changers that on introduction of Euro banknotes and coins,  they may  exchange
legacy  currencies held by residents  to the Euro.   Presently,  a  person resident in India is
permitted to retain foreign currency notes, bank notes and foreign currency travellers’
cheques not exceeding US$ 2000 or its equivalent, in aggregate. Accordingly, residents
holding balances of any of the 12 legacy currencies may convert these balances to the
Euro  till  January  31, 2002.
All information on the Euro is available on the European Central Bank web site
which can also be accessed through the 'Other Links' section on the RBI website
