September 18, 2001
In response to press queries, the official spokesperson of the Reserve Bank of India
confirmed that the RBI-SEBI Technical Committee on bank financing of equities met today
and discussed margin trading.
The spokesperson indicated that the Reserve Bank of India has decided to allow banks
to finance margin trading. It is proposed to allow banks to provide finance to stock brokers
for the purpose of margin trading in actively traded scrips which form part of the NSE-
NIFTY and BSE- SENSEX, within the overall existing ceiling for bank exposure to capital
market. The banks will be required to maintain a minimum margin of 40 per cent. The
Reserve Bank will announce detailed guidelines on the subject separately. These guidelines
will be operative for an initial period of 60 days and will be further refined in the light of
experience.
