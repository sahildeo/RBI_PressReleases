Currency notes and coins of Rs.2 and Rs.5
Denominations are Legal Tender
At certain locations in a few cities/towns, bill boards have appeared indicating that
the notes and coins of Rs.2 and Rs.5 denominations have ceased to be legal tender. The
report is baseless and misleading. The Reserve Bank of India clarifies that the notes and
coins of Rs.2 and Rs.5 continue to be legal tender. The members of public can freely accept
and transact their business in these notes and coins and need not to be misled by any such
propaganda.
