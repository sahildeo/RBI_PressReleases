Foreign  Currency - Rupee Swaps
Long term foreign currency - rupee swaps are presently available to corporates as a
hedging tool facilitating switching of foreign currency liability to domestic liability and
vice versa. Indian corporates which are borrowers of long term foreign currency loans
and those engaged in implementing turnkey projects overseas are able to properly
manage their foreign exchange and interest rate risks and reduce overall cost by using this
product.
Currently, banks have complete freedom to put through such swap transactions on behalf
of their clients on a matched basis, i.e, between two corporates, one having preference for
foreign currency and interest rate risk and the other for domestic risk, without any limit.
Banks are also currently allowed to undertake swap operations on behalf their clients on
an unmatched basis up to USD 10 million on the basis of prior permission from the
Reserve Bank.
It has now been decided to allow banks to undertake such transactions without any prior
permission from the Reserve Bank. Further, banks would also have greater freedom to
utilise higher limits up to USD 25 million for undertaking such operations on an
unmatched basis. Banks wishing to undertake such operations would only need to inform
Exchange Control Department, Reserve Bank of India, Central Office, Forex Market
Division, Mumbai (E-mail id: rbecdfmd@bol.net.in, Fax No.2611427) about the limits
that they propose to utilise for the purpose.
This liberalised facility will be available to the ADs until further notice. Necessary
instructions are being issued.
