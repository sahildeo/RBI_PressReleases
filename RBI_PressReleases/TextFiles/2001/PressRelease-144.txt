Booking of Forward Contracts based on Past Performance
November 29, 2001
It has been decided that authorised dealers may now allow booking of forward
contracts to exporters and importers without the production of documents evidencing
exposure to foreign exchange risk provided, at any point of time, such contracts outstanding
do not exceed 25 per cent of the eligible limit worked out on the basis of the average of the
previous three years export/import turnover, subject to a cap of US $ 50 million.
This liberalised facility would be available until further notice.  Necessary operating
instructions are being issued.
At present corporates have the freedom to hedge their foreign exchange exposures by
using various products like forward contracts, swaps and options only in respect of
crystalised exposures.  In other words, they are required to produce documentary evidence in
support of such exposures to be able to access the various products.
Exporters and importers often face situations where based on past performance they
are certain to enter into foreign exchange commitments in the near future.  In the absence of
documents evidencing firm commitments, however, they are unable to hedge such risks.  It
was felt that the facility of booking forward contracts based on past performance without
having to produce documents upfront would enable exporters/importers to take hedging
decisions in a dynamic manner.  Proper use of this facility would not only help minimise
risks for the corporates but could also lead to overall reduction in the cost of operations thus
enhancing their competitiveness.
