Government of India announces issue of Floating Rate Bonds, 2009
The Government of India has announced sale of "Floating Rate Bonds, 2009" for
an aggregate amount of Rs 3,000 crore (nominal) by auction.
The Floating Rate Bonds will be of 8-years tenure and will be issued at par. (i.e.
at Rs100.00).  The Bonds will carry an interest rate, which is calculated by adding a
'spread' to a variable base rate. The 'spread'   will be decided in the auction to be
conducted by the Reserve Bank of India and will remain unchanged during the currency
of the Bond. The variable base rate will be the average rate of the implicit yields at cut-
off prices emerging in the immediate previous six auctions of ‘Government of India 364
day Treasury Bills’ held prior to the relative half-year coupon period. The interest will be
paid every half year.  The base rate for calculation of interest for the first coupon period
commencing from December 6, 2001 to June 5, 2002 as per the aforesaid formula is 6.99
per cent (Please see illustration). The base rate for the subsequent half yearly coupon
periods, worked out as per the aforesaid formula, will be announced by RBI on or before
the commencement of the respective coupon period.
In the unlikely event of 364-day Treasury Bill auctions being discontinued during
the currency of the Floating Rate Bonds, the applicable  variable base rate will be the
average of the Yield to Maturity (YTM) rate prevailing for one year Govt. of India
Security as on last six reporting Fridays prior to the commencement of the relative half-
yearly coupon period, worked out in consultation with the Fixed Income Money Market
and Derivatives Association of India (FIMMDA). In case particular Friday/s is/are
holiday/s, the yield to maturity rates as on the previous working day shall be taken. This
rate will be announced by the RBI on or before the commencement of the relative half
yearly coupon period.
There will be no floor or cap on the interest rate on the Floating Rate Bonds.
