RBI lowers Ceiling on NBFC Deposit Rates
October 31, 2001
The Reserve Bank of India today announced a revision in the maximum rate of interest
which the non-banking financial companies can offer on their public deposits. Taking into
account the market conditions and changes in other interest rates in the system, the maximum
rate of interest that NBFCs can pay on their public deposits has been reduced, effective from
November 1, 2001 from 14 per cent to 12.5 per cent per annum. Other stipulations regarding the
interest rate remain unchanged.
The new ceiling of 12.5 per cent per annum on interest rate has also been extended to
miscellaneous non-banking companies (chit fund companies) and nidhi companies as applicable
to the deposits accepted by them as per the directions prescribed by RBI.
The new rates will be applicable only to fresh deposits and renewal of existing deposits
on and from November 1, 2001 by the NBFCs.
