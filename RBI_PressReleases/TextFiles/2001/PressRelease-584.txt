September 4, 2001
The Reserve Bank of India has stated that it will function as usual on September
6, 2001 and will try to provide, to the extent possible, the required services to its
constituents and public on that day in the event of a section of its employees going on
strike.
The All India Reserve Bank Employees Association (AIRBEA) representing
Class III employees of the Reserve Bank has given a call to its members to resort to strike
on Thursday, September 6, 2001. The Reserve Bank has stated that efforts, including a
conciliatory meeting under the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 on September 5, are being
made to resolve the issues.  As such, strike by Class III employees, if resorted to, will be
illegal.  In any case, all its offices will remain open on September 6, 2001 and it will try
to provide the required services to its constituents and public.
