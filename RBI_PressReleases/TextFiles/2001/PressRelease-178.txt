Passport need not be endorsed for forex release
November 23, 2001
With a view to further simplifying the procedure, it has now been decided that
authorised dealers need not endorse on passport the exchange released to persons
travelling abroad for tourism.  Accordingly, on the basis of a declaration given by the
traveller regarding the amount of foreign exchange availed of during a calendar year,
authorised dealers may release exchange for travel for tourism and private purposes.
Travellers can, however, seek endorsement on their passports, of foreign exchange
released, at their option if they consider it necessary for their record.
At present, it is mandatory for authorised dealers to endorse on the traveller's
passport the foreign exchange released for travel for tourism and private purposes.
