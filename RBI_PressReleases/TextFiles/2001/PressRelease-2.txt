From January 1, 2002 the Reserve Bank of India will announce Reference Rate
for Euro in addition to Reference Rate for the US dollar. The Reserve Bank of India has
been announcing the indicative exchange rate for the Euro since January 1, 1999.
Euro will become effective from January 1, 2002 when Euro bank notes and coins
will be put into circulation in twelve member countries of the European Union. The
twelve countries which are members of the European Union are Portugal, Belgium,
Netherland, Ireland, Austria, Germany, Finland, France, Luxemburg, Greece, Italy and
Spain.
The Reserve Bank of India has also advised foreign exchange dealers and full
fledged money changers to display, from January 1, 2002, the exchange rates for the
Euro. The display of exchange rate will have to be in all foreign exchange dealing
branches especially those located at airports and tourist centres. Authorised dealers and
full fledged money changers will also sell and purchase Euro currency and travellers
cheques once Euro becomes effective from January 1, 2002.
Residents are allowed to retain unspent foreign exchange up to US$2000 or
equivalent under Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999. Residents are required to
exchange such unspent legacy currency through any authorised dealer or full fledged
money changer before January 31, 2002.  Beyond this date the exchange facility will be
available if the authorised dealers and full fledged money changers have arrangements in
place to realise the value for legacy currencies.
