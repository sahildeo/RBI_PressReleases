Calendar for LAF Auctions
October 31, 2001
Background
    The scheme of Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) was introduced in June
2000. The scheme has stabilised and is working satisfactorily with certain
modifications introduced in the original scheme from time to time.  Since the
inception of the scheme, the Reserve Bank has been regularly making announcement
of repo and reverse repo auctions under LAF, through Press Release, on a daily basis
with a view to disseminating procedural details for participation in LAF auctions.
These procedural details for participating in LAF auctions are by now fully known to
the market participants. These details are also available in the circular dated May 3,
2001 issued by the Reserve Bank on 'Scheme of Liquidity Adjustment Facility: 2001-
2002'.
     As the system stabilised, it was decided that a quarterly calendar of
Repo/Reverse Repo auctions, giving the dates, periods, etc. of the daily auctions over
a period, will replace the daily announcement /Press release. Accordingly, a calendar
indicating the period of repo and reverse repo auctions under LAF for every working
day of the current year was issued on October 15,2001 in terms of Press Release No.
2001-2002/470. The calendar is also available on the RBI Web site.
     In order to familiarise the market participants with the new LAF auction
calendar, the daily press release /announcement is also being issued in the usual
course, duly sensitising them that the daily announcement will be discontinued after
October 31, 2001.
Daily Press Release on LAF to be Discontinued (effective October 31,2001)
    In view of dissemination of information on LAF auctions on different dates
through the calendar, the daily Press Release will not be issued any further. For ready
reference of the market participants, the LAF auction calendar uptil December 31,
2001 is again reproduced below.
    The LAF auction calendar would only be indicative in nature. In case of any
departure, in duration or any other parameter of LAF auction on a particular date, (on
account of unexpected holiday/s or for any other reasons) the necessary Press
Release, showing the revised position, would be issued and would also be posted on
the RBI Web site, as at present. In case, however, the modification is of permanent
nature, the calendar would be modified accordingly.
    As announced in the Monetary and Credit Policy 2001-02, the Reserve Bank will
have an option  (i) to switchover to fixed rate repos on overnight basis once in a
while as and when considered necessary and (ii) to introduce longer-term repos up to
14 days period as and when required. In such cases, whenever the Reserve Bank
decides to conduct such special repo operations, specific Press Releases will also be
issued through news agencies and RBI's Web site.
