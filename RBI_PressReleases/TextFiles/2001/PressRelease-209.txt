Government of India announces issue of Floating Rate Bonds, 2006
November 15, 2001
The Government of India have announced sale of "Floating Rate Bonds, 2006"
for an aggregate amount of Rs 2,000 crore (nominal) by auction.
The Floating Rate Bonds will be of 5-years tenure and will be issued at par. (i.e.
at Rs100.00 per cent).  The Bonds will carry an interest rate, which is calculated by
adding a 'markup' to a variable base rate. The 'mark up'   will be decided in the
auction to be conducted by Reserve Bank of India and will remain unchanged during the
currency of the bond. The variable base rate will be the average rate of the implicit yields
at cut-off prices emerging in the immediate previous six auctions of ‘Government of
India 364 day Treasury Bills’ held prior to the relative half-year coupon period. The
interest will be paid every half year.  The base rate for calculation of interest for the first
coupon period commencing from November 22, 2001 to May 21, 2002 as per the
aforesaid formula is 7.06 per cent (Please see illustration enclosed). The base rate for the
subsequent half yearly coupon periods, worked out as per the aforesaid formula, will be
announced by RBI on or before the commencement of the respective coupon period.
In the unlikely event of 364-day Treasury Bill auctions being discontinued during
the currency of the Floating Rate Bonds, the applicable  variable base rate will be the
average of the Yield to Maturity (YTM) rate prevailing for one year Govt. of India
Security as on last six reporting Fridays prior to the commencement of the relative half-
yearly coupon period, worked out in consultation with the Fixed Income Money Market
and Derivatives Association of India (FIMMDA). This rate will be announced by RBI on
or before the commencement of the relative half yearly coupon period.
There will be no floor or cap on the interest rate on the Floating Rate Bonds.
The Floating Rate Bonds are being issued by the Government of India, on auction
basis for the first time. The bonds provide hedge against interest rate risk, offering returns
linked to short term yield.
