Rs.20 Notes With Inset Letter
October 29, 2001
The Reserve Bank of India will shortly be issuing Rs.20 notes in Mahatma
Gandhi Series with capital letter "R" inset in both numbering panels bearing the signature
of Dr. Bimal Jalan, Governor. Except for this change, the design of the Rs.20
denomination notes (in the 'Mahatma Gandhi' Series) to be issued now is similar in all
respects to those issued earlier in the Mahatma Gandhi Series. All Rs.20 denomination
notes issued  by the  Reserve Bank in the past will continue to be legal tender.
