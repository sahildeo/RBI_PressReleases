Western Co-operative Bank Ltd., Mumbai Licence Cancelled
October 31, 2001
The Reserve Bank of India has cancelled the licence of the Western Co-operative
Bank Ltd., Mumbai, Maharashtra to carry on banking business in India.  The bank is,
therefore, precluded from transacting the business of ‘banking’ as defined in the Banking
Regulation Act, 1949 (as applicable to Co-operative Societies). Thus, it will not be in order
for it, among other things, to accept deposits from the public and allow withdrawals by
cheque, draft, order or otherwise.
