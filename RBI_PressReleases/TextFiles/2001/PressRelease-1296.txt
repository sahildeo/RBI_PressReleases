The Reserve Bank of India will shortly be issuing Rs.100/- notes in Mahatma
Gandhi series with capital letter `B' inset in both numbering panels bearing the signature
of Dr.Bimal Jalan, Governor. Except for this change the design of Rs 100/- notes to be
issued now is similar in all respects to those issued earlier in the Mahatma Gandhi series.
All Rs.100/- denomination notes issued by the Bank in the past will continue to be legal
tender.
