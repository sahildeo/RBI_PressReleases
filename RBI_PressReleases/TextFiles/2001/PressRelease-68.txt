Acquisition of Shares under ESOP
December 15, 2001
Authorised dealers are permitted to allow remittance of foreign exchange by employees
of wholly owned subsidiaries or branch offices of the foreign company or a company in
which the shareholding of a foreign company is not less than 51 per cent, for purchase of
shares of the foreign company offered under Employees Stock Option Scheme (ESOP).
Such remittances are permitted provided the ESOPs are offered at a concession and
subject to the ceiling prescribed.
It is clarified that such remittances for acquisition of shares under ESOP will be permitted
irrespective of whether the concession is being borne by the foreign company, its wholly
owned subsidiary or office in India or a company in which foreign share holding is not
less than 51 per cent.
