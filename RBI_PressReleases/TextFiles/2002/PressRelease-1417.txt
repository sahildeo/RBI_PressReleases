Inclusion of Euro as an Additional Intervention Currency
March 4, 2002
In the wake of introduction of euro in January 1999, the Reserve Bank of India
has taken a number of important measures such as notifying euro as a permissible
transaction currency, advising banks to extend facilities to residents to convert balances
in legacy currencies to euro balances, advising banks to accept FCNR deposits in euro,
providing all information on euro on RBI website, announcing reference rate for euro (in
addition to US dollar) etc.
As a further step in this direction, the Government of India has now issued a
notification {S.O.235(E) dated February 27, 2002} providing Reserve Bank of India with
the option to use euro as an additional currency for operation / intervention (in addition to
US dollar).  The Reserve Bank of India would now be in a position to sell or buy euro
also for operational purposes as and when considered necessary in future in the light of
international developments.  The present notification has been issued in supersession of
the earlier notification issued by the Government of India on February 27, 1993. The
present notification has also included two new centres of Hyderabad and Nagpur for sale
and purchase of US dollar and euro by the Reserve Bank of India for delivery in New
York and Frankfurt respectively in addition to existing centres.
