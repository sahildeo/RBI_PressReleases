Higher Open Position Limits to Authorised Dealers
August 9, 2002
Authorised Dealers (ADs) are allowed to maintain foreign exchange open positions
which is the AD's foreign exchange exposure representing the mismatch between foreign
currency purchase and sales as also balance sheet mismatches. At present banks are permitted
to maintain overnight, the Open Position Limits fixed by Banks' management and approved
by the Reserve Bank of India. The open positions are necessary for better manoeuverability
in foreign exchange operations facilitating two-way price quotes and also finer rates to
customers.
Towards providing better customer service and as a further measure of liberalisation,
the Reserve Bank has decided to consider need based requests from ADs for higher overnight
open position limits. Banks desirous of availing the facility may approach Chief General
Manager, Exchange Control Department, Central Office, Forex Markets Division, Mumbai
after getting the enhancement approved by their own Boards.
This facility will be available until further notice.
