Facilities for 'Status Holder' Exporters
April 1, 2002
With a view to simplifying the procedures and reducing the transaction cost of
exports, the Reserve Bank of India has decided to extend the following special facilities
to exporters with a proven track record and certified as “Status Holder” as per the EXIM
policy announced by the Government :
(i) The Status Holder exporters will enjoy freedom to credit upto 100 per
cent, as against the existing limit of 50 per cent, of their foreign exchange
receipts to their Exchange Earners’ Foreign Currency (EEFC) Accounts.
(ii) Such exporters will also have extended period of one year from the date of
shipment to realise export proceeds.  Under the existing regulations, a
period of only six months was available for realisation of export proceeds.
(iii) These exporters will also have freedom to directly dispatch the shipping
documents to their importer clients outside India without any prior
permission from the Reserve Bank.
These facilities will be available with effect from April 01, 2002, till further
notice.
It is expected that these special facilities to “Status Holder” exporters will
considerably facilitate their foreign exchange operations and provide them with flexibility
to meet all their export-connected requirements without delay.
