Restoration of the Facility of Rebooking
of Cancelled Forward Contracts
March 26, 2002
Presently resident corporates have total freedom to hedge their crystallized exposures
through forward contracts. Such contracts can also be freely cancelled.
As a further facility, it has been decided to extend the freedom of rebooking of cancelled
forward contracts covering exposures arising out of import and non-trade transactions
upto 100 per cent of the unhedged exposures (including contracts cancelled earlier)
falling due within one year, subject to a cap of US dollar 100 million in a financial year
per corporate.
This liberalisation is expected to enable resident corporates to undertake active risk
management and to bring about an overall reduction in their cost of operations without
disturbing the market.
This liberalized  facility would be available to resident corporates from April 1, 2002
until further notice. Necessary instructions are being issued to the Authorised Dealers.
It is clarified that exporters would continue to enjoy the current facility of rebooking
cancelled contracts without any limit.
