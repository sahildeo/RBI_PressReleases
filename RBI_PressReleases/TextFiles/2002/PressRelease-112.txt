In view of the prevailing liquidity conditions, it has been decided to enhance the
notified amount in the auctions of 91 day Treasury Bills from the present Rs.250 crore to
Rs.1000 crore for four auctions starting from December 11, 2002 to January 1, 2003. The
position will be reviewed thereafter.
It has also been decided to change the format of the auction of 91 day Treasury Bills
from the present uniform price format to multiple price format for the four auctions from
December 11, 2002 to January 1, 2003. The position will be reviewed thereafter.
The notified amount and the present format of auction of 364 day Treasury Bills  will
remain unchanged.
Accordingly, the Calendar for Auction of Government of India Treasury Bills from
December 11, 2002 to January 1, 2003 would be revised as under:

changes, if any, will be communicated through regular press releases.
The auction of treasury bills will be subject to the terms and conditions specified
