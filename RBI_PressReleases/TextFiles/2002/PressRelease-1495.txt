February 15, 2002
In regard to the recent developments concerning Rupee Co-operative Bank Ltd., Pune,
the Reserve Bank's official spokesperson has issued the following statement:
The Reserve Bank of India is in full agreement with the steps taken by the Registrar
of Co-operative Societies, and the Government of Maharashtra for ensuring efficient
functioning of the bank in the interest of its depositors and members.  The action against the
Board of Directors was taken recently in view of irregularities committed by the Board to the
detriment of the bank and against the interests of depositors.  Except for the irregular
transactions by its erstwhile management, contrary to RBI guidelines, the liquidity position of
the bank continues to be comfortable and its overall financial health is not a cause of concern
for depositors.
The Reserve Bank is in close touch with the Administrator and is fully supportive of
the new management in ensuring full safety of depositors' funds, sufficient liquidity, and
financial viability of the bank.
For the information of the depositors, it may also be mentioned that the deposits in the
bank upto Rs.1 lakh are fully insured under the insurance cover of Deposit Insurance and
Credit Guarantee Corporation.
