NRIs/PIOs can now pay Credit Card Dues from their NRO Funds
Non Resident Indians (NRIs)/Persons of Indian Origin (PIOs) can now settle the
dues of their international credit cards out of funds they hold in their Non-resident
(Ordinary) Rupee (NRO) Account. The NRIs/PIOs will be able to settle credit card dues
out of their NRO funds for the credit cards issued by the banks in India and to the extent
of the limit fixed on their cards by the issuing bank.
Earlier, NRIs/PIOs were required to settle charges on the use of their international
credit card only out of inward remittances or balance held in their Non-Resident
(External) Rupee (NRE) Accounts/Foreign Currency (Non-Resident) { FCNR(B)}
Accounts (Banks).
The Reserve Bank of India has allowed the facility of settlement of credit card
charges out of funds held by NRIs/PIOs in their Non-Resident (Ordinary) Rupee Account
with a view to liberalising the exchange control regulations and providing additional
facility to them.
The Reserve Bank of India has already issued instructions to this effect to banks
on December 9, 2002.
