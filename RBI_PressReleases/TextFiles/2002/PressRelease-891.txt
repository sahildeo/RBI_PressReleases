RBI develops a Short-Term Liquidity Forecasting Model
June 24, 2002
The Reserve Bank of India has developed the generic form of a short term model for liquidity
assessment to evaluate the short term interaction of financial markets and monetary policy
measures. As Announced in the Monetary and Credit Policy for the year 2002-2003, the
model has been developed under the guidance of an expert Advisory Group comprising
Professors D. M. Nachane and M. J. M. Rao, University of Mumbai, Vikas Chitre, Gokhale
Institute of Politics and Economics, Mihir Rakshit, Investment Information and Credit Rating
Agency Ltd., Indira Rajaraman, Institute of Economic Growth and K. Krishnamurty,
Administrative Staff College of India.
The performance of the model has been tested and it appears to be satisfactory although
further refinements may be warranted. Efforts will be devoted towards the improvement of
the model on an ongoing basis depending on the advice received from the Advisory Group
and other comments and suggestions received in this regard from academics, practitioners
and market players.
The model has been placed on the Reserve Bank's website www.rbi.org.in for wider
dissemination and public debate. Comments and suggestions on the Report may be forwarded
to the Adviser-in-Charge, Monetary Policy Department, Reserve Bank of India, Central
Office, Mumbai or by e-mail helpmpd@rbi.org.in or fax at 022-265 1685 / 022-269 3204 /
