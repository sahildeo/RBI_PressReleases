Facilities to NRIs/PIOs and Residents
July 2, 2002
With a view to liberalising the exchange control regulations and providing
additional facilities to non-resident Indians/Persons of Indian Origin (NRIs/PIOs), the
Reserve Bank of India has decided to allow the facility of repatriation of funds out of
balances held by them in their Non-Resident Ordinary Rupee (NRO) Accounts for the
following purposes :
(i) Upto US$ 30,000 per academic year to meet expenses in connection with
education of their children,
(ii) Upto US$ 100,000 to meet the medical expenses abroad of the account holder or
his family members, and
(iii) Upto US$ 100, 000 per year representing sale proceeds of immovable property
held by them for a period of not less than 10 years.
Applications for such remittances may be made to the authorised dealers in
foreign exchange.
At present, residents proceeding abroad on emigration are released exchange by
authorised dealers to the extent of US$ 5,000 or amount prescribed by the country of
emigration. In order to facilitate setting up base abroad, the Reserve Bank of India has
decided to enhance this limit to US$25,000 to residents, who have obtained emigration
visa.
A notification for carrying out suitable amendments in the regulations is being
issued and on its publication in the Official Gazette, it would be possible for NRIs/PIOs
to effect such remittances without the prior approval of the Reserve Bank.  Until further
notice, applications for such remittances may be made to the Regional Offices of the
Exchange Control Department of the Reserve Bank.
