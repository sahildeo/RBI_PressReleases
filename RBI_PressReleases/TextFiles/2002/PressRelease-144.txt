Borrowing and Lending Operations of Banks in Call/Notice Money Market
November 30, 2002
Deputy Governor Dr. Rakesh Mohan held a meeting in the Reserve Bank of India
today with bank chairmen and treasury heads to assess the impact of the first stage of
prudential limits on borrowing and lending operations of commercial banks in call/notice
money market implemented from October 5, 2002.
The meeting also discussed the implementation of the second stage with effect
from the fortnight beginning December 14, 2002. There was unanimous agreement
regarding the implementation of the second stage.
Among other issues, bankers expressed concern that the stipulated limit of 80 per
cent of required CRR amount to be met on a daily basis since November 16, 2002, could
lead to a certain level of inflexibility in their funds management.  Deputy Governor
agreed to examine this issue.
For the development of the repo market, bankers emphasized on early resolution
to uniform documentation and issues related to rollover of repos and broad basing the
eligibility of repoable securities.
