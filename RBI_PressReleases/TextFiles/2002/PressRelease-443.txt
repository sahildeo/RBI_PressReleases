RBI to function normally on September 30, 2002
September 26, 2002
The Reserve Bank of India has stated that its offices in Mumbai and Navi Mumbai
will conduct normal business on Monday, September 30, 2002. Commercial banks and co-
operative banks will, however, remain closed for public on that day on account of half-yearly
closing of their accounts. There will, therefore, be no clearing on that day at the
Brihanmumbai Bankers' Clearing House. The settlement of MICR cheques presented on
September 28 will be done on Tuesday, October 1, 2002 (September 29, 2002 being Sunday).
