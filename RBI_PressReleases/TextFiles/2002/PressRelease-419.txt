RBI Modifies NBFC Regulations
October 1, 2002
The Reserve Bank of India today announced that non-banking financial
companies (NBFCs) should necessarily hold their investments in Government Securities
only in dematerialised form, either in a Constituent's Subsidiary General Ledger Account
(CSGL) with a scheduled commercial bank / Stock Holding Corporation of India Ltd. or
with a depository.  The NBFCs have been permitted, as a special case, time up to October
31, 2002 to dematerialise the securities/bonds held by them in physical form. No further
transaction should be undertaken by them in physical form with any broker. The NBFCs
would not require prior permission of the Reserve Bank for opening their demat account
with a depository approved by Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) or its
participants. They should, however, within a week of their doing so, inform the Reserve
Bank.
NBFCs have further been directed to include in their advertisements the fact that
deposits solicited by them are not insured, to avoid any possible misunderstanding by the
prospective depositors.
All NBFCs having public deposits of Rs.50 crore and above as on March 31, 2002
have been directed to submit a quarterly return on their capital market exposure.  The first
such return should be submitted for the quarter ending December 31, 2002.
The Reserve Bank has also directed all NBFCs not holding public deposits to
inform invariably, within 30 days, of any change in the registered office of the company
or in the  names of directors/principal officers or its auditors.
