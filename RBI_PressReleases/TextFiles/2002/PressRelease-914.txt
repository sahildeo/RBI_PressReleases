June 18, 2002
The Reserve Bank of India in paragraph 3, of its Circular AP(DIR Series) No.19
dated October 30, 2000, had indicated that Credit Cards, ATM Cards and Debit Cards
etc, being only different methods of payment, all Rules/Regulations and directions issued
under the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 (FEMA), apply to Credit Cards,
Debit Cards and ATM Cards etc. also.
With a view to clarifying the permissible uses of International Credit Cards on
Internet, it is clarified that :-
(i) International Credit Cards can be used on Internet for any purpose for which
exchange can be purchased from an Authorised Dealer in India, e.g. for
import of books, purchase of downloadable softwares or import of any other
item permissible under EXIM Policy.
(ii) International Credit Cards cannot be used on Internet or otherwise for
purchase of prohibited items, like for purchase lottery tickets, banned or
proscribed magazines, participation in sweepstakes, payment for call-back
services etc., since no drawal of foreign exchange is permitted for such
items/activities.
(iii) There is no aggregate monetary ceiling separately prescribed for use of
International Credit Cards through Internet.
It is further clarified that Debit Cards and ATM Cards can also be used for any
purpose for which foreign exchange can be purchased from an Authorised Dealer in
