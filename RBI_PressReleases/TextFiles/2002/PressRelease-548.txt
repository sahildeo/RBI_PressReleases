RBI tells Banks to distribute Coins/Exchange Soiled Notes  to Public on Sunday
September 3, 2002
As one more initiative in implementing ‘Clean Note Policy’,  the Reserve Bank of
India has advised banks to consider keeping a few of their currency chests branches open
on one Sunday in a month to provide exclusively few counters for  currency note
exchange facilities and distribute coins to the members of public.  In a letter written last
week to the banks, the Reserve Bank of India Deputy Governor, Shri Vepa Kamesam,
has stated that the facilities of exchange should be available on Sunday only to
individuals. The Deputy Governor has advised banks to run the campaign initially for
three months from September  on an experimental basis at select pilot centres. The
Reserve Bank has left the choice of selection of branches on the basis of their assessment
of the scarcity of coins and circulation of soiled notes in the area and give feedback to it
on a monthly basis regarding success of the campaign.
Taking cue from the central bank's advice, one bank has already initiated steps for
distribution of coins in exchange for soiled and mutilated notes  on first Sunday of
September at  Bangalore, Hyderabad, Calicut, Chennai and this would continue for three
months.
Apart from providing good quality currency notes to members of public from the
four currency note printing presses on a much larger scale, the Reserve Bank has also
focussed on withdrawal of soiled notes from circulation. To facilitate easy exchange of
mutilated notes, it had, in 1986, delegated full powers under the Note Refund Rules to all
branches of public sector banks including non-currency chest branches.  Last week, the
central bank also invited applications from public organisations, such as, public sector
undertakings, regional rural banks, cooperative banks, reputed and national/regional level
social welfare organisations to apply for assisting in the endeavour to reach coins to their
clients/members.  The select Sunday exchange counters spread across the country of
public sector banks should mitigate the hardship experienced at upcountry centres.
