Trading in Government Securities on the Stock Exchanges
Public Comments on the Draft Scheme invited
December 26, 2002
It is proposed to introduce trading in government securities on the stock
exchanges in order to encourage wider participation of all classes of investors across the
country, including retail investors. A scheme for implementation has been prepared in
mutual consultation with the Ministry of Finance and Company Affairs, the Securities
and Exchange Board of India and the Reserve Bank of India.
The scheme envisages that trading in Government securities will be done in the
same manner in which trading takes place in equities through a nationwide, anonymous,
order driven, screen based trading system of the stock exchanges. This facility will be in
addition to the present system of dealing in government securities through the Negotiated
Dealing System (NDS) of the RBI.
The scheme is being placed simultaneously on the websites of the Ministry of
Finance and Company Affairs (www.finmin.nic.in), the RBI (www.rbi.org.in) and the
SEBI (www.sebi.gov.in) for comments from the public. Comments may be sent latest by
January 9, 2003 to ssaksena@finance.nic.in; or to mailto:pkb@sebi.gov.in; or to
cgmidmc@rbi.org.in These comments will be taken into account before taking a final
decision in the matter.
