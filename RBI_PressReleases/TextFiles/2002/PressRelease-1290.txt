Cut-Off date for NDS Membership extended up to May 31, 2002
March 30, 2002
The Reserve Bank of India has decided to extend the cut-off date for banks and other
institutions joining the Negotiated Dealing System (NDS), up to May 31, 2002. This is done after
a review of representations received from various institutions regarding the earlier cut-off date of
March 31, 2002. The Reserve Bank has also informed banks and other institutions, having SGL
accounts with Public Debt Office (PDO)/Public Accounts Department (PAD) of the Reserve
Bank, Mumbai, that no further extension of time will be given.
Non-bank participants including financial institutions having SGL accounts which do not
become members of NDS by May 31, 2002 will have to close their SGL account with RBI and
undertake transactions through CSGL accounts.  All scheduled banks having SGL accounts with
RBI including scheduled cooperative banks will have to necessarily become members of NDS by
May 31, 2002.  Accordingly, the settlement at PDO/PAD, RBI Mumbai will be done only
through electronic SGL transfer form generated by NDS with effect from June 1, 2002.
The Reserve Bank of India had, on February 26, 2002, communicated that the entities
maintaining SGL accounts at PDO/PAD, RBI Mumbai, who had at that time not joined NDS,
should become NDS members latest by March 31, 2002. This was necessary for a smooth
transition from physical SGL to electronic SGL transfer form for settlement.
