March 11, 2002
The Reserve Bank of India has extended the facility of reduction in the ceiling of
interest rates charged by scheduled commercial banks on pre-shipment and post-shipment
rupee export credit for a further period of six months upto September 30, 2002.
It may be recalled that the Reserve Bank had, in September last, announced a
reduction in the ceiling of interest rates for export credit by one percentage point across
the board. The reduction was applicable to both, pre-shipment and post-shipment credits.
It was also mentioned at that time that the dispensation would be valid up to March 31,
2002.
Considering subsequent developments, the facility of reduced interest rates to
export credit has now been extended for a further period of six months. Thus, the validity
of the reduction in the interest rates on export credit announced on September 24, 2001,
would remain in force upto September 30, 2002.
The maximum rate that the banks could charge to exporters is 2.5 percentage
points below its prime lending rate for pre-shipment credit up to 180 days and for post-
shipment credit upto 90 days.
