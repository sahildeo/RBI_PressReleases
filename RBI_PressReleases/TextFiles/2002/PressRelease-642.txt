EEFC Accounts for Professionals
August 15, 2002
The Reserve Bank of India has now decided to permit individual professionals to
keep up to 100 per cent of their foreign exchange earnings from consultancy and other
services rendered to persons or bodies outside India, in their foreign exchange earners’
foreign currency (EEFC) account. The facility is permitted for the benefit and
convenience of individual professionals, such as, scientists, professors of Indian
universities/institutions, economists, lawyers, doctors, artists, architects, engineers,
consultants, cost/chartered accountants, directors on boards of overseas companies, etc.
This would enable the professionals to use the funds from these accounts to meet their
foreign exchange requirements without any prior approval of the Reserve Bank.
Currently, residents in India are permitted to maintain exchange earner’ foreign
currency (EEFC) accounts with banks in India, out of a portion of their earnings in
foreign exchange. Exchange earners’ foreign currency accounts can be opened and
maintained with any branch of a bank dealing in foreign exchange. Cheque facilities are
also available for operations in the EEFC accounts.
The Reserve Bank has stated that applications from professionals for availing this
facility, may be forwarded by the concerned bank branches to the regional offices of its
exchange control department.
