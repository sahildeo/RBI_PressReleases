RBI extends Special Financial Package for
Large Value Exports by One Year
September 28, 2002
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has extended the special financial package for large
value exports by one year. The package will now be valid up to September 30, 2003.
The RBI had, in September last year, offered the special financial package for large
value exports of select products, which are internationally competitive and have high value
addition. The RBI had, at that time, stated that the package would be valid for a period of one
year up to September 30, 2002. The package was extended for large value exports of 10
select products, viz. pharmaceuticals, agro chemicals, transport equipment, cement, iron and
steel, electrical machinery, aluminium, petroleum products, sugar and foodgrains.
The special financial package includes credit for periods up to 365 days at pre-
shipment as well as post-shipment stage as against 270 days and 180 days available to the
normal pre-shipment and post-shipment credit, respectively and the same rate of interest as
that applicable to normal pre-shipment and post-shipment credit even for the period extended
beyond 270 days and 180 days for pre-shipment and post-shipment credit, respectively.
