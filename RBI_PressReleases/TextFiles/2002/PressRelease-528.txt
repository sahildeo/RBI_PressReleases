Procedure for Release of Foreign Exchange for Medical
Treatment Abroad Liberalised
September 6, 2002
With a view to enabling residents to avail of foreign exchange for medical
treatment abroad without any hassles and any loss of time, it has now been decided that
authorised dealers may release foreign exchange upto US$50,000, for medical treatment
outside India, without insisting on any estimate from a doctor or hospital, on the basis of
a declaration of requirement given by the applicant, provided the payment for purchase of
such foreign exchange is being made by cheque or by debit to the applicants account.
Under the existing Regulations residents can purchase foreign exchange from
authorised dealers in India for medical treatment outside India, on production of an
estimate from a doctor or hospital giving the likely expenses involved in the treatment.
The Reserve Bank has been reviewing the existing rules and regulations relating
to the foreign exchange transactions by residents in India, and a number of measures have
been taken in the recent past towards procedural simplifications and liberalisation of the
existing procedures. As a further step in this direction, the procedure for release of
foreign exchange for medical treatment is being simplified.
Detailed guidelines on revised procedure are being issued to authorised dealers.
