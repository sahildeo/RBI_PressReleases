The Local Area Bank (LAB) Scheme was introduced in August 1996 pursuant
to the announcement of the then Finance Minister in  his budget speech. Following
this, guidelines for setting up  of Local Area Banks (LABs) in the private sector were
announced by the Reserve Bank on August 24, 1996. These banks were expected to
bridge the gaps in credit  availability and enhance the institutional credit framework in
the rural and semi-urban areas  and provide efficient and competitive financial
intermediation services in their area of operation.  Four LABs are  now functioning.
