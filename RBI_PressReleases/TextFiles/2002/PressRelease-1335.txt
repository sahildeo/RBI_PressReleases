RBI liberalises norms for
issue and pricing of shares of private sector banks
March 20, 2002
The Reserve Bank of India today liberalised the norms for issue and pricing of
shares by private sector banks. According to the revised norms, all private sector banks -
listed or unlisted - will be free to issue bonus and rights issues without prior approval of
the Reserve Bank. Moreover, the bonus issue will now be delinked from the rights issue.
For initial public offerings and preferential shares, however, the Reserve Bank's approval
will be necessary.
Banks will also be free to price their subsequent issues once their shares are listed
on the stock exchanges.  While detailing the pricing norms, the Reserve Bank has stated
that the issue price should be based on merchant banker's recommendation. Pricing of
preferential issues by listed banks may be as per SEBI formula, while for unlisted banks
the fair value may be determined by a chartered accountant or a merchant banker. In case
of pricing of issues where RBI approval is not required, pricing should be as per SEBI
guidelines; in cases where prior approval of the Reserve Bank is required, pricing should
take into account both SEBI and RBI guidelines.
The Reserve Bank has further clarified that banks will have to meet SEBI's
requirements on issue of bonus shares.
The current regulations require banks in the private sector whose shares are not
listed on the stock exchange to obtain prior approval of the Reserve Bank for issue of all
types of shares viz., public, preferential, rights/special allotment to employees and bonus.
Banks whose shares are listed on the stock exchanges need not seek prior approval of the
Reserve Bank for issue of shares except bonus shares which is to be linked with
rights/public issues by all the banks in the private sector.
