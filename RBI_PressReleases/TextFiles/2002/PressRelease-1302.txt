accounts for the current financial year (2001-2002) arrangements have been
made to receive Government taxes at Reserve Bank of India, Mumbai.
Accordingly, the Reserve Bank counters will be kept open for payment of taxes
on Saturday, March 30, 2002 and Sunday, March 31, 2002 as per the normal
banking hours available on any other weekday - that is, from 10.30 am to 2.30
pm for cash transactions and upto 4.15 pm for non-cash transactions.
Tax payers are advised to take advantage of the arrangements made for their
convenience. However, to avoid heavy rush on the last day, tax payers are
advised to deposit their tax dues well in advance.
