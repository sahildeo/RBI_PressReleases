RBI simplifies Procedure for Exhibition
and Sale of Goods outside India
March 25, 2002
The Reserve Bank of India has decided to simplify the procedure for taking goods for
exhibition and sale outside India.
Under the simplified procedure, authorised dealers can approve the export of goods for
exhibition outside India and any prior permission from the Reserve Bank will not be
required.  Further, exporters will have the freedom to sell the unsold exhibits at a price to
be determined by them, including discounts, in the same country or a third country.
Alternatively, unsold goods can be brought back to India.  Exporters will also have
freedom to gift unsold small value items upto US dollar 5000 per exhibition.
Proceeds of goods sold at the exhibition as well as outside would, however, require to be
repatriated to India through banking channels.
