Indian Exporters allowed to receive Part Export
Value in Shares in Start-up Companies
May 30, 2002
It has been decided to permit Indian software exporters to receive equity upto 25
per cent of the value of their exports to overseas start-up companies that have initial
liquidity constraints. Software exporters desirous of availing of this facility may approach
the Reserve Bank of India through their authorised dealer for necessary permission. The
decision has been taken with a view to strengthening the competitive advantage of Indian
software exporters.
The Reserve Bank of India had been receiving representations from Indian
software exporters to permit them, at their option, to receive a certain percentage of the
value of their exports in the form of shares in overseas start-up companies that have
initial liquidity constraints. Such equity acquisitions would be without entering into a
joint venture agreement with the overseas entity, and are likely to help Indian exporters in
getting long-term export orders.
