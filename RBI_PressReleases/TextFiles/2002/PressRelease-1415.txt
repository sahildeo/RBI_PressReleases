Interest on Relief Bonds - Clarification 
 
 It has been reported in some sections of the Press that "the interest rate 
will be lowered even on past schemes of Relief Bonds". This can be misleading. 
 
 It is clarified that interest rates under all relief bonds schemes will continue 
to be at the contracted rate up to the date of maturity. Thus for example, the 
bonds issued under 9 per cent relief bonds, 1999 and 8.5 per cent relief bonds, 
2001 schemes will carry interest at the contracted rate of 9 per cent and 8.5 per 
cent respectively till their date of maturity. 
 
 As a facility to the investor, however, interest on relief bonds is paid even 
after the bonds mature till they are encashed. Interest in such cases is paid at the 
contracted rate till the bonds mature and at the applicable revised rates for the 
period between the date of maturity and the date of encashment.
