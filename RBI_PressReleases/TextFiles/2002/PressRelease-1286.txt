April 1, 2002
The revised Ways and Means Advances Scheme, 2002 will come into effect from
April 1, 2002. The total revised normal WMA limits works out to Rs.6,035 crore as
against the present limits of Rs.5,283 crore representing an increase of Rs.752 crore or
about 14 per cent.
The main features of the Scheme are:
Normal WMA Limits
The normal WMA limits are revised taking into account the three years’ average
of revenue receipts and capital expenditure for fiscal years 1998-99, 1999-2000 and
2000-01 and to this base a ratio of 2.4 per cent is applied for the non-special category
States and 2.9 per cent for the special category States, with a minimum normal WMA
limit of Rs.50 crore for any state.  Accordingly, the total revised normal WMA limits
works out to Rs.6,035 crore as against the present limits of Rs.5,283 crore representing an
increase of Rs.752 crore or about 14 per cent.
Special WMA and Minimum Balance
The present Scheme of special WMA and Minimum Balance will continue. The
special WMA continues to be linked to the investments made by State Governments in
the Government of India Securities, i.e., Dated Securities and Treasury Bills.
Overdraft Regulation Scheme
The Overdraft Regulation Scheme is:
a) The RBI will allow a State to run an overdraft for 12 consecutive working days as at
present.  In case the overdraft appears in the State’s account and remains beyond 12
consecutive working days, the RBI and its agencies will stop payments on behalf of
the concerned State Governments.
b) The overdraft will not exceed 100 per cent of normal WMA limit.  On the first
occasion that this is exceeded in a financial year, the RBI will advise the State that the
overdraft amount should not exceed 100 per cent of normal WMA limit on any
subsequent occasion.
c) If during the financial year, the amount of overdraft exceeds 100 per cent of WMA
limit on a second or any subsequent occasion, the State will be given five working
days’ notice, as is being done at present, to bring down the overdraft amount within
the level of 100 per cent of normal WMA limit.  If this is not adhered to, payments
will be stopped.Effective date
The revised limits would come into force from April 1, 2002.
Review
The WMA Scheme 2002 is subject to review in its entirety next year.
Background
The Ways and Means Advances (WMA) Scheme, 2001, of the State Governments
has been in effect from February 1, 2001. The details of the WMA Scheme, 2001 were
worked out on the basis of the recommendations of the Informal Group of the State

receipts and capital expenditure for the latest three years and review this arrangement in
2003.
