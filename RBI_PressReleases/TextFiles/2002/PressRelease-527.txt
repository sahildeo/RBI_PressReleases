EEFC Account Scheme for EOUs further  liberalised
September 6, 2002
As a part of continuous process of rationalisation and simplification of procedures
and further liberalisation of the existing regulations relating to exporters, the Reserve
Bank of India has announced rationalisation of the Exchange Earners’ Foreign Currency
(EEFC) Account Scheme.
As a further measure towards giving boost to the export oriented units and
rationalisation of the EEFC Account Scheme, there will now be only two categories of
EEFC account holders. One, those who can retain upto 100% of their receipt in foreign
exchange and others who can retain upto 50% of their receipt in foreign exchange.
Accordingly, a 100% Export Oriented Unit (EOU) or a unit situated in (a) Export
Processing Zone ( EPZ) or (b) Software Technology Park ( STP) or (c) Electronic
Hardware Technology Park (EHTP), will now, be eligible to credit upto 100% of their
foreign exchange receipts to their EEFC Account, against the existing eligibility of credit
upto 70%. So far, the facility of crediting upto 100% of receipts was available only to
Status Holder Exporters and Professionals who rendered services in their individual
capacity, to entities outside India . As a result of this liberalisation, the facility of
crediting upto 100% of foreign exchange receipts to their EEFC account will now also be
available to Status Holder Exporters, Professionals, 100% EOUs and units in
EPZ/STP/EHTP.
Pending issue of the notification amending the existing Regulations framed under
Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 (FEMA), the Regional Offices of the Reserve
Bank will expeditiously deal with applications received with regard to the change.
