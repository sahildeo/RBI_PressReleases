RBI liberalises Money Changing Facilities
January 12, 2002
Resident entities wishing to undertake restricted money changing would no longer
be required to obtain licence from the Reserve Bank of India.  Under the new scheme
announced by the Reserve Bank Authorised Dealers (ADs) and Full Fledged Money
Changers (FFMCs) have been accorded the freedom to enter into agency/franchising
agreements for the purposes of carrying on the business of conversion of foreign currency
notes, coins or travellers cheques into rupees.  ADs and FFMCs desirous of entering into
such business arrangements would only be required to obtain a one-time approval from
the Reserve Bank.  Details of the new scheme are available on the FEMA RBI Website
www.rbi.org.in. The names and locations of the existing Restricted Money Changers will
be made available on the RBI website. Names and addresses of those who would
henceforth operate under the new scheme would also be made available on the RBI
website.
