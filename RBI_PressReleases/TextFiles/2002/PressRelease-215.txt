Procedural Simplification and Liberalisation for Advance Remittance for Imports
November 15, 2002
Under the existing Exchange Control regulations, importers are permitted to remit
advance for import upto USD 25,000 and where the amount of advance being remitted
exceeds USD 25,000, the remittance is required to be made against a guarantee from a bank
of international repute situated outside India.
In keeping with its policy of liberalisation and with an objective of simplifying and
liberalising the procedure for import, permitted under Import-Export Policy, the Reserve Bank
has decided that importers will now be able to make advance remittance upto USD 1,00,000
(One hundred thousand only) without any prior approval from the Reserve Bank.
In case importers fail to import the goods within the prescribed time period from the
date of advance remittance, the importer would be required to repatriate the amount remitted
immediately.
