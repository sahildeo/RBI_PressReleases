Reliance on Call/Notice Money Market : Prudential Norm
As announced in the Annual Monetary and Credit Policy Statement for 2002-2003,
and after further consultations with bankers, prudential limits on the exposure of commercial
banks in call/notice money market have been stipulated in two stages. The corresponding
circular to all scheduled commercial banks has been issued and is available on the RBI
website (www.rbi.org.in).
The limits prescribed are prudential in nature and are sufficiently high for the
participants in the market and it is expected that all liquidity needs of banks would be met.
Further, it is proposed to review the money market developments in a meeting with the banks
in the second half of November 2002.
