Acceptance of Income Tax and other Direct Taxes
November 11, 2002
For the convenience of Income Tax Assessees, arrangements have been made for
receipt of Advance Income Tax at about 820 computerised branches of all the Public Sector
Banks and HDFC Bank in Mumbai and Navi Mumbai. The designated branches are
authorized by the Income Tax Department to accept payment of Income Tax dues. Assessees
are advised to take advantage of these standing arrangements made for their convenience.
Long queues and inconveniences can be avoided at the Reserve Bank counters if the assesses
in Mumbai and Navi Mumbai utilize the services being made available at various branches of
Public Sector Banks and deposit their Income Tax dues well in advance of the last date.
