need not submit deposit returns to RBI
July 11, 2002
The Reserve Bank of India has reiterated that non-banking non-financial
companies need not submit to it the return of deposits.  In terms of the provisions
contained in the Companies Act, 1956, the non-banking non-financial companies are
required to submit the return on deposits mobilised by them to the Registrar of
Companies.  Copies of these returns were also being received in the Reserve Bank for
statistical purpose.  It had however, discontinued the system of receiving copies of return
on deposits from the non-banking non-financial companies from March 31, 1999
onwards.  The Reserve Bank has, however, clarified that there is no change in
instructions in relation to non-banking financial companies.
