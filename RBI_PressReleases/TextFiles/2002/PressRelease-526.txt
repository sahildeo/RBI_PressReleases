Liberalisation of Loans from Close Relatives outside India
September 6, 2002
           The Reserve Bank of India has been taking steps towards procedural
simplifications and liberalisation of the existing rules and regulations relating to the
foreign exchange transactions by residents in India.
Under the existing Regulations, residents have general permission to borrow upto
US$250,000 from their close relatives resident outside India provided the loan is free of
interest and is not repayable before seven years.  In view of the representations received
by the Reserve Bank,  it has been decided to reduce the minimum period for repayment
for such loans to one year. Accordingly, residents will now be able to borrow upto
US$250,000 from their close relatives resident outside India provided the loan is free of
interest and is repayable after one year.
Pending issue of the notification amending the existing Rules/Regulations framed
under Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 (FEMA), the Regional Offices of the
Reserve Bank will expeditiously deal with applications received in this regard.
