Lock-in Period for Repatriation of Sale Proceeds of
Immovable Properties for NRIs/PIOs removed
March 22, 2002
With a view to providing greater facilities to non-resident Indians (NRIs)/persons
of Indian origin (PIOs), the Reserve Bank of India has removed the lock-in period for
repatriation of sale proceeds of immovable property purchased in India by them through
inward remittances. The sale proceeds allowed to be repatriated should, however, not
exceed the foreign exchange brought in to acquire the property. This liberalised facility of
remittance will also be available to NRIs/PIOs who have already made payment for
acquiring immovable property in India.
Currently NRIs/PIOs are permitted to repatriate sale proceeds of immovable
property only after a lock-in period of three years from the date of acquisition or payment
of final instalment for the purchase, whichever is later. The repatriation of sale proceeds
is limited to the foreign exchange brought in to purchase the property.
A notification for carrying out suitable amendments in the regulations is being
issued and on its publication in the Official Gazette, it would be possible for NRIs/PIOs
to effect such remittances without the prior approval of the Reserve Bank.
Until further notice, the applications for such remittances may be made to the
Regional Offices of the Reserve Bank.
