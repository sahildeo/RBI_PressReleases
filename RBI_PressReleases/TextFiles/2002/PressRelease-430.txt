Balance Sheet of Centurion Bank Ltd.
September 28, 2002
In response to the enquiries made by the press, following the announcement of the
financial results for the year ended 2001-2002 by Centurion Bank Ltd., the Reserve Bank
of India has stated that Shri V. Janakiraman, the present Chairman and Managing
Director of the bank has been discussing the matters regarding the financial position of
the bank with the Reserve Bank. The Reserve Bank welcomes the decision taken by
Centurion Bank Ltd. and its Board of Directors to clean up the balance sheet. The
Reserve Bank has noted that even though the cleaned up balance sheet shows an overall
loss, the bank has made operating profit for the year ended 2001-2002.
The cleaning up of the balance sheet is essential for sound functioning of the
bank, good health of the financial system as well as to comply with the requirements of
full disclosure to the public. The Reserve Bank has, therefore, been requesting banking
institutions to fully meet all the provisioning requirements including any past arrears
arising out of its loan portfolio.
