RBI Governor's Comments on Budget
March 1, 2002
Responding to media queries this morning, the RBI Governor Dr. Bimal Jalan gave the
following reaction to the Union Budget for 2002-2003 :
"This is an extremely well crafted Budget. It is reformist and forward looking. It builds
on far reaching tax reform measures introduced by India in respect of direct and indirect
taxes, which are on par with international best practices. The Budget has also given a
strong thrust to the development of financial markets. The measures for enhancing
investments, particularly in infrastructure and agriculture, will definitely boost
investments and growth. My personal reaction is very very positive. I am sure this feeling
will be shared by all economy watchers - sooner rather than later".
