1997. In terms of this notification, the value of principal repayment was to be adjusted for
the index ratio as worked out below:
Reference WPI
Index Ratio=
Base WPI
Where, Reference WPI is the monthly (average) Wholesale Price Index for All
Commodities (1981-82=100) pertaining to the month of August, 2002 and
Base WPI is monthly (average) Wholesale Price Index for All Commodities
(1981-82=100) pertaining to the month of August 1997.
 Meanwhile, the Government of India has replaced the old series (Base: 1981-
82=100) with a new series (Base: 1993-94=100) for the Wholesale Price Index with
effect from the week ending April 1, 2000. For the purpose of deriving the reference WPI
of the bonds, the Government of India vide Press Communiqué dated December 2, 2002
announced a linking factor of 2.478 for conversion of indices from the base 1993-94
series to the earlier base 1981-82.
 After taking into account this linking factor, the reference WPI for the month of
August 2002 comes to 414.07. The Base WPI for the month of August 1997 being
326.00,  the index ratio as rounded off to two decimal places works out to 1.27.  As per
this index ratio, the repayment amount per Rs. 100 of nominal value of the bonds will be
Rs. 127.
