RBI to relax timeframe for investments in Government
securities and other approved securities by
urban banks on a case-by-case basis
March 21, 2002
The Reserve Bank of India has decided to consider, on a case to case basis, extension of
timeframe for investment in Government and other approved securities by urban
cooperative banks as part of SLR investments.  The relaxation has been made in order to
smoothen the process of compliance in respect of banks that may have difficulties in
complying with RBI norms on SLR investments.
The Reserve Bank has further advised urban cooperative banks requiring extension to
send before April 15, 2002, a letter seeking extension in timeframe. The letter should
explain the current status, difficulties in compliance and a time-table for compliance with
indicative milestones. Scheduled urban cooperative banks should send the letter to the
Chief General Manager-in-Charge, Reserve Bank of India, Central Office, Urban Banks
Department, Mumbai; non-scheduled urban cooperative banks may approach the
Regional Director under whose jurisdiction they function for the purpose; and non-
scheduled urban cooperative banks functioning under the jurisdiction of Mumbai
Regional Office of Urban Banks Department should approach the Chief General
Manager/General Manager-in-Charge of Mumbai Regional Office of the Urban Banks
Department for necessary extension of time.
It may be recalled that the Reserve Bank of India had, in October 2001 advised urban
cooperative banks to invest in Government and other approved securities upto a certain
percentage by September 30, 2002. Further, with effect from April 1, 2003, all scheduled
urban cooperative banks are expected to maintain their entire SLR assets of 25 per cent of
net demand and time liabilities only in Government and other approved securities. While
most banks have either achieved or are in a position to achieve the stipulated target
within the time-frame, some banks had expressed that they might face difficulties in
complying with the stipulated time-frame and had sought extension of time for
compliance.
