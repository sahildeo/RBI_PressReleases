RBI to review Growth Rate for 2002-2003 in October
August 30, 2002
A re-assessment of the projected growth rate for the current year will be attempted in the
mid-term review of the Monetary and Credit Policy in October 2002.  This was confirmed by the
RBI spokesperson on a query from some newspersons. Paragraph 7.11 of the Assessment and
Prospects chapter in the Annual Report of the Reserve Bank of India, released today, which deals
with the growth prospects for the current year, reads as follows:
" On the whole, the macroeconomic prospects for the current year 2002-03 are mixed. On
the one hand, financial, liquidity and inflationary conditions are highly favourable for higher
growth. Similarly, the external sector is also strong with a high and growing level of foreign
exchange reserves and competitive exchange rate. On the other hand, the agricultural outlook is
sombre with the likelihood of widespread drought. This may also adversely affect the incipient
industrial recovery unless countervailing and timely measures are put in place to accelerate the
pace of industrial investment and economic reforms. On balance, there is a strong possibility that
the growth rate of 6.0 to 6.5 per cent projected in the Annual Monetary and Credit Policy
Statement (April 2002), which was based on the assumption of a normal monsoon, will not be
realised. On the basis of current indications about the monsoon, the growth rate is likely to be
lower than projected earlier. A re-assessment of the projected growth rate for the current year
will be attempted in the mid-term review of the Monetary and Credit Policy in October 2002, by
which time reliable information regarding the effects of drought on the agricultural and industrial
output will be available ".
