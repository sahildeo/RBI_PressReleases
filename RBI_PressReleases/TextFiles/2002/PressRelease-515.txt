No Documentation for Small Value Remittance
September 9, 2002
For the convenience of resident individuals and pursuant to its commitment to
simplification of procedures, the Reserve Bank of India has reviewed the existing application
form and documentation for release of foreign exchange for various purposes.
With a view to providing hassle free release of foreign exchange, the Reserve Bank
has advised banks dealing in foreign exchange in India that foreign exchange, upto USD500,
should be released on the basis of a simple letter from resident individuals as long as it
contains basic information, namely, name and address of the applicant, name and address of
the beneficiary, amount to be remitted and the purpose of remittance.
The Reserve Bank has further clarified that no documents are required, as long as, the
amount of remittance does not exceed USD500 and the payment is being made by a cheque
drawn on the applicant's bank account or by a demand draft.
