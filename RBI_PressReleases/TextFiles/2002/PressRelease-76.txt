December 14, 2002
It was reported in a section of the press today that the Reserve Bank of India has
allowed banks to sanction loans against Relief  Bonds.
The Reserve Bank of India has clarified that as per Government of India
instructions, banks are allowed to sanction loans against Relief Bonds only. This facility
is not available against 7 per cent  Savings Bonds, 2002, which is a new scheme
introduced in October 2002.
The 7 per cent Savings  Bonds  2002,  which  were introduced  from October 1
this year, are not eligible as collateral for loans from banks, financial institutions and non-
banking financial institutions. Unlike 8 per cent Relief Bonds, 2002 there is no upper
limit for investments in 7 per cent Savings Bonds. Income tax and wealth tax exemptions
are, however, available to interest earned on both the Bonds.
