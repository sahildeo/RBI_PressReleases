RBI relaxes Procedure for Export Realisation
January 28, 2002
With a view to further liberalising the procedure for export realisation, it has been
decided that authorised dealers may, for sufficient and reasonable causes shown, extend
the period of realisation beyond six months from the date of export in respect of invoice
value not exceeding US $ 1,00,000.  The extension will be subject to the following
conditions:
(i) The exporter should submit a declaration that he will realise the export proceeds
during the extended period.
(ii) The extension may be granted upto three months at a time, and while considering
the extension beyond one year from the date of export the total export
outstandings should not be more than 10 per cent of the average of export
realisations during the preceding three financial years.
The ceiling of US $ 1,00,000 would, however, not apply where the exporter has
filed suit against the importer abroad.   In such cases, extension may be granted upto six
months at a time, irrespective of the amount involved.
Cases which are not covered by these instructions would require prior approval
from the Regional Office of the Reserve Bank of India. Cases where (i) the export
invoices are under investigation by Enforcement Directorate/Central Bureau of
Investigation or other investigating agencies; (ii) where invoice value exceeds US $
1,00,000 (except in cases where the exporter has filed a suit against the importer abroad)
would also require prior approval from the Regional Office of the Reserve Bank.
At present, exporters who have not realised and repatriated the proceeds of
exports within six months from the date of export have to obtain approval of the Reserve
Bank for extension of the period of realisation.
