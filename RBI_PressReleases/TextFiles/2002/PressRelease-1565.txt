Liberalisation in Export Procedures-
Delegation to Authorised Dealers: Clarification
January 31, 2002
In some of the press reports, it has been stated that the Reserve Bank of India has
eased export realisation norms for bills upto US$ one lakh and exporters are eligible to retain
export proceeds abroad beyond 180 days.
The Reserve Bank of India has clarified that there is no change in the norms
prescribed for the period of realisation of export bills.  However, authorised dealers have now
been delegated authority to grant extension of time for realising export bills in certain cases
where extension is necessitated which was so far, being granted only by the Reserve Bank.
