Procedure and Documentation Simplified
for Release of Foreign Exchange
September 27, 2002
During last few months, the Reserve Bank of India has taken several steps to
simplify the procedures with a view to ensuring that resident individuals are able to
obtain foreign exchange with minimum formalities and documentation. With a view to
ensuring that authorised dealers are able to provide absolutely hassle free service to
resident individuals, the  Reserve Bank advised authorised dealers on September 12,
2002, that for release of foreign exchange upto USD 500 to resident individuals, no
document need be called for at all. Further, so long as necessary details, namely, name
and address of the applicant, name and address of the beneficiary, amount to be remitted
and purpose of remittance are indicated, the applicants are not required to even to fill up
the prescribed application form viz., Form A-2.
It is reiterated, for the benefit of  the public that for the following categories of
transactions no documents are required to be produced by bonafide applicants for
obtaining necessary foreign exchange:
(i) For tourism upto USD 5000, in one calendar year
(ii) For business travel upto USD 25,000 per trip
(iii) For studies upto USD 30,000 per academic year
(iv) For medical treatment upto USD50,000
(v) Gift/donations upto USD 5,000 in a year
 It is, however, clarified that for remittance or purchase of foreign exchange for all
these eligible purposes, the payment is required to be made by a cheque drawn on the
applicant’s bank account or by a demand draft.
Further, it is added that international credit cards, ATM cards, debit cards can be
used on internet also for any purpose for which exchange can be purchased from an
authorised dealer in India. For instances, for meeting travel expenses outside India, for
import of books, purchase of downloadable softwares or import of any other item into
India which is permissible under the current export-import policy.
The Reserve Bank has once again brought these instructions to the notice of
authorised dealers.
