Working Group on Lenders' Liability Laws
December 19, 2002
The Government of India had constituted a Working Group to study Lenders' Liability Laws
of other countries and their implications on the borrowers, lenders, regulators and other
stakeholders and to make recommendations regarding legislative proposals suitable for Indian
conditions. The Group submitted its report in October 2002.  After considering the pros and
cons of the issue, the Group has recommended that for the time being a Fair Practices Code
may be framed by the Reserve Bank of India for observance by banks and Financial
Institutions.
After discussing with select banks and Financial Institutions and getting the
recommendations of the Working Group examined by an internal group, draft guidelines on
the subject to be issued to banks and financial institutions have been formulated by the
Reserve Bank. These guidelines are being released today for public comments.  Any
comments, suggestions etc., may be forwarded to Shri M.R. Srinivasan, Chief General
Manager-in-Charge, Reserve Bank of India, Department of Banking Operations and
Development, Central Office, Centre 1, Post Box No.6089, Cuffe Parade, Colaba, Mumbai-
