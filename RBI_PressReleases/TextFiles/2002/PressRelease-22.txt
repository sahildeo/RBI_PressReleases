Relaxation in Daily Minimum
Cash Resrve Maintenance Requirement
December 26, 2002
At present, banks are required to maintain a minimum of 80 per cent of the required cash
reserve ratio (CRR) amount on a daily basis during a fortnight, which is applicable on all the
days of the reporting fortnight.
On a review based on feedback received from banks, it has been decided to reduce the
present requirement of minimum of 80 per cent to 70 per cent with effect from the fortnight
beginning December 28, 2002.
This relaxation will provide flexibility to banks in choosing an optimum strategy of holding
reserves depending upon their intra-period cash flows.
