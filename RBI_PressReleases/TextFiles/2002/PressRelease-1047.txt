Monitoring of Investment limit by NRIs/ PIOs in Indian Companies
May 21, 2002
The Reserve Bank of India has today notified that non-resident Indians (NRIs)
and persons of Indian origin (PIOs) can now purchase equity shares and convertible
debentures of Garware Shipping Corporation Ltd., through stock exchanges under
portfolio investment scheme (PIS).  The Reserve Bank has further notified that the
company's Board of Directors has passed a resolution restricting the purchase of its
equity shares and convertible debentures by NRIs and PIOs upto 17 per cent.  To
effectively monitor the ceiling limit of 17 per cent the Reserve Bank will notify, as
soon as the aggregate net purchases of equity shares/convertible debentures of the
company by NRIs reach the limit of 15 per cent of its paid up capital.
