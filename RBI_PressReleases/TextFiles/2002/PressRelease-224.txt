RBI notifies draft scheme for amalgamating Nedungadi Bank with PNB; allays
fears of depositors
November 14, 2002
The Reserve Bank of India yesterday notified the draft scheme for amalgamation of
Nedungadi Bank Limited with Punjab National Bank. The draft scheme has been
forwarded to both the banks for their comments and the Reserve Bank has invited
suggestions or objections on the draft scheme by November 30, 2002. The draft
scheme for amalgamation can be obtained from the banks by any of their members,
depositors or creditors.
It may be recalled that the Reserve Bank has placed Nedungadi bank under
moratorium up to February 1, 2003 earlier this month in the best interest of all
depositors. It also restricted the depositors of this bank from withdrawing more than
Rs. 5000 during the period of moratorium.
The proposed amalgamation envisages full protection of the public deposits. The
Reserve Bank will make all efforts to complete the due process for the proposed
merger as early as possible.
The Reserve Bank has been receiving several requests from the depositors of
Nedungadi Bank Limited to allow them to withdraw their deposits in excess of the
limit of Rs. 5000 for various personal and other reasons. Reserve Bank of India will
consider such requests on a case to case basis depending upon their genuineness.
The Chairman of Nedungadi Bank and the Regional Director for Kerala have been
issued with necessary instructions in this regard.
