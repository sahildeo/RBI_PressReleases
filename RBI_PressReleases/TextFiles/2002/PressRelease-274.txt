RBI notifies Repayment of Packing Credit
November 1, 2002
The Reserve Bank of India today issued instructions to commercial banks stating that the
exporters may be allowed to repay/pre-pay packing credit (including for deemed exports),
whether availed of in rupees or in foreign currency, out of the balances in Exchange Earners'
Foreign Currency account (EEFC), as also, from rupee resources of the exporter to the extent
exporters have taken place.   The Reserve Bank has asked banks to ensure that the goods have
been shipped by the exporter complying with relevant exchange control regulations before
extinguishing the outstanding packing credit in this manner, specifically with regard to
realisation of export proceeds in accordance with relevant exchange control regulations.
Further, in order to provide some more flexibility to the exporters, banks may, at their
discretion, allow exporters to convert their drawals under rupee pre-shipment credit into Pre-
shipment Credit in Foreign Currency (PCFC).
It may be recalled that the Reserve Bank had, on October 29, 2002, announced in the mid-
term Review of Monetary and Credit Policy for the year 2002-03 that subject to mutual
agreement between the exporter and the bank, the repayment/pre-payment of pre-shipment
credit would be permitted. For this purpose, balances held in the EEFC account of the
exporter can also be used. The Policy had stated that while utilising this facility, the exporters
would be required to adhere to the current regulations in regard to repatriation of export
proceeds within the stipulated period. This facility would be available until further notice.
