RBI launches Technical Assistance Programme
 for strengthening MIS in Co-operative Banks
August 9, 2002
The Reserve Bank of India has set in motion a Technical Assistance Programme for
strengthening the Management Information System (MIS) in co-operative banks.
The programme would focus on strengthening the MIS systems in co-operative banks by
studying their needs and systems on-site and proposing appropriate solutions and monitoring
their implementation. Initially, the training cum technical assistance would be restricted to the
scheduled urban co-operative banks. Participation by co-operative banks in the programme will
be on a voluntary basis.
The programme, which is being put into operation at the directions of the Board for
Financial Supervision of the Reserve Bank of India, will be implemented in association with
National Institute of Bank Management, Pune, College of Agricultural Banking, Pune and
outside experts. The Reserve Bank will largely fund the programme, with the beneficiary
institutions making a nominal contribution.
