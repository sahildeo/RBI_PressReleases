All RBI regulated Entities to hold
G-Secs in Demat Form
May 20, 2002
The Reserve Bank of India, has been, over a period of time, encouraging holding of
government securities in dematerialised form. At present 99% of the trading in government
securities takes place through SGL accounts with RBI for which the Delivery versus
Payment (DVP) system ensures simultaneous transfer of securities against funds.
In the light of recent fraudulent transactions in the guise of Government securities
transactions in physical format by a few co-operative banks with the help of some broker
entities, it has been decided inter alia that :
1. No further transactions by a RBI regulated entity should be undertaken in physical
form with any broker entity with immediate effect.
2.  All entities regulated by RBI [including financial institutions (FIs), primary
dealers (PDs), cooperative banks, RRBs, local area banks (LABs), non banking financial
companies (NBFCs)] should necessarily hold their investments in Government securities
portfolio in either SGL (with RBI) or CSGL [with a scheduled commercial bank/State
Cooperative Bank/PD/FI/sponsor bank (in case of RRBs)] and SHCIL  or in a
dematerialised account  with depositories (NSDL/CDSL).
A copy of the circular issued to banks and other regulated entities is enclosed .
