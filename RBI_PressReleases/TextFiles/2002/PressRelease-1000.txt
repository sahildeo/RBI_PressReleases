Negotiated Dealing System (NDS) - Cut-off date
May 31, 2002
Currently all major participants are live NDS members submitting electronic SGL
transfer form for settlement of their transactions in government securities. All SGL
account holders were given time only up to May 31, 2002 to become NDS members.  In
the light of the representations received by the Reserve Bank of India from some market
participants indicating difficulties in adhering to the time-schedule such as delays in
obtaining required hardware and system software, to put the NDS system in place by
May 31, 2002, it has been decided to continue to allow each of such participants to
submit physical SGL transfer form till the date specifically agreed in respect of each of
them as the last date for such submission.
