RBI announces further relaxations in Exchange Control
Forward cover for Foreign Institutional Investors (FII)
At present, a registered FII is permitted to enter into a forward contract with the Rupee as one of
the currencies, with an authorised dealer in India to hedge its exposure upto 15 percent of the
market value of the equity (as at the close of business as on 31 March 1999) plus the increase in
market value/inflows thereafter.  As a measure of further liberalisation and simplification of
procedure, it has been decided to permit  FIIs to hedge their entire exposure in India in equities
as at a particular point of time without any reference to the cut off date.  The condition that the
forward contracts once cancelled shall not be rebooked will however continue.
Investment in Overseas markets
In April 2002, Authorised Dealers were permitted to invest upto 25 percent  of their unimpaired
Tier 1 capital or US $10 million, whichever was higher, in overseas money market instruments
and/ or debt instruments.  To accord banks greater freedom in their funds management, it has
been decided to enhance this eligibility to 50 percent  of the unimpaired Tier 1 capital or US $ 25
million, whichever is higher.  All other conditions would remain unchanged.
