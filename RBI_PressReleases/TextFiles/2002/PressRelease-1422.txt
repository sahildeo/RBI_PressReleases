NBFCs to frame Policy for Demand/Call Loans
March 4, 2002
The Reserve Bank of India today announced that all non-banking finance
companies (NBFCs) granting/intending to grant demand/call loans should lay down a
policy duly approved by their board of directors. The policy should cover the following
aspects :
(i) Stipulation of a cut off date within which the repayment of the loan will be
demanded/called up. If the cut off date is beyond one year, the sanctioning
authority should record specific reasons.
(ii) Stipulation of the rate of interest and the periodic rests for payment of interest,
which should be at quarterly/monthly intervals. Where no interest is levied or
a moratorium is granted, the sanctioning authority should record specific
reasons.
(iii) Stipulation of a cut off date not exceeding six months for review of the
performance of the loan.
(iv) Such loans should be renewed on the basis of a review covering satisfactory
compliance with the terms of sanction.
The Reserve Bank also clarified that all such loans remaining unpaid for more
than six months from the date of demand/call or loans where interest remained past due
for a period of six months from the due date would be classified as non-performing
assets. The provisioning requirements as applicable to loans, advances and other credit
facility would be applicable to such loans.
Background
As certain NBFCs were granting demand/call loans with an open period or
without any stipulation regarding the rate of interest and servicing, difficulty was being
experienced in ensuring compliance with prudential norms on income recognition, asset
classification and provisioning in respect of such loans. In order to obviate this difficulty
and to ensure that all such loans are appropriately classified and the position of non-
performing assets is truly reflected in the financial statements of NBFCs, the directions
have been issued.
