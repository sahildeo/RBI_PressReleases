Prudential Norms
July 31, 2002
The Reserve Bank of India has stipulated prudential limit on lending by primary
dealers (PDs) in call/notice money market with effect from October 5, 2002. It has also
asked them to gradually reduce their borrowings in call/notice money market in two
stages. The dates of effecting both the stages would be notified later depending upon
further developments in the repo market.  The Reserve Bank has clarified that the limits
prescribed are prudential in nature and are sufficiently high for participants in the market.
Further, it has stated that the money market developments would be reviewed in a
meeting with the PDs in the second half of November 2002.
The prudential limit has been prescribed as announced in the annual Monetary
and Credit Policy Statement for 2002-2003 on April 29, 2002, and following the
recommendations of a Working Group (comprising officials from market participants and
the Reserve Bank under the Chairmanship of Shri Mohammad Tahir, Executive Director,
RBI) constituted to suggest the criteria for fixing limits for transactions of PDs in
call/notice money market as also to suggest a roadmap for phasing them out from
call/notice money market.
The detailed circular issued to all primary dealers (PDs) is available on the RBI
website (www.rbi.org.in).
