Minimum Lending Rate of Co-operative Banks
reduced to 12%
March 7, 2002
The Reserve Bank of India has decided to reduce the minimum lending rate of urban co-
operative banks (UCBs) by one per cent - from 13 per cent to 12 per cent.  The reduced
rate has come into effect from March 2, 2002.  Urban cooperative banks may, therefore,
determine their lending rates subject to a minimum lending rate of 12 per cent per annum.
The decision was taken in the wake of representations received from urban co-operative
banks and their federations which had felt that such a reduction would help them offer
competitive rates to their borrowers. It was decided to reduce the minimum lending rate
of co-operative banks to 12 per cent per annum after examining the representations.
