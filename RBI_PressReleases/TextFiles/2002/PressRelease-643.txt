The Reserve Bank of India has cancelled the licence of The Kalwa Belapur
Sahakari Bank Ltd., Navi Mumbai, Maharashtra to carry on banking business.  The bank
is precluded from transacting the business of ‘banking’ as defined in the Banking
Regulation Act, 1949 (as applicable to Co-operative Societies). Thus, it will not be in
order for it, among other things, to accept deposits from the public and allow withdrawals
by cheque, draft, order or otherwise.
