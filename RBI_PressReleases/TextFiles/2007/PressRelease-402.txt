RBI Announces Further Measures for Monetary and Liquidity Management 
In its Mid-Term Review of the Annual Policy Statement for 2008-09, the Reserve Bank of India 
indicated that in the context of the uncertain and unsettled global situation and its indirect impact on our 
domestic economy and our financial markets, it would closely and continuously monitor the situation and 
respond swiftly and effectively to developments. In doing so, the Reserve Bank will employ both conventional 
and unconventional measures. Global financial conditions continue to remain uncertain and unsettled, and early 
signs of a global recession are becoming evident. These developments are being reflected in sharp declines in 
stock markets across the world and heightened volatility in currency movements. International money markets 
are yet to regain calm and confidence and return to normal functioning.  
It was also indicated in the Mid-Term Review that the current challenge for the conduct of monetary 
policy is to strike an optimal balance between preserving financial stability, maintaining price stability and 
sustaining the growth momentum. Inflation, in terms of the wholesale price index (WPI), has been softening 
steadily since August 9, 2008 and has declined to 10.68 per cent for the week ended October 18, 2008. 
Globally, pressures from commodity prices, including crude, appear to be abating. The moderation in key global 
commodity prices, if sustained, would further reduce inflationary pressures.  On the growth front, it is important 
to ensure that credit requirements for productive purposes are adequately met so as to support the growth 
momentum of the economy. Domestic financial markets have been functioning normally. Prudent regulatory 
surveillance and effective supervision have ensured that our financial sector has been and continues to be 
robust. However, the global financial turmoil has had knock-on effects on our financial markets; this has 
reinforced the importance of focusing on preserving financial stability, 
The Reserve Bank has reviewed the current and evolving macroeconomic situation and liquidity 
conditions in the global and domestic financial markets. Based on this review, it has decided to take the 
following further measures: 
(i) On October 20, 2008, the Reserve Bank announced a reduction in the repo rate under the Liquidity 
Adjustment Facility (LAF) by 100 basis  points from 9.0 to 8.0 per cent. In view of the ebbing of upside inflation 
risks as also to address concerns relating to the moderation in the growth momentum, it has been decided to 
reduce the repo rate under the LAF by 50 basis points to 7.5 per cent with effect from November 3, 2008.  
 (ii) The cash reserve ratio (CRR) of scheduled banks is reduced by 100 basis points from 6.5 per cent to 5.5 per 
cent of net demand and time liabilities (NDTL). This will be effected in two stages: by 50 basis points 
retrospectively with effect from the fortnight beginning October 25, and by a further 50 basis points 
prospectively with effect from the fortnight beginning November 8, 2008. This measure is expected to release 
around Rs.40,000 crore into the system. 
 
 (iii) On September 16, 2008, the Reserve Bank had announced, as a   temporary and ad hoc measure, that 
scheduled banks could avail additional liquidity support under the LAF to the extent of up to one per cent of their 
NDTL and seek waiver of penal interest. It has now been decided to make this reduction permanent.  
Accordingly, the Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) will stand reduced to 24 per cent of NDTL with effect from the 
fortnight beginning November 8, 2008.   
(iv) In order to provide further comfort on liquidity and to impart flexibility in liquidity management to banks, it 
has been decided to introduce a special refinance facility under Section 17(3B) of the Reserve bank of India 
Act, 1934.  Under this facility, all scheduled commercial banks (excluding RRBs) will be provided refinance from 
the Reserve Bank equivalent to up to 1.0 per cent of each bank's NDTL as on October 24, 2008 at the LAF repo 
rate up to a maximum period of 90 days. During this period, refinance can be flexibly drawn and repaid.   
 
(v) On October 15, 2008  the Reserve Bank announced, purely as a temporary measure, that banks may avail 
of additional liquidity support exclusively for the purpose of meeting the liquidity requirements of mutual funds 
(MFs) to the extent of up to 0.5 per cent of their NDTL. A similar facility of liquidity support for non-banking 
financial companies (NBFCs) is also found to be necessary to enable them to manage their funding 
requirements.  Accordingly, it has now been decided, on a purely temporary and ad hoc basis, subject to 
review, to extend this facility and allow banks to avail liquidity support under the LAF through relaxation in the 
maintenance of SLR to the extent of up to 1.5 per cent of their NDTL. This relaxation in SLR is to be used 
exclusively for the purpose of meeting the funding requirements of NBFCs and MFs.  Banks can apportion the 
total accommodation allowed above between MFs and NBFCs flexibly as per their business needs.    
 
(vi) As indicated in the Reserve Bank's press release of September 16, 2008, as on some previous occasions, 
the Reserve Bank will continue to sell foreign exchange (US dollar) through agent banks to augment supply in 
the domestic foreign exchange market or intervene directly to meet any demand-supply gaps. The Reserve 
Bank would either sell the foreign exchange directly or advise the bank concerned to buy it in the market. All the 
transactions by the Reserve Bank will be at the prevailing market rates and as per market practice. Entities with 
bulk forex requirements can approach the Reserve Bank through their banks for this purpose.  
 
(vii) It has been decided, as a temporary measure, to permit Systemically Important Non-Deposit taking Non-
Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs-ND-SI) to raise short- term foreign currency borrowings under the 
approval route, subject to their complying with the prudential norms on capital adequacy and exposure norms. 
Details in this regard have been notified separately and are available on the Reserve Bank's web site.   
 (viii) Under the Market Stabilisation Scheme (MSS), Government Securities (treasury bills and dated securities) 
have been issued to sterilise the expansionary effects of forex inflows. In the context of forex outflows in the 
recent period, it has been decided to conduct buy-back of MSS dated securities so as to provide another 
avenue for injecting liquidity of a more durable nature into the system. This will be calibrated with the market 
borrowing programme of the Government of India. The securities proposed to be bought back and the timing 
and modalities of these operations are being notified separately.  
The Reserve Bank will continue to closely monitor the developments in the global and domestic financial 
markets and will take swift and effective action as appropriate.
