Use of electronic mode of payment for large value transactions 
Recognising the importance of ensuring the safety, security of the payment 
systems, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)  has put in place three modes of 
electronic payments i.e. Real time Gross Settlement (RTGS) System, National 
Electronic Fund Transfer (NEFT) System and Electronic Clearing Service (ECS). 
Payments by these modes have been steadily growing in the last few years. An 
internal Working Group set up by the Reserve Bank  to examine the various 
issues related to migration from paper-based systems to electronic systems 
recommended a phased approach of encouraging, monitoring and mandating for 
this migration. The Reserve Bank has been using the approach of encouraging 
and monitoring resulting in almost 40,000 bank branches spanning over 9773 
centres being covered by the RTGS and NEFT systems. 
 
A study conducted by the Reserve Bank revealed that during a three month 
period about 2,100 cheques each valued at Rs.1 crore and above were processed 
in the clearing houses in the four metros. It is proposed that with effect from     
April 1, 2008 all payment transactions of Rs. 1 crore and above between RBI 
regulated entities i.e. banks, primary dealers and NBFCs as well as in RBI 
regulated markets i.e. money market, Government Securities market and foreign 
exchange market may be mandated to be undertaken through electronic mode 
only. This move will not only reduce risk from moving large paper-based value 
retail payments to safer electronic modes, but will also bring greater efficiency and 
customer convenience to the payment systems. 
 
RBI has accordingly prepared an Approach paper and placed the same on 
its website today and the same is open for public comments up to March 3, 2008. 
Comments may be sent by e-mail or faxed to 022- 22659566 or letters addressed 
to the Chief General Manager (DPSS), Reserve Bank of India, Central Office, 
Mumbai-400001.

Use of Electronic Mode of Payment for large value transactions:  
Approach Paper 
 
Recognising the importance of electronic payment systems in ensuring safe, 
secure and fast payment and settlements RBI has put in place three modes of 
payments:

2. The volumes of transactions put through these systems have been 
steadily going up as can be seen from the table below:

 Recommendations of the Working Group on Electronification of Payments 
 
3. In this connection, an internal Working Group had examined various issues 
relating to migration from paper based instrument to these electronic payment 
systems. The Working Group had suggested a phased approach of encouraging, 
monitoring and mandating for the transactions to be moved from paper based 
system to electronic system. Accordingly, RBI has been in regular touch with 
banks and based on the feedback received in expanding the coverage, 
rationalization of systems and procedure and upgrading the technology 
infrastructure steps are being taken to strengthen these systems 
 
4. During last few months several rounds of discussions with banks had been 
held and symposia had been organised at several places in the country. The 
access points to provide RTGS and NEFT system is growing at the rate of about 
1500 additional branches every month and we expect the number of access 
points to increase further in the next few months for both RTGS and NEFT. 
 
5. While this process of encouraging and monitoring would be a continuing 
activity, it is suggested that we may now consider the third stage of migration 
strategy where use of electronic payment systems would be made mandatory for 
making large value payments beyond a cut-off amount (say Rs.1 crore).  
 
Study on Large Value Payments 
 
6. A study reveals that the daily average number of cheques for Rs.1 crore and 
above being used by all entities at four metropolitan centres for the three months 
(October-December 2007) is around 2100 valued at Rs.14,800 crore. Since four 
metro centres account for bulk of large value payments (as evident from the 
cheque clearing data), the likely volume of cheques Rs.1 crore and above may 
not be very large for the whole country. Therefore, this additional volume can be 
comfortably handled in the RTGS or NEFT or ECS infrastructure. 
 
7. Moving such large payments from an unsecured paper-based system to a fully 
secure electronic credit push system would have the following advantages: 
• Reducing credit and settlement risks from having large value retail payments 
being made by paper instruments 
 2• Bringing greater efficiency by moving large value retail payments to electronic 
mode 
• Increasing customer convenience 
• Reducing the transaction cost for the banks (which in turn can be passed on 
to customers) 
 
International Experience 
 
8. In many developed countries, the percentage growth of cheques as mode of 
payment has been negative for last few years. But in India, the cheque volume 
continues to grow with a positive growth rate, inspite of more than 33% growth 
rate (in 2006-2007 over 2005-2006) by volume in electronic transactions.  
 
Proposal 
 
9. In view of the above it is proposed to make large value payments of Rs.1 crore 
and above mandatory to be routed through electronic payment mechanism with 
time frame as under: 
Type of transactions Time frame 
(i) All payment transactions of Rs. 1 crore and 1st April 2008 
above between the RBI regulated entities such 
as banks, primary dealers and NBFCs 
 
(ii) All payments of Rs. 1 crore and above in RBI 1st April 2008 
regulated markets such as money market, 
Government securities market and foreign 
exchange market
