RBI to launch XBRL standards for Basel II Reporting System 
at an international seminar next week 
The Reserve Bank of India will launch the Basel II reporting system using eXtensible 
Business Reporting Language (XBRL) through the existing Online Returns Filing System (ORFS). 
The international seminar is being arranged on October 6 and 7, 2008 at College of Agricultural 
Banking, Pune. The theme of the seminar will be "Use of XBRL for Developing Economies – Central 
Banks' Perspective". Basel II Reporting System is the first reporting system based on XBRL. India is 
possibly the first among the developing countries to introduce XBRL standard in its reporting system. 
The system also makes use of latest technology tools, some of which are already built into its ORFS. 
The Reserve Bank introduced the Online Returns Filing System (ORFS) for a few returns, 
such as, Section 42(2) Form A return of the Reserve Bank of India Act, with the objective of 
eliminating the need for paper based data submission. ORFS also removes submission of multiple 
copies of the same return to various departments of the Reserve Bank of India, thus simplifying the 
data reporting process both for the banks and for the Reserve Bank of India. 
Select scheduled commercial banks are participating in implementation of the new capital 
adequacy framework as per the Reserve Bank of India guidelines. These banks include all the 
internationally active banks as well as some banks with only domestic presence. These banks would 
be required to submit data on capital structure to the Reserve Bank as per Basel II Reporting System 
on a quarterly basis. The return covers important parameters relating to the capital structure of banks. 
XBRL is an electronic format for communication of business and financial data which is 
revolutionising business reporting around the world.  The standardisation in-built in the XBRL 
documents provides significant benefits in the preparation, analysis and communication of business 
information.  This open standard offers cost savings, greater efficiency and improved accuracy and 
reliability to all those involved in supplying or using financial data.  XBRL enhances the usability and 
transparency of financial information reported under existing accounting standards, simplifies 
disclosure, and allows users to communicate financial information more readily and accurately. The 
XBRL global initiative is led by a non-profit organisation called XBRL International Inc. (XII), which has 
members from various agencies from more than 164 countries. 
On visualising multiple benefits of XBRL based reporting system, the Reserve Bank Governor 
had constituted a High Level Steering Committee on XBRL-based Data Reporting System (Chairman: 
Shri V Leeladhar, Deputy Governor). Besides regulatory and data collection departments of the 
Reserve Bank, the High Level Steering Committee had members from Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of India (ICAI), Indian Banks' Association, a few banks and representatives of the 
software industry. 
After substantial deliberations and a pilot study, the High Level Steering Committee decided 
to introduce XBRL standards for Basel II Reporting System, Section 42(2) Form A return of the RBI 
Act and financial statements. Of these, the Basel II Reporting System is being launched on October 6, 
2008. The taxonomy for Basel II Reporting System is broadly aligned with the COREP framework of 
the European Union. 
The High Level Steering Committee decided to introduce XBRL standards for all major 
returns being received from scheduled commercial banks to the Reserve Bank in phased manner. As 
a part of XBRL implementation, the Committee reduced the number of returns to be submitted from 
scheduled commercial banks to the Reserve Bank to 223 from 291. This was notified through RBI 
Press Release on August 14, 2008.  2
All related XBRL taxonomies and schemas will be put on the Reserve Bank website for the 
benefit of data users and analysts. The XBRL reporting tools will be integrated into the existing Online 
Returns Filing System. The long-term objective of the project is to build an XBRL-repository for the 
banking sector. 
The Reserve Bank identifies XBRL standards as a key development in the coming years, as 
indicated in the Review of Financial Sector Technology Vision Document, published in June 2007.
