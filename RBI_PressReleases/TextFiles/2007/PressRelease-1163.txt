RBI places on its website Report on  
Conditions of Work and Promotion of Livelihoods  
in the Unorganised Sector  
 
The Reserve Bank of India today placed on its website, the Report of an 
Internal Working Group set up to examine and to suggest a way forward to 
implement the recommendations of the Report on “Conditions of Work and Promotion 
of Livelihoods in the Unorganised Sector” of the National Commission for Enterprises 
in the Unorganised Sector. The National Commission was constituted  by the 
Government of India under the Chairmanship of Dr. Arjun K. Sengupta.  The National 
Commission for Enterprises in the Unorganised Sector submitted its Report to the 
Prime Minister on August 8, 2007.  
The National Commission for Enterprises in the Unorganised Sector 
highlighted the conditions of work and issues in livelihood promotion and proposed a 
set of recommendations for the unorganised sector. It also suggested a package of 
measures for addressing some of the critical issues relating to farm and non-farm 
sectors. It made some observations and recommendations relevant to the Indian 
financial sector largely drawing from the analysis made by a separate task force, 
constituted by the Commission under the Chairmanship of Prof. V. S. Vyas, which 
dealt with credit related issues of the non-agricultural unorganised sector.  
The Reserve Bank in its Mid-Term Review of the Annual Policy 2007-08 
(October 2007) proposed to constitute an internal working group to study various 
recommendations of the National Commission for Enterprises in the Unorganised 
Sector relevant to the financial system and to suggest an appropriate action plan for 
implementation of the acceptable recommendations pertaining to banking sector and 
the Reserve Bank of India. The Reserve Bank constituted the Internal Working Group 
(IWG) in November 2007.  
The Internal Working Group, in its Report, has made recommendations, 
among other things, to address the issues of credit allocation, expanding the 
outreach of banking services and improving the access of credit to various segments 
of population in the unorganised sector.
