(F) AML Guidelines 
1. Money Laundering  
The offence of Money Laundering has been defined in Section 3 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 
2002 (PMLA) as "whosoever directly or indirectly attempts to indulge or knowingly assists or knowingly is a 
party or is actually involved in any process or activity connected with the proceeds of crime and projecting it 
as untainted property shall be guilty of offence of money laundering". Money Laundering can be called a 
process by which money or other assets obtained as proceeds of crime are exchanged for "clean money" or 
other assets with no obvious link to their criminal origins. 
2. Anti-Money Laundering Guidelines The purpose of prescribing Anti-Money Laundering Guidelines is to prevent the system of Authorized Money 
Changers (AMCs) engaged in the purchase and / or sale of foreign currency notes / Travellers' cheques from 
being used for money laundering. Therefore, Anti-Money Laundering (AML) measures should include : 
a. Identification of Customer according to "Know Your Customer" (KYC) norms,  
b. Recognition, handling and disclosure of suspicious transactions,  
c. Appointment of Money Laundering Reporting Officer (MLRO),  
d. Staff Training,  
e. Maintenance of records,  
f. Audit of transactions.  
The following paragraphs contain broad guidelines to enable AMCs to formulate and put in place a proper 
policy framework for AML measures.  
3. Know Your Customer (KYC) – Identification of Customers 
For purchase of foreign exchange less than US $ 200 or its equivalent, photocopies of the identification 
document need not be kept on record. However, full details of the identification document should be 
maintained. 
For encashment of foreign exchange between US $ 200 and US $ 2000 or its equivalent, the photocopies of 
the identification document should be maintained for one year and completion of statutory audit.  
For encashment in excess of US $ 2000 or its equivalent, the photocopies of the identification document 
should be maintained for a minimum period of five years.  
4. Purchase of Foreign Exchange 
a) For encashment of foreign currency notes and / or Travellers' Cheques up to USD 500 or its equivalent, 
production of passport need not be insisted upon and any other suitable document of identification like ration 
card, driving license, etc. can also be accepted. 
b) For verification of the identity of customer for encashment in excess of USD 500 or its equivalent, a photo 
identity document such as passport, driving license, PAN Card, voter identity card issued by the Election 
Commission, etc. should be obtained  c) Requests for payment of sale proceeds in cash may be acceded to the extent of USD 1000 or its 
equivalent per transaction. All encashment within one month may be treated as single transaction for the 
purpose. Requests for payment in cash by foreign visitors / Non-Resident Indians may be acceded to the 
extent of USD 3000 or its equivalent. In all other cases AMCs should make payment by way of 'Account 
Payee' cheque / demand draft only.  
d) Where the amount of forex tendered for encashment by a non-resident or a person returning from abroad 
exceeds the limits prescribed for Currency Declaration Form (CDF), the AMC should invariably insist for 
production of declaration in CDF.  
5. In all cases of sale of foreign exchange, irrespective of the amount involved, for identification purpose 
the passport of the customer should be insisted upon. The sale of forex should be made only on personal 
application and identification. Payment in excess of Rs. 50,000/- towards sale of foreign exchange should be 
received only by the applicant’s crossed cheque / crossed cheque drawn on the bank account of the 
firm/company sponsoring the visit of the applicant / Banker’s cheque / Pay Order / Demand Draft. All 
purchases by a person within one month may be treated as single transaction for the purpose. Encashment 
Certificate, wherever required, should also be insisted upon.  
6. Establishment of business relationship  
Relationship with a business entity like a company / firm should be established only after obtaining and 
verifying suitable documents in support of name, address and business activity such as certificate of 
incorporation under the Companies Act, 1956, Memorandum of Association and Articles of Association, 
registration certificate of a firm (if registered), partnership deed, PAN Card, etc. A list of employees who would 
be authorized to transact on behalf of the company / firm and documents of their identification together with 
their signatures, should also be called for. 
Copies of all documents called for verification should be kept on record. 
7. Suspicious Transactions  
The AMC must ensure that its staff is vigilant against money laundering transactions at all times. An important 
part of the AML measures is determining whether a transaction is suspicious or not. A transaction may be of 
suspicious nature irrespective of the amount involved.  
Some possible suspicious activity indicators are given below: 
• Customer is reluctant to provide details / documents on frivolous grounds.  
• The transaction is undertaken by one or more intermediaries to protect the identity of the beneficiary 
or hide their involvement.  • Large cash transactions.  
• Size and frequency of transactions is high considering the normal business of the customer.  
• Change in the pattern of business transacted.  
The above list is only indicative and not exhaustive.  
8. Appointment of Money Laundering Reporting Officer (MLRO)  
a. An MLRO may be appointed by every AMC for monitoring transactions and ensuring compliance with the 
AML Guidelines issued by the Reserve Bank from time to time. Any transaction, that appears suspicious, may 
be put through after obtaining MLRO’s consent. The MLRO will also be responsible for reporting of suspicious 
transaction/s to the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU).  
b. The MLRO shall have reasonable access to all the necessary information/ documents, which would help 
him in effective discharge of his responsibilities.  
c. The responsibility of the MLRO may include :  
• Putting in place necessary controls for detection of suspicious transactions.  
• Receiving disclosures related to suspicious transactions from the staff or otherwise.  
• Deciding whether a transaction should be reported to the appropriate authorities  
• Training of staff and preparing detailed guidelines / handbook for detection of suspicious transactions.  
• Preparing annual reports on the adequacy or otherwise of systems and procedures in place to 
prevent money laundering and submit it to the Top Management within 3 months of the end of the 
financial year.  
9. Reporting of Suspicious Activity  
• To the extent possible, all suspicious transactions should be reported to the MLRO before they are 
undertaken.  
• Full details of all suspicious transactions, whether put through or not, should be reported, in writing, to 
the MLRO.  
• Any transaction which seems suspicious may be undertaken only with prior approval of MLRO.  
• If the MLRO is reasonably satisfied that the suspicious transaction has / may have resulted in money 
laundering, he should make a report to the appropriate authority viz. the FIU.  
10. Staff Training  All the managers and staff of the AMC must be trained to be aware of the policies and procedures relating to 
prevention of money laundering, provisions of the PMLA and the need to monitor all transactions to ensure 
that no suspicious activity is being undertaken under the guise of money changing. The steps to be taken 
when the staff come across any suspicious transactions (such as asking questions about the source of funds, 
checking the identification documents carefully, reporting immediately to the MLRO, etc.) should be carefully 
formulated by the AMC and suitable procedure laid down. The AMCs should have an ongoing training 
programme for consistent implementation of the AML measures 
11. Audit / Compliance  
The concurrent auditor should check all transactions to verify that they have been done in compliance with the 
anti-money laundering guidelines and have been reported as required. Compliance on the lapses, if any, 
recorded by the concurrent auditor should be put up to the Board. A certificate from the Statutory Auditor on 
the compliance with AML guidelines should be obtained at the time of preparation of the Annual Report and 
kept on record.  
12. Maintenance of records 
The following documents should be preserved for a minimum period of five years. 
• Records including identification obtained in respect of all transactions.  
• Statements / Registers prescribed by the Reserve Bank from time to time.  
• All Inspection / Audit / Concurrent Audit Reports.  
• Annual reports of the MLRO submitted to the Top Management in terms of paragraph 8 above.  
• Details of all suspicious transactions reported in writing or otherwise to the MLRO.  
• Details of all transactions involving purchase of foreign exchange against payment in cash exceeding 
Indian Rupees 1,000,000 from inter-related persons during one month.  
• All correspondence / reports with the appropriate authority in connection with suspicious transactions.  
• References from Law Enforcement Authorities, including FIU, should be preserved until the cases are 
adjudicated and closed. 
 
(G) Revocation of License 
  
Reserve Bank reserves the right to revoke the license granted to an FFMC at any time if the Reserve Bank is 
satisfied that (a) it is in public interest to do so or (b) the Full Fledged Money Changer has failed to comply
