RBI Announces Further Measures To Stimulate Growth 
The Central Board of the Reserve Bank of India met today at Kolkata. The meeting 
reviewed key economic, monetary and financial developments and the various steps taken 
since mid-September 2008 to preserve financial stability and arrest the moderation in the 
growth momentum in the context of the ongoing global financial crisis and the deepening 
recession in major economies of the world. 
 
 In pursuance of the resolutions considered and passed by the Central Board, it has 
been decided to take the following further measures to stimulate growth in the Indian 
economy:   
• In order to provide liquidity support to the housing sector, and particularly to housing 
finance companies (HFCs) which have been adversely affected by the recent 
financial market developments, it has been decided to provide a refinance facility of 
an amount of Rs 4,000 crore to the National Housing Bank (NHB) under the 
provisions of Section 17(4DD) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934. This refinance 
will be available against the NHB's loans and advances to HFCs. The facility will be 
available at the prevailing repo rate under the LAF for a period of 90 days. During this 
90-day period, the amount can be flexibly drawn and repaid. At the end of the 90-day 
period, the drawal can also be rolled over. This refinance facility will be available up 
to March 31, 2010. The utilisation of funds will be governed by the policy approved by 
the Board of the NHB.  
• With a view to mitigating the pressures on account of the recent developments on 
loan disbursements to Indian exporting companies and for honouring disbursements 
under export lines of credit extended at the behest of the Government of India to 
overseas financial institutions, sovereign governments and other entities for financing 
imports from India, it has been decided to provide a refinance facility to the EXIM 
Bank under the provisions of Section 17(4J) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934. 
The refinance facility will be of an amount of Rs 5,000 crore. It will be available at the 
prevailing repo rate under the LAF for a period of 90 days. During this 90-day period, 
the amount can be flexibly drawn and repaid. At the end of the 90-day period, the 
drawal can also be rolled over. This refinance facility will be available up to March 31, 
2010. The utilisation of funds will be governed by the policy approved by the Board of 
the EXIM Bank.  
 The Reserve Bank will continue to closely monitor the developments in the global 
and domestic financial markets and will take swift and effective action as appropriate. The 
Reserve Bank will endeavour to minimise the stress on various sectors of the economy on 
account of the international financial crisis and the global slowdown.  The policy objective is 
to ensure adequate availability of liquidity in the system and to maintain conditions 
conducive for flow of credit for all productive purposes, particularly to the housing, export 
and small and medium industry sectors.   2

quarter. The Board has scheduled meetings in Mumbai, Chennai and Kolkata each year. 
The post-budget meeting of the Board, traditionally held in New Delhi, is addressed by the 
Union Finance Minister. The other meetings of the Board are held in the remaining state 
capitals by rotation. The main function of the Central Board of the Reserve Bank is to 
provide overall direction to its affairs.
