RBI Announces Further Measures for Liquidity Management  
and Improving Credit Flow 
 
Dr. D. Subbarao, Governor, Reserve Bank of India, met select bankers from the public 
and the private sector including foreign banks, today to review the current liquidity and credit 
situation and to get their views on the way forward. The meeting was held in the Reserve 
Bank of India, Central Office, Mumbai. Deputy Governors, Dr. Rakesh Mohan, Shri V. 
Leeladhar and Smt. Usha Thorat and Executive Director Shri Anand Sinha were present. 
Based on this review, it has decided to take the following further measures: 
(i) On November 1, 2008, the Reserve Bank introduced a special refinance facility under 
Section 17(3B) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 under which all scheduled commercial 
banks (excluding RRBs) are provided refinance from the Reserve Bank equivalent to up to 1.0 
per cent of each bank's NDTL as on October 24, 2008 at the LAF repo rate up to a maximum 
period of 90 days. During this period, refinance can be flexibly drawn and repaid. It is clarified 
that this facility can be rolled over.  It has also been decided to continue this facility up to June 
30, 2009.  
(ii) On October 15, 2008, the Reserve Bank allowed banks to avail liquidity support under the 
LAF through relaxation in the maintenance of SLR to the extent of up to 1.5 per cent of their 
NDTL for the purpose of meeting the funding requirements of NBFCs and MFs. It has now 
been decided to expand this facility to enable banks to accommodate the funding needs of 
housing finance companies (HFCs). Banks may apportion the total accommodation allowed 
above between MFs, NBFCs and HFCs flexibly as per their business needs. The end date for 
this facility, which is currently March 31, 2009, has been extended to June 30, 2009.   There 
have been queries as to whether this facility can be used for existing exposures.  It is clarified 
that access to this facility is intended for fresh credit to MFs/NBFCs/HFCs and for 
renewal/rollover, on maturity, of existing facilities. (iii) On November 7, 2008, in the context of the global developments and in order to provide 
flexibility to Indian banks in managing their short-term funding requirements at their overseas 
offices, the Reserve Bank decided to provide forex liquidity to Indian public and private sector 
banks having foreign branches or subsidiaries, through forex swaps of tenors up to three 
months. It has been decided that this facility, which is available on request, will be made 
available up to June 30, 2009.   
(iv) In view of the difficulties being faced by exporters on account of the weakening of external 
demand, it has been decided to extend the period of entitlement of the first slab of post-
shipment rupee export credit, currently available  at a concessional interest rate ceiling of the 
benchmark prime lending rate (BPLR) minus 2.5 percentage points, from 90 days to 180 days 
with effect from December 1, 2008.
