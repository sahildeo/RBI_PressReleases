RBI asks banks to disseminate Information on Debt Restructuring Package 
 
The Reserve Bank of India today advised the banks to explain and disseminate the 
details of the RBI restructuring guidelines of August 2008 in order that the banks proactively 
address the problems faced by the micro and small enterprises (MSE) sector and take steps for 
timely restructuring, holding on operations and additional facilities. The guidelines could be 
explained and disseminated in meetings of the State Level Bankers' Committee (SLBC), the 
Reserve Bank advisory stated. The Reserve Bank has asked SLBC convenor banks to 
immediately organise special meetings of SLBCs where representatives of MSE sector could be 
invited to facilitate exchange of views and arrive at concrete measures in the interest of the 
sector and the banking system. The SLBC convenor banks have also been asked to take up, 
with the concerned authorities, issues which are not credit related but are coming in the way of 
smooth flow of credit to the MSE sector. Every Regional Office/Zonal Office of all banks should 
closely monitor the flow of credit to MSEs and also institute a help desk at key centres. 
 
  It may be recalled that the Reserve Bank has, between August and December 2008, 
announced a number of measures to improve credit delivery to the employment intensive MSE 
sector. These include, instructions to restructure the dues of SMEs where warranted and also 
continue to disburse loans against the sanctioned limits, exceptional regulatory treatment for 
second restructuring of exposures (other than exposures to commercial real estate, capital 
market exposures and personal / consumer loans) up to June 30, 2009, harmonising prudential 
norms on restructuring of advances with over all categories of debt restructuring mechanisms 
(other than those restructured on account of natural calamities) and certain other measures to 
enhance liquidity available to enable banks to extend finance to micro and small enterprises.  
 
Further, as per the existing instructions, banks are required to fix separate sub-limits, 
within the overall limits, specifically for meeting payment obligations in respect of purchases from 
SSIs either on cash basis or on bill basis while sanctioning/renewing credit limits to their large 
corporate borrowers enjoying working capital limits of Rs. 10 crore and above from the banking 
system. With a view to ensuring availability of adequate balance in the account for meeting the 
payment obligations to SSI units, banks are also advised to ensure that sale proceeds/other 
receipts of the borrower are credited to this account on a pro rata basis. Banks are required to 
closely monitor the operations in the sub-limits, particularly with reference to their corporate 
borrowers’ dues to SSI units by ascertaining periodically from their corporate borrowers, the 
extent of their dues to SSI suppliers and ensuring that the corporates pay off such dues before 
the ‘appointed day’/agreed date by using the balance available in the sub-limit so created. The 
instructions provide that if, at any time, the sub-limit is exhausted there is no bar on such 
payments being made from the other segment of the working capital limit. Similarly, if no 
payments are due to SSI suppliers, and the sub-limit remains unutilised/partly utilised, banks are 
free to allow their corporate borrowers to operate this limit for meeting other working capital 
expenses.
