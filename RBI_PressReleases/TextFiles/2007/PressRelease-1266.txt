RBI seeks Public Comment on Norms for  
Branch/Liaison Offices in India by Foreign Entities 
 
The Reserve Bank of India has proposed to delegate certain powers to 
authorised dealers regarding extension of validity period of liaison offices of 
foreign entities and closure of their branch/liaison offices in India. It has proposed 
to make the delegated powers effective from July 1, 2008 in order to provide 
necessary time to authorised dealers to assimilate the revised dispensation.  
 
Further, under the present provisions of Foreign Exchange Management 
Act, a person resident outside India requires prior approval of the Reserve Bank 
of India for establishing branch/liaison offices in India. The applications are 
considered by the Reserve Bank on case by case basis subject to the company 
meeting the eligibility criteria, such as, track record, financial position, etc.  with a 
view to achieving greater transparency, the Reserve Bank of India has also 
proposed to place in public domain eligibility criteria and procedural guidelines for 
establishment of branch and liaison offices by foreign entities in India.  
 
For the purpose of seeking public comments, the Reserve Bank has 
placed on its website, both - the draft circulars regarding delegation of powers for 
extension of validity period or closure of liaison offices of foreign entities in India 
and eligibility criteria and procedural guidelines for branch/liaison offices of 
foreign entities in India. Comments on these can be sent to The Chief General 
Manager, Foreign Exchange Department, Reserve Bank of India, Central Office 
(FID), Central Office Building, 11th Floor, S.B.S.Marg, Fort, Mumbai-400001 or 
by FAX (Fax No. 022-2261 0623) or by e-mail  latest by May 20, 2008.
