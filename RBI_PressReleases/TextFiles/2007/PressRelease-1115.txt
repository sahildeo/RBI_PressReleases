RBI Study on Courier/Postage Charges of Banks 
 
 The Reserve Bank of India has today placed on its website the details of 
courier/postage charges levied by banks for information to the public. 
  
It has been reported to the Reserve Bank of India that many banks charge for 
various services offered by them disproportionate to the cost incurred by them. It was 
decided to conduct studies in the matter and as a first study, information in respect of 
courier/postage charges levied for collection of outstation cheques and for sending 
statements/cheque books, etc., to the customer was collected. The results of the 
study have been compiled in the form of a table that has been put on the Reserve 
Bank's website (www.rbi.org.in). The Reserve Bank of India will be conducting such 
studies from time to time in respect of other charges and will put the results on the 
website.
