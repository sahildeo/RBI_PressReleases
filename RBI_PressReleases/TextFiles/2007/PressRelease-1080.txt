Market Borrowing Programme of State Governments - 2008-09 
 
The estimate of gross normal market borrowings of State Governments for the 
financial year 2008-09 is placed at Rs.59,000 crore taking into account the 
repayments of Rs.14,371 crore. The market borrowings of the State Governments 
will be raised in a phased manner depending upon their requirements. So far (up to 
June 17, 2008), six State Governments have raised Rs.5,912 crore through the sale 
of their State Development Loans (SDLs) through auction method.   
 
The State Governments/Reserve Bank of India will have the flexibility to 
review the borrowing requirements and bring about modifications in the borrowings 
keeping in view the emerging requirements of the State Governments, market 
conditions and other relevant factors. 
 
It may be recalled that the Annual Policy Statement for the year 2006-07 had 
proposed, inter alia, that States, at their discretion and initiative, would be 
encouraged to develop an advance indicative open market borrowing calendar with a 
view to disseminating information on borrowings of State Governments and usher in 
greater transparency.
