Special Market Operations 
 
Keeping in view the systemic implications of the liquidity and other related issues 
currently faced by Public Sector Oil Companies arising from the unprecedented 
escalation in international crude oil prices, the Reserve Bank of India had decided on May 
30, 2008 to put in place Special Market Operations (SMOs), for the smooth functioning of 
financial markets and for overall financial stability.  Accordingly it was decided to  
 
1. conduct open market operations (outright or repo at the discretion of RBI) in the 
secondary market through designated banks in oil bonds held by public sector 
oil marketing companies in their own accounts subject to an overall ceiling of 
Rs.1000 crore on any single day.  
 
2. provide equivalent foreign exchange through designated banks at market 
exchange rate to the oil companies.  
 
It was emphasized that these measures were adhoc, temporary in nature and were to be 
reviewed on a continuous basis. 
 
On a review of the operations, it has been decided to enhance the overall ceiling of open 
market operations to Rs.1,500 crore on any single day.  All other features of the scheme 
would remain unchanged.
