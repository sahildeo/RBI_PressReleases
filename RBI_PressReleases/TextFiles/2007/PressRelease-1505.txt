Respect Your Banknotes : RBI appeals to Public 
 The Reserve Bank of India today appealed to members of public not to use 
banknotes for making garlands, decorating pandals and places of worship or for 
showering on personalities in social events, etc. Such actions deface the 
banknotes and shorten their life. Banknotes should be respected as they are a 
symbol of the sovereign and not to misuse them enhancing their life.  The 
Reserve Bank has stated that it has been taking all measures to supply clean 
banknotes across the country and has urged the members of public to contribute 
their mite to its efforts.
