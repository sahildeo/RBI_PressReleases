Government of Manipur signs MoU with Reserve Bank of India 
The Government of Manipur and the Reserve Bank of India have, on        
May 21, 2008 signed a Memorandum of Understanding with regard to Urban Co-
operative Banks in the State of Manipur.  Consequent upon this, a State level Task 
Force for Urban Co-operative Banks (TAFCUB) has been constituted for Manipur.  
Smt. Sewali Choudhury, Regional Director for Assam and other North Eastern 
States, Reserve Bank of India, is the Chairman of the TAFCUB and  Shri H. Imocha 
Singh, Registrar of Cooperative Societies & Commissioner, Cooperation 
Department, Government of Manipur is its Co-Chairman.  The other members of 
the TAFCUB include a representative, each from State and National Federation of 
Urban Cooperative Banks, a nominee of State Government of Manipur and a 
representative of Urban Banks Department, Reserve Bank of India, Central Office, 
Mumbai. The first meeting of the TAFCUB will be held shortly. 
Similar MoUs have also been signed with the Governments of the States of 
Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand, 
Chattisgarh, Goa, Maharashtra, Assam, NCT of Delhi, Haryana, West Bengal, 
Tripura, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh. 
As part of its developmental role, the Reserve Bank would also be assessing 
the training,  computerisation needs of the Urban Co-operative Banks in the State 
of Manipur with the objective of upgrading their human resource skills and 
technological infrastructure so that they improve their operational efficiency and 
quality of management information systems. 
It may be recalled that in the Mid-Term Review of Annual Policy announced 
in October 2004, the Reserve Bank had announced that a vision document for 
Urban Co-operative Banks would be prepared.  Accordingly, the Reserve Bank 
placed in public domain a draft vision document in March 2005. As the Urban Co-
operative Banks are subject to dual control by the Reserve Bank and the State 
Governments, the vision document envisaged the signing of MoU between State 
Governments and the Reserve Bank of India to put in place an arrangement 
through which there is a convergence on the approach and remedial actions 
required to be taken for facilitating the development of the sector.  The vision 
document also proposed the constitution of a State Level Task Force for Urban Co-
operative Banks with representatives of State Government, State/National 
Federation of Urban Cooperative Banks and the Reserve Bank of India as its 
members, for the purpose of identifying the potentially viable Urban Cooperative 
Banks and drawing up a time-bound action plan for their revival by setting specific 
monitorable milestones.
