Besides being one of the earliest member countries participating voluntarily in the 
Financial Sector Assessment Programme (FSAP), India has been a forerunner in 
comprehensive self assessment of various international financial standards and codes. The 
Reserve Bank has also released a Synthesis Report in May 2002 and a Progress Report in 
January 2005.  The experience has thus far been very encouraging and the financial sector 
reforms have progressed well in recent years, enhancing the soundness of the financial 
system and promoting financial stability. 
 
 Consistent with this approach, it was considered appropriate and expedient for India 
to undertake a self assessment of financial sector stability and development, using the new 
Handbook on Financial Sector Assessment as the base as also any other pertinent 
documents for financial sector assessment. The handbook was published in September 
2005 jointly by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund in the aftermath of the 
Asian financial crisis and their experience in the conduct of assessment in member 
countries. The Government of India, in September 2006 decided in consultation with the 
Reserve Bank of India to constitute the 'Committee on Financial Sector Assessment'.
