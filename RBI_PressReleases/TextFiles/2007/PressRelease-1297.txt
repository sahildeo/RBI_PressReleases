RBI to release Data on G-Secs  
Ownership Pattern on Quarterly Basis 
The Reserve Bank of India today released data on ownership pattern of Government of India 
dated securities (G-Secs), for four quarters of 2007. It has, in consultation with the Government of India, 
decided to release the information regularly on a quarterly basis with a view to enhancing transparency in 
G-Sec market. The data, being collected on a quarterly basis, would be published in the RBI Bulletin for 
the months of March, June, September and December with a lag of one quarter.  The data are based on 
the information available with Subsidiary General Ledger (SGL) accounts maintained in the Public Debt 
Office – Negotiated Dealing System (PDO-NDS) in Mumbai which covers about 97 per cent of the total 
outstanding stock of Government of India dated securities. Besides, the ownership pattern of G-Secs held 
in the Constitutent SGL (CSGL) accounts has been collected from CSGL account holders and is included 
in the overall holding pattern.
