RBI releases Draft Guidelines on  
Prudential Norms for Off-balance Sheet Exposures of Banks  
The Reserve Bank of India today released on its website, draft guidelines on 
prudential norms for off-balance sheet exposures of banks for comments and 
feedback. Comments/feedback on the proposals contained in the draft guidelines 
may be sent within two weeks by email or by fax to  022-22705691 or to the Chief 
General Manager-in-Charge, Department of Banking Operations & Development, 
Reserve Bank of India, Central Office Building, 12th Floor, S.B.Singh Marg, Mumbai-
400001.  
It may be recalled that Paragraph 165 of the Annual Policy Statement of the 
Reserve Bank of India for 2008-09 proposed to review current stipulations regarding 
conversion factors, risk weights and provisioning requirements for specific off-
balance sheet exposures of banks and prescribe prudential requirements as 
appropriate, in view of the recent developments in the global financial markets. 
Accordingly, the requirements were reviewed and it is proposed to bring about 
certain modifications, as outlined in the draft guidelines, to the existing prudential 
norms applicable to the off-balance sheet exposures of the banks.
