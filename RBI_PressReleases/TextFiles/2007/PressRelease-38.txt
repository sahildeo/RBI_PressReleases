RBI releases Study on State Finances : 2008-09 
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) today released ‘State Finances: A Study of Budgets 
of 2008-09’, a publication that provides data, analysis and assessment of finances of State 
Governments. The publication presents data at both consolidated and disaggregated levels 
based on the State budgets for 2008-09. Statistical tables appended to the publication 
provide information on several fiscal parameters as well as detailed State-wise budgetary 
data covering both revenue and capital accounts. 
The Study highlights the noticeable improvement in the consolidated fiscal position of 
the State Governments evident during the recent years. The revenue account of States 
turned around from deficit to surplus during 2006-07 after a gap of two decades. The 
revenue surplus position has been proposed to be maintained in the revised estimates (RE) 
for 2007-08 as well as the budget estimates (BE) for 2008-09 at 0.5 per cent of GDP. 
Reflecting the improvement on the revenue account, the ratio of gross fiscal deficit to GDP 
was 1.9 per cent in 2006-07 (accounts). The gross fiscal deficit as a ratio to GDP was 
estimated higher at 2.3 per cent in 2007-08 (RE) on account of higher capital outlay, but is 
budgeted to decline to 2.1 per cent during 2008-09 though capital outlay to GDP ratio would 
be maintained at 2.7 per cent. The State Governments also generated a primary surplus (0.4 
per cent of GDP) during 2006-07 (accounts), which is estimated to turn into deficit of 0.1 per 
cent of GDP in line with increase in gross fiscal deficit, notwithstanding the increase in 
interest outgo in 2007-08 (RE) as well as 2008-09 (BE).  
According to the Study, several State Governments have already achieved the 
targets recommended by the Twelfth Finance Commission (TFC) and targets set under 
Fiscal Responsibility Legislations (FRL) with regard to elimination of revenue deficit and 
reduction in gross fiscal deficit to 3 per cent of Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP).  
During 2008-09, twenty-five States presented revenue surplus budgets and seventeen 
States have budgeted their gross fiscal deficit at less than 3 per cent of GSDP. The 
achievement of the TFC targets ahead of the recommended schedule by a number of State 
Governments reflects strong growth in tax revenues, both States’ own and devolution from 
the Centre, and higher grants-in-aid. The Study notes that while States have been able to 
scale up capital outlay, there has been some rationalisation of revenue expenditure during 
the FRL period. 
The Study points out that the outstanding liabilities of the State Governments, which 
had reached high levels in the first half of the current decade on account of large and 
persistent fiscal imbalances, have shown signs of improvement in the recent past. From the 
peak level of 33.2 per cent in 2004, the debt-GDP ratio of State Governments came down to 
28.3 per cent in 2007-08 (RE) and is budgeted at 27.4 per cent in 2008-09. The ratio of 
interest payments to revenue receipts of the State Governments has declined from a high 
level of 26.0 per cent in 2003-04 to 15.1 per cent in 2008-09 (BE).  The Study notes that there exists wide variation in fiscal performance across the 
State Governments notwithstanding the noticeable improvement in the consolidated fiscal 
position in the recent years. According to the Study, State-specific fiscal conditions including 
fiscal priority and low fiscal capacity play an important role in designing of expenditure 
pattern. In the State-wise section, this Study has introduced additionally an analysis of 
expenditure parameters on per capita basis. It has been observed that the correction in the 
revenue account and the consequent revenue surplus resulted in higher allocation of 
expenditure towards development and social sectors in most of the States.  
The Study emphasises a number of issues, which continue to be important for  State 
finances, such as sustaining the fiscal improvement achieved in recent years in the post-FRL 
period, making the fiscal correction durable through generation of adequate own revenues, 
improving the quality of expenditure through expenditure prioritisation as well as efficient 
service delivery, reducing the existing level of debt obligations notwithstanding the 
improvement in recent years, and providing adequate financial support to the local bodies. 
The publication has been prepared in the Division of State and Local Finances 
(DSLF) of the Department of Economic Analysis and Policy. Starting with 2001-02, this 
publication is available at RBI website (www.rbi.org.in). Comments on this publication may 
be sent to Director, Division of State and Local Finances, Department of Economic Analysis 
and Policy, Reserve Bank of India, Shahid Bhagat Singh Road, Mumbai 400 001. Comments
