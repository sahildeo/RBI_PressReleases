Macroeconomic and Monetary Developments First Quarter Review 2008-09 
The Reserve Bank today released the document “Macroeconomic and Monetary 
Developments: First Quarter Review 2008-09” to serve as a backdrop to the First Quarter 
Review of Annual Policy Statement for 2008-09 being announced on July 29, 2008. 
The highlights of this Review are: 
The Real Economy  
• According to the revised estimates released by the Central Statistical Organisation (CSO) in 
May 2008, the real GDP growth was placed at 9.0 per cent during 2007-08 as compared 
with 9.6 per cent in 2006-07. The deceleration in growth was on account of industry and 
services, offset partly by recovery in agriculture.  
• According to the Fourth Advance Estimates, the foodgrains production during 2007-08 was 
placed at an all-time high of 230.7 million tonnes, exhibiting an increase of 6.2 per cent over 
the previous year (217.3 million tonnes) predominantly on account of kharif foodgrains 
production. Barring sugarcane, all foodgrains and non-foodgrains are estimated to reach an 
all-time record production during 2007-08.   
• During April-May 2008 the index of industrial production recorded year-on-year expansion 
of 5.0 per cent as compared with 10.9 per cent during April-May 2007. The manufacturing 
sector recorded growth of 5.3 per cent during April-May 2008 (11.8 per cent during April-
May 2007), while the electricity sector recorded growth of 1.7 per cent (9.0 per cent during 
April-May 2007).  
• The infrastructure sector recorded growth of 3.5 per cent during April-May 2008 (6.9 per 
cent during April-May 2007), reflecting deceleration in all the sectors, except coal and crude 
petroleum. 
• Available information on the leading indicators of services sector activity during 2008-09 so 
far suggest acceleration in growth in respect of some indicators such as railway revenue 
earning freight traffic, tourist arrivals and export cargo handled by civil aviation as compared 
with corresponding period of 2007-08. On the other hand, growth decelerated in respect of 
cargo handled at major ports, various indicators of civil aviation, excluding export cargo and 
commercial vehicles production. 
Fiscal Situation 
• Available information on Central Government finances during April-May 2008 indicates that 
revenue deficit and gross fiscal deficit were higher than a year ago, both in absolute terms 
and as proportion to budget estimates. Gross primary deficit in April-May 2008 was also 
higher than a year ago. The widening of fiscal deficit of the Central Government during 
April-May 2008 was mainly on account of a sharp rise in plan expenditure over April-May 
2007. On the other hand, non-plan expenditure was contained mainly due to moderation in 
the growth of interest payments and major subsidies, and decline in defence expenditure.  2
 
• Gross and net market borrowings (dated securities and 364-day Treasury Bills) of the 
Central Government during 2008-09 (up to July 18, 2008) amounted to Rs.77,809 crore and 
Rs.42,819 crore, respectively, accounting for 44.3 per cent and 43.3 per cent, respectively,  
of the estimated market borrowings for the year. During the corresponding period of the 
previous year, gross and net borrowings accounted for 40.5 per cent and 33.5 per cent, 
respectively. 
• The cash balance of the Central Government remained in surplus during 2008-09 (up to 
July 18, 2008).  The surplus cash balance of the Central Government as on July 18, 2008 
was Rs. 19,767 crore. 
• During the current year so far (up to July 18, 2008), eight State Governments raised 
Rs.8,712 crore (14.8 per cent of gross allocation for the year) through auctions with a cut-off 
yield in the range 8.39-9.81 per cent as compared with Rs.7,153 crore by 13 State 
Governments (cut-off yield ranging from 8.30-8.57 per cent) during the corresponding 
period of the previous year. 
• The average daily utilisation of WMA and overdraft by the States during 2008-09 (up to July 
18, 2008) was Rs.351 crore as compared with Rs. 736 crore during the corresponding 
period of 2007-08. 
• The average investments by the States in Treasury Bills during 2008-09 (up to July 18, 
2008) amounted to Rs. 81,750 crore as compared with Rs. 70,608 crore during the 
corresponding period of 2007-08. 
Monetary and Liquidity Conditions 
• Growth in broad money (M ), year-on-year (y-o-y), was 20.5 per cent (Rs. 7,04,046 crore) 
3
on July 4, 2008 as compared with 21.8 per cent (Rs. 6,17,118 crore) a year ago.  
• Aggregate deposits of banks, y-o-y, expanded by 20.7 per cent (Rs.6,07,668 crore) on July 
4, 2008 as compared with 23.1 per cent (Rs. 5,50,653 crore) a year ago.  
• Non-food credit by scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) expanded by 25.9 per cent 
(Rs.4,85,709 crore), y-o-y, as on July 4, 2008 as compared with  24.6 per cent (Rs.3,69,109 
crore) a year ago.  
• Growth in reserve money, y-o-y, was 26.5 per cent on July 18, 2008 as compared with 29.0 
per cent a year ago. Adjusted for the first round impact of the hike in the cash reserve ratio, 
reserve money growth was 18.4 per cent as compared with 21.6 per cent a year ago.  
• Liquidity conditions continued to be influenced by movements in cash balances of the 
Central Government and capital flows. The Reserve Bank continued with the policy of active 
management of liquidity through appropriate use of cash reserve ratio (CRR) and open 
market operations (OMO), including MSS and LAF and other policy instruments at its 
command flexibly.  
Price Situation 
• Inflation has emerged as a global phenomenon in recent months.  
• Headline inflation firmed up further in major economies during the first quarter of 2008-09, 
reflecting the combined impact of higher food and fuel prices as well as strong demand 
conditions, especially in emerging markets. Notwithstanding inflation remaining above the 
targets/comfort zones, the monetary policy responses during the quarter were mixed in view 
of growth implications of the persistence of financial market turmoil following the US sub-
prime crisis. 
• Global commodity prices firmed up further during the first quarter of 2008-09, led by a sharp 
increase in the prices of crude oil as well as food and agricultural raw materials. Metal 
prices, which had increased during 2007-08, witnessed some moderation during the first 
quarter of 2008-09. International crude oil prices, represented by the West Texas 
Intermediate (WTI), touched a high of US $ 145.3 a barrel level on July 3, 2008. Food prices 
firmed up further during the first quarter of 2008-09, led by rice, maize and oilseeds/edible 
oils, reflecting surging demand (both consumption demand and demand for non-food uses 
such as bio-fuels production) and low stocks of major crops.

• Mirroring inflation trends in many advanced as well as emerging economies, various 
measures of inflation in India have also risen significantly since the beginning of this 
calendar year. Inflation based on the wholesale price index (WPI), increased from 7.7 per 
cent at end-March 2008 to 11.9 per cent by July 12, 2008, reflecting the impact of some 
pass-through of higher international crude oil prices to domestic prices as well as continued 
increase in the prices of iron and steel, basic heavy inorganic chemicals, machinery and 
machinery tools, oilseeds/edible oils/oil cakes and raw cotton on account of strong demand, 
international commodity price pressures and lower domestic 2007-08 rabi production of 
oilseeds. The seasonal hardening of vegetables prices as well as increase in prices of 
textiles has also contributed to inflation during 2008-09 so far. 
• Primary articles prices, y-o-y, increased by 10.1 per cent on July 12, 2008 on top of 11.1 per 
cent a year ago (it was 9.7 per cent at end-March 2008), reflecting increase in prices of food 
articles, especially  rice, wheat, fruits and milk, and non-food articles such as oilseeds and 
raw cotton. 
• Fuel group inflation increased to 16.9 per cent on July 12, 2008 from 6.8 per cent at end-
March 2008 (and a decline of 1.4 per cent a year ago), mainly reflecting the effect of some 
hikes in the prices of petrol, diesel and LPG  in June 2008 as well as continued increase 
(15-51 per cent) in the prices of freely priced petroleum products such as naphtha, furnace 
oil, aviation turbine fuel, bitumen and lubricants over end-March 2008. 
• Manufactured products inflation, year-on-year, rose further to 10.7 per cent on July 12, 2008 
from 7.3 per cent at end-March 2008 (and 4.8 per cent a year ago), reflecting increase in 
the prices of edible oils, oil cakes, textiles, chemicals, basic metals, alloys and products, 
and machinery and machine tools. Prices of sugar and grain mill products, however, eased 
somewhat from end-March 2008. 
• Consumer price inflation increased further during the first quarter of 2008-09 mainly due to 
increase in food prices and services (represented by the ‘miscellaneous’ group) prices. 
Various measures of consumer price inflation were placed in the range of 6.8-8.8 per cent 
during May/June 2008 as compared with 6.0-7.9 per cent in March 2008 and 5.7-7.8 per 
cent in June 2007. 
Financial Markets 
• Global financial markets witnessed generally uncertain conditions during April-July 2008. 
The financial market turbulence that had erupted in the US sub-prime mortgage market in 
mid-2007 gradually deepened towards early 2008. There was a cautious return of investor 
risk tolerance in the credit markets between mid-March 2008 and end-May 2008. Central 
banks continued to work together and also individually to improve liquidity conditions in 
financial markets. Financial markets, however, came under stress again in June 2008 and 
thereafter. 
• Indian financial markets remained largely orderly during the first quarter of 2008-09.  
• Interest rates in the money market mostly remained within the informal corridor set by 
reverse repo and repo rates during the quarter. Interest rates in the collateralised segment 
of the money market remained below the call rate during the quarter.  
• In the foreign exchange market, the Indian rupee generally depreciated against major 
currencies during the first quarter of 2008-09. The rupee had appreciated during 2007-08. 
• Yields in the Government securities market hardened during the quarter.  
• Indian equity markets recovered somewhat during April-May 2008 but declined thereafter in 
tandem with the trends in major international equity markets as well as edging up of 
domestic inflation.  4
The External Economy 
• India’s balance of payments position remained comfortable during 2007-08. The 
merchandise trade deficit, on a balance of payments basis, widened from US $ 63.2 billion 
in 2006-07 to US $ 90.1 billion in 2007-08. As proportion to GDP, the trade deficit increased 
from 6.9 per cent to 7.7 per cent.  Net surplus under invisibles (services, transfers and 
income taken together) expanded to US $ 72.7 billion in 2007-08 from US $ 53.4 billion in 
2006-07. The net invisible surplus offset 80.7 per cent of the trade deficit during 2007-08 as 
compared with 84.5 per cent during 2006-07. 
• During 2007-08, the widening of the trade deficit, mainly led by imports, resulted in a 
widening of current account deficit to US $ 17.4 billion (1.5 per cent of GDP) from US $ 9.8 
billion (1.1 per cent of GDP) in 2006-07. The current account deficit was financed by capital 
flows which remained large during 2007-08.  
• The strong momentum observed in FDI inflows during the year 2007-08 continued during 
2008-09, with inflows during April-May 2008 amounting to US $ 7.7 billion. In respect of 
FIIs, however, there were net outflows of US $ 5.6 billion up to July 11, 2008. NRI deposits 
recorded net inflows of US $ 292 million during April-May 2008 as against net outflows of 
US $ 559 million during April-May 2007.   
• According to the data released by the Directorate General of Commercial Intelligence and 
Statistics (DGCI&S), India’s merchandise exports posted a growth of 21.7 per cent during 
April-May 2008 (24.2 per cent during April-May 2007). Imports grew at 31.8 per cent as 
compared with 37.9 per cent a year ago. Non-oil imports recorded an increase of 24.6 per 
cent (43.8 per cent a year ago); oil imports increased by 48.6 per cent during April-May 
2008 as against 25.7 per cent in April-May 2007. Merchandise trade deficit during April-May 
2008 increased to US $ 20.7 billion from US $13.9 billion a year ago. 
• Foreign exchange reserves increased by US $ 110.5 billion during 2007-08 to US $ 309.7 
billion. As on July 18, 2008, India’s foreign exchange reserves were US $ 307.1 billion.
