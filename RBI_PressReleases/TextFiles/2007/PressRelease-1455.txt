RBI releases Second Draft of Guidelines on 
Recovery Agents for Public Comments 
The Reserve Bank of India today placed on its website, the second draft of 
the Guidelines on Recovery Agents for public comments. Views / comments on 
this Draft may be sent within 10 days to the Chief General Manager-in-Charge, 
Department of Banking Operations & Development, Reserve Bank of India, 
Central Office Building, 12th Floor, Shahid Bhagat Singh Road, Mumbai–400001. 
Views/comments can also be faxed to 22705691 or sent by email  
The revised guidelines include provision of recording of calls made by 
recovery agents to customers and vice versa, placing of updated list of recovery 
agents on bank's website, periodical verification of antecedents of employees of 
recovery agents which may include verification through police, additional 
conditions for repossession of assets. The revised guidelines have also provided 
for continuation of recovery proceedings if the borrower continuously makes 
frivolous/vexatious complaints and utilisation of credit counsellors’ services if the 
case of a particular borrower deserves sympathetic consideration. Keeping in view 
the fact that a large number of agents have to be trained throughout the country, 
the revised guidelines have permitted banks to have tie up arrangements with 
Indian Institute of Banking and Finance (IIBF) and other institutes/ bank’s own 
training colleges so that every agent passes the same examination conducted by 
IIBF all over India in a period of one year.   
The Reserve Bank of India had released the first draft of the guidelines for 
public comments on November 30, 2007. Based on the feedback received from 
banks/individuals/organisations, the guidelines have been revised and a second 
draft has been released today.
