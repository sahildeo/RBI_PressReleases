SECOND LIQUIDITY ADJUSTMENT FACILITY (SLAF) ON  
REPORTING FRIDAYS 
At present, Reserve Bank of India operates a Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) 
to inject/absorb liquidity through daily repos/reverse repos auctions. These 
operations are conducted in the forenoon between 9.30 A.M. and 10.30 A.M.  
In response to suggestions from the market participants for fine-tuning the 
management of bank reserves on the last day of the maintenance period, it has 
been decided to introduce a second LAF (SLAF) on reporting Fridays, with effect 
from August 1, 2008. The SLAF will be conducted between 4.00 PM and 4.30 
PM. In case the reporting Friday is a Bank holiday in Mumbai, then the SLAF 
would be conducted on the immediate preceding working day. 
The salient features of SLAF are same as those of LAF. However, the settlement 
for the LAF and SLAF will be conducted separately and on gross basis. 
 
SLAF will be subject to review and modifications as necessary, based on 
experience.
