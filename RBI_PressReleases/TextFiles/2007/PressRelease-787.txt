Reserve Bank Cancels the Licence of  The Anubhav  
Co-operative Bank Ltd., Basavakalyan, Karnataka 
In view of the fact that the Anubhav Co-operative Bank Ltd., Basavakalyan, (Karnataka) had 
ceased to be solvent, all efforts to revive it in close consultation with the Government of Karnataka 
had failed and the depositors of the bank were being inconvenienced by continued uncertainty, the 
Reserve Bank of India delivered the order canceling its licence to the bank after the close of business 
on August 14, 2008. The Registrar of Co-operative Societies, Karnataka has also been requested to 
issue an order for winding up of the bank and appoint a Liquidator for the bank. It may be highlighted 
that on liquidation every depositor is entitled to repayment of his deposits up to a monetary ceiling of 
Rs.1,00,000/- from the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC).    
 The bank was granted a licence by Reserve Bank on February 12, 1997 to commence 
banking business. The statutory inspection conducted by Reserve bank with reference to its financial 
position as on March 31, 2007 revealed that the financial position of the bank had sharply deteriorated 
compared to that of the previous inspection conducted with respect to its position as on March 31, 
2005. The deposits were eroded to the extent of 73.6%. The bank was facing severe liquidity 
problems and had resorted to heavy borrowing during the year. It also could not meet all 
commitments to its depositors. In view of the critical liquidity position and the other deficiencies 
observed during the scrutiny,  in order to protect the interest of the depositors,  the bank was placed 
under directions under Section 35A of the Banking Regulation Act 1949(AACS) on January 23, 2008 
restricting its operations including placing a ceiling of Rs.500/- for withdrawal of deposits by each 
depositor.  Subsequently a notice was issued to the bank on February 08, 2008 asking it to show 
cause as to why the licence granted to it to conduct banking business should not be cancelled.  
 After taking into consideration the reply submitted by the bank and after examining all options 
for its revival, the Reserve Bank of India took the extreme measure of canceling the licence of the 
bank in the interest of the bank's depositors.  With the cancellation of its licence and commencement 
of liquidation proceedings, the process of paying the depositors of the Anubhav Co-operative Bank 
Ltd., the amount insured as per the DICGC Act will be set in motion. 
 Consequent to the cancellation of its licence, the Anubhav  Co-operative Bank Ltd. is 
prohibited from carrying on 'banking business' as defined in Section 5(b) of the Banking Regulation 
Act, 1949(AACS) including acceptance and repayment of deposits.

Urban Banks Department, Reserve Bank of India, Bangalore. His contact details are as : Postal 
Address: 10/3/8, Nrupathunga Road, Bangalore 560 001. Telephone Number: (080) 2221 3033 Fax
