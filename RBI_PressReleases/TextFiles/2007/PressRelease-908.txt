The terms of reference of the working group are :  
 
(i) To study the structure of umbrella organisations of financial co-operative 
institutions/banks, as prevalent in other parts of the world, especially in relation to 
raising of capital and intra co-operative group support system.  
 
(ii) To study the existing structure and legal framework for UCBs in India and to examine 
the need and scope for a federated structure/umbrella organisation for UCBs at the 
state level. 
 
(iii) To suggest appropriate supervisory and regulatory framework to facilitate emergence 
of such umbrella organisation(s) for UCBs, taking into consideration the international 
experiences and systems.  
 
(iv) To study and suggest modalities for setting up an appropriate mutual 
assistance/revival fund for urban co-operative banks and the nature of support that 
could be provided by such fund.  
 
Urban Banks Department, Central Office of Reserve Bank of India will provide the 
necessary secretarial assistance to the Group. 
 
The Group will submit its report within three months of the first meeting. The first 
meeting of the Group was held on July 8, 2008 
 
There are a large number of Primary (Urban) Cooperative Banks (UCBs) in the 
country forming a heterogeneous group in terms of size and spread. Many of these banks are 
very small in size and reach. They compete with larger participants in the same banking 
space. Over the years, a number of UCBs have become weak and non-viable, thus posing 
systemic risk to the cooperative banking sector. They have limited avenues for raising capital 
funds as UCBs cannot go in for public issue of shares. At the same time, there are a number 
of UCBs in the sector that are financially strong and viable. Some sort of cooperative bonding 
and mutual support system could make the sector strong and vibrant. Looking at various 
successful federal models internationally, especially in Europe and USA, a need was felt for 
an umbrella organisation for UCBs that will be in a position to channelise their resources, 
aggregate their needs and also lend credibility through mutual support in the financial market. 
A working group constituted to examine issues relating to augmenting of capital of primary 
(urban) co-operative bank (UCBs) had also observed that it might be necessary to facilitate 
emergence of umbrella organisations for UCBs to enhance public confidence in the sector.
