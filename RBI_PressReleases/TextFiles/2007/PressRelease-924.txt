RBI Governor conferred Honorary Fellowship of LSE 
Governor, Dr. Y.V. Reddy, has been conferred the Honorary Fellowship of 
the London School of Economics and Political Science, London (LSE) at an 
official ceremony in London on July 17, 2008.  
 
The oration given by Lord Nicholas Stern of Brentford on this occasion read: 
“Chairman, Dr. Yaga Venugopal Reddy (YV) joined the Indian Administrative 
Service in 1964 when it was the most elite of organisations not only in terms of 
analytical and leadership abilities but also in the embodiment of integrity and 
effectiveness in administration. It was designed to bring the highest quality and 
standards to the service. These were the inspiring years of the building of post-
independent India. Governor Reddy has been committed to service, to integrity 
and to fair play all his life.  We are reliably informed that an extract from his 
reference on graduating from college was that “he is a brilliant, young man with a 
zeal for hard work. He impressed me by his industry and sincere work. He 
organised a night school during his under-graduation at Vivekananda College in 
Madras. He is always genial and respectful towards all”: ‘under-graduation’ means 
‘whilst studying as an undergraduate’ and is an example of the great efficiency of 
Indian English.  He went on to do his M.A. in Economics at Madras University and 
his Ph.D. at Osmania University.  
YV Reddy became the twenty first Governor of the Reserve Bank of India on 
September 6, 2003. Prior to this he had been with the Finance Ministry, later 
becoming Secretary to the Government of India. He has also served as Executive 
Director for India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Bhutan on the Board of the 
International Monetary Fund. Earlier he had served a six year tenure with the 
Reserve Bank of India as its Deputy Governor. Governor Reddy is the Chairman of 
the BIS Asian Consultative Council (ACC). He is also the Chairperson of 
SAARCFINANCE, a Group of Governors of the central banks of SAARC member 
countries.  
His boss in his first Indian Civil Service job and a friend who has known him for 
over 40 years, BPR Vithal (former Registrar of Osmania University) says that 
Governor Reddy’s approach to economic issues is to place them in a broad social 
perspective and test all economic analyses within that perspective. KV Kamath, the 
chief executive of ICICI (one of the largest commercial Banks in India) says of 
Governor Reddy “He has brilliantly managed to balance growth imperatives with 
stability. This he has done using his enormous technical expertise in the area of 
monetary policy and applying it judiciously to a growth environment as seen in 
India.” According to Narayana Murthy, the chairman and chief mentor of Infosys 
Technologies, a company at the heart of the Bangalore IT industry, who sat on the 
board of  RBI “Dr Reddy is called the Guru by all of us on the board of the RBI because of his extraordinary ability to explain complex macroeconomic concepts in 
simple words. He is a gentleman and a scholar,” he says. 
Governor Reddy has always been committed to the cause of the under privileged, 
a commitment which has never been lost in the complex world of international 
finance. As he has said “You can be an economic powerhouse but your task is to 
make sure that people inhabiting the country have a reasonable standard of living”. 
He directly links financial stability to social protection: as Governor Reddy says 
“You don’t have social insurance mechanisms, you don’t have risk mitigation 
mechanisms for a large number of people.”  And he goes beyond protection to the 
role of policy in directly promoting standards of living; thus he is committed to the 
Reserve Bank’s financial inclusion programme, which encourages banks to reach 
out to India’s poor people and translates documents into several of the country’s 
regional languages.  
He is described as the Governor who has the courage to implement policies which 
are fair and for the benefit of all people, motivated by strong principles of economic 
management and constantly recognising the needs of poor people. He has been 
recognised as a leader who is firm, flexible and fair and is well respected by all his 
staff. Notwithstanding the intense demands of his job he is a voracious reader and 
in all my meetings with him he has raised something interesting that he has 
recently read, from the most esoteric economics to the most profound novels.   
Governor Reddy maintains a strong commitment to academic pursuits and has 
many publications to his credit mainly in areas relating to finance, planning and 
public enterprises. He holds Visiting Professorships at a number of universities in 
India. He has been a Visiting Fellow at the LSE. He was ‘the life force’ in setting up 
the IG Patel Chair and the India Observatory at the LSE in honour of our former 
Director whose name the Chair carries and which I have the privilege to hold. He is 
indeed in the great tradition of inspired, distinguished and humble leadership 
embodied in his predecessor, IG Patel as Governor of the Reserve Bank of India. 
Governor YV Reddy is an outstanding individual who has distinguished himself 
through his knowledge, service and commitment not only to India but to the wider 
global community. We are honoured that he is accepting an Honorary Fellowship 
at the School. 
Chairman, I ask that Dr Yaga  Reddy be admitted as an Honorary Fellow of the 
London School of Economics and Political Science.” 
The others who were conferred the Honorary Fellowship by the LSE, along with Dr. 
Y.V Reddy, are: Ms. Presiley, Baxendale, QC, a leading mediator; Ms. Dame 
Lynne J. Brindley, DBE, Chief Executive, British Library; Sir Peter Lampl, 
Chairman and founder of The Sutton Trust; and Mr. Robert E Rubin, Chairman of 
the Executive Committee, Citigroup and who was secretary of the US Treasury 
from 1995 to 1999.

Sir Partha Dasgupta, Prof. Lord Desai, Mr. Nitin Desai, Dr. Jagan N. Khosla, Prof. 
Kakkadan N. Raj, Prof. Amartya Kumar Sen and Dr. Ratan N. Tata. 
The Court of Governors, on the recommendation of the Nominations 
Committee and with the concurrence of the Academic Board, elects an Honorary 
Fellow of the LSE. The Honorary Fellowship is considered to be one of the most 
prestigious awards that the LSE bestows. Not more than six Honorary Fellows are 
elected in any one year. Honorary Fellows have no formal duties but the LSE 
hopes to have the general support of its Fellows and to have their company at 
some of its public occasions.
