 Major sources of accretion to foreign exchange reserves during the April-March 2007-08 have 
been Foreign Direct Investment, Portfolio Investment, External Commercial Borrowings (ECBs), Banking 
Capital and Short-Term Credit. The accretion to the foreign exchange reserves was US $ 92.2 billion on a 
BoP basis (excluding valuation effects) during April-March 2007-08. Valuation gain, reflecting the 
appreciation of major currencies against the US dollar, accounted for US $ 18.3 billion in total reserves 
during April-March 2007-08 as against a valuation gain of US $ 11.0 billion during the corresponding 
period of previous year. The foreign exchange reserves have increased by an amount of US $ 110.5 
billion during April-March 2007-08 including the valuation effects as compared with an increase of US $ 
47.6 billion during April-March 2006-07.
