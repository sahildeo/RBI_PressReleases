RBI to publish Monthly Data on  
Bank Transactions in NEFT and RTGS 
 
The Reserve Bank of India today published, on its website, the total monthly 
volume of bankwise transactions on the National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT) 
and Real Time Gross Settlement System (RTGS) for the months of June and July 
2008.  The Reserve Bank will henceforth publish this data regularly.  
 
The Reserve Bank of India had introduced NEFT system in 2005 and RTGS 
in 2004. As on date, the total number of banks participating in NEFT is 87 and that in 
RTGS is 96. There are over 49,000 bank branches participating in these two 
electronic funds transfer systems.  
National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT) system is a nationwide funds 
transfer system to facilitate transfer of funds between NEFT enabled bank branches. 
The beneficiary using NEFT system gets the credit on the same day or the next day 
depending on the time of settlement.  
The acronym "RTGS" stands for Real Time Gross Settlement. RTGS system 
is a funds transfer mechanism where transfer of money takes place from one bank to 
another on a "real time" and on "gross" basis. This is the fastest possible money 
transfer system through the banking channel.
