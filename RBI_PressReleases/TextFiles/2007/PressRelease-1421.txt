The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had, on January 31, 2003, issued a Press Note 
on conclusions of a study conducted by its Department of Economic Analysis and Policy 
(DEAP) on Sources of Accretion to Foreign Exchange Reserves during April-November 
2002. Subsequent to this, the RBI has been regularly updating and releasing information 
on ‘Sources of Accretion to Foreign Exchange Reserves’ through press releases which

 Major sources of accretion to foreign exchange reserves during the April- 
December 2007 have been Portfolio Investment, External Commercial Borrowings 
(ECBs) and Short-Term Credit. The accretion to the foreign exchange reserves was US 
$ 67.2 billion on a BoP basis (excluding valuation effects) during April-December 2007. 
Valuation gain, reflecting the appreciation of major currencies against the US dollar, 
accounted for US $ 8.9 billion in total reserves during April-December of 2007 as against 
a valuation gain of US $ 9.4 billion during the corresponding period of previous year. The 
foreign exchange reserves have increased by an amount of US $ 76.1 billion during 
April-December 2007 including the valuation effects against an increase of US $ 25.6 
billion during April-December 2006.
