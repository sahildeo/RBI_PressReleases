Licence of Rohe Ashtami Sahakari Urban Bank Ltd., Roha, Dist. Raigad Cancelled 
The Reserve Bank of India cancelled the licence of The Rohe Ashtami Sahakari Urban 
Bank Ltd., Roha, Dist. Raigad, Maharashtra on September 9, 2008. The bank had ceased to be 
solvent, all efforts to revive it in close consultation with the Government of Maharashtra had failed 
and the depositors were being inconvenienced by continued uncertainty. The Registrar of Co-
operative Societies has also been requested to issue an order for winding up the bank and 
appoint a liquidator.  It may be highlighted that on liquidation, every depositor is entitled to 
repayment of his/her deposits up to a ceiling of Rs. 1,00,000/- (Rupees one lakh only) from the 
Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) under usual terms and conditions.  
The bank was granted licence to commence banking business on October 26, 1987. The 
statutory inspection of the bank as on March 31, 2006 indicated that its financial position was 
impaired on which certain operational instructions were issued. The next inspection of bank with 
reference to its financial position as on March 31, 2007 revealed overall deterioration in its 
financial position. In order to conserve its liquidity and prevent preferential payments, the bank 
was issued directions under Section 35 A of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (As applicable to 
Co-operative Societies) restricting its operations, including placing a ceiling of Rs. 500/- on 
withdrawal of deposits. 
The bank was served a notice on May 2, 2008 to show cause as to why the licence 
granted to it should not be cancelled and why steps should not be taken to wind up the bank. The 
reply submitted by the bank was not found satisfactory and hence not acceptable. 
Keeping in view the impaired financial position of the bank and the absence of any 
concrete proposal for merger, the possibility of revival of the bank was remote. Therefore, the 
Reserve Bank of India took the extreme measure of cancelling the licence in the interest of the 
bank's depositors. With the cancellation of its licence and commencement of liquidation 
proceedings, the process of paying the depositors of the bank will be set in motion subject to the 
terms and conditions of the Deposit Insurance Scheme. 
Consequent to the cancellation of its licence, The Rohe Ashtami Sahakari Urban Bank 
Ltd., is prohibited from carrying on ‘banking business’ as defined in Section 5(b) of the Banking 
Regulation Act, 1949 (As applicable to Co-operative Societies).

Manager, Urban Banks Department, Reserve Bank of India, Mumbai. His contact details are
