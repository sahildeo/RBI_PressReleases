RBI places Report on Interest Rate Futures 
on its Website for Comments 
The Reserve Bank of India has today placed on its website the Report of 
the Working Group on Interest Rate Futures for public comments. Interest Rate 
Futures (IRF) were introduced in India in June 2003. In the context of continued 
financial market developments, the Annual Policy Statement of April 2007 had 
proposed to set up a Working Group under the aegis of the Technical Advisory 
Committee on Money, Foreign Exchange and Government Securities Markets. 
Accordingly, on August 9, 2007, the  Technical Advisory Committee constituted a 
Working Group on Interest Rate Futures (Chairman: Shri V K Sharma, Executive 
Director, RBI) to review the experience gained with IRF with particular reference 
to product design issues and make recommendations for activating the 
instrument. 
The Group was also required to revisit the recommendations of the earlier 
Committees in this area and examine regulatory requirements as well as the 
scope and extent of participation of non-residents while making its own 
recommendations. The Reserve Bank had also, on October 30, 2007, 
announced in its Mid-term Review of the Annual Policy that the Report would be 
placed in the public domain (para 124) for public comment.  
         The Report has, inter alia, taken into account the views of market 
participants as well as the international experience. The recommendations of the 
Group were presented to the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) for Money, 
Foreign Exchange and Government Securities Markets. The suggestions made 
and views expressed by the TAC are incorporated in the Report. 
          Comments and suggestions on the Report may please be addressed to 
the Chief General Manager, Financial Markets Department, Reserve Bank of 
India, Central Office, Mumbai or through email.
