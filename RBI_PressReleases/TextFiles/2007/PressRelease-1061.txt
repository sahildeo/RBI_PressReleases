RBI to introduce Speed Clearing for Outstation Cheques in Mumbai 
 
 The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will introduce, from June 25, 2008, "Speed 
Clearing" for outstation cheques for all the member banks in the jurisdiction of 
Brihan-Mumbai Bankers' Clearing House (BBCH). "Speed Clearing" leverages the 
technology of core or centralised banking solution (CBS) of banks which enables 
them to access details of all account holders from any branch.  
 
 Banks including public sector, private sector, cooperative and foreign banks, 
which are members of BBCH and have implemented CBS, can now locally pay 
outstation cheques of branches covered under CBS without having to physically send 
the cheque to the branch of the drawee for clearing. Customers would in such cases 
get credit on T+1 basis ('T' being cheque presentation day at the clearing house) 
provided the other conditions for passing the cheques are met. In other words, 
outstation cheques drawn on branches covered under the CBS will effectively be 
treated as local cheques for clearing purposes saving time and cost of collection, 
thus benefiting the customers.
