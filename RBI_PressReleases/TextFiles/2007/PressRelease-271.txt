Augmentation of resources of SIDBI and NHB  
  
The Reserve Bank had announced vide Press Release No.2008-2009/697 dated 
November 15, 2008, certain measures to ensure the growth momentum in the employment-
intensive sectors of micro and small enterprises and housing. Accordingly, the domestic 
scheduled commercial banks have been allocated amounts to an extent of Rs.2,000 crore and 
Rs.1,000 crore, for contribution to Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises (MSME) (Refinance) 
Fund with Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) and Rural Housing Fund with 
National Housing Bank (NHB), respectively. The above allocations have been made in advance 
on the basis of the banks’ projected shortfall in achievement of sub-target of 10 per cent for 
lending to Weaker Section category as on the last reporting Friday of March 2009.   
 
It may be recalled that as announced in the Annual Policy Statement for the year 2008-
09, the domestic scheduled commercial banks were advised that the shortfall in lending to 
weaker sections will also be taken into account for the purpose of allocating amounts for 
contribution to the Rural Infrastructure Development Fund (RIDF) maintained with National 
Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) or funds with other Financial 
Institutions, as specified by the Reserve Bank, with effect from April 2009.  The above 
allocations now made to banks for placing with SIDBI and NHB will be adjusted against the 
banks’ future allocations, if any, which may be made during the year 2009-2010 on the basis of 
the actual shortfall in achievement of priority sector lending target/sub-targets as on the last 
reporting Friday of March 2009.
