Welcoming the Finance Minister, the Governor stated that the Budget was 
broadly consistent with the overall objectives of achieving growth along with price 
stability.  The Finance Minister explained the philosophy of the Budget.  He said 
that India's growth story will be maintained.  Accordingly, the Budget has taken 
measures to stimulate private consumption through appropriate excise and 
income tax reduction and through enhanced public expenditure, particularly in 
rural areas, and in education and health. He also mentioned that the investment 
momentum was being maintained. The Budget, by stimulating consumption and incentivising investments, would help moderate the downside risks that could 
arise due to the anticipated slowdown in global growth. He explained the 
rationale of the agricultural loan waiver scheme, which was essential for the 
welfare of small and marginal farmers. He said that the banks would be 
appropriately compensated. He emphasised that it was important to accelerate 
the extension of credit to farmers. 
 
The members of the Reserve Bank Board unanimously congratulated the 
Finance Minister on the Budget and commented on a range of issues.  The 
Directors lauded the Budget for its unprecedented emphasis on skill development 
and its attention to research and development, which not only addressed current 
constraints but would also enhance Indian competitiveness in the future.  This 
would help growth in manufacturing and employment.  At the same time they 
emphasised the need to make a quantum jump in agricultural growth keeping in 
view the need for food security apart from enhancing rural employment. 
 
The Governor said that the Reserve Bank would work closely with the 
Government and the banks to ensure that the loan waiver scheme was   
implemented within the announced time frame, so as to serve the interest of the 
farmers and improve credit flow while subserving the interest of the banking 
system.
