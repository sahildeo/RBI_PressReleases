 RBI Invites Comments on 'Seasonal Movements in Inflation' Report  
The Reserve Bank of India has today placed on its website - Report of the Internal 
Technical Group on 'Seasonal Movements in Inflation' for public comments. Comments 
on this Report may be sent to the Director, Forecasting Division, Department of 
th
Statistical Analysis and Computer Services, Reserve Bank of India, C-8, 6 Floor,

The Reserve Bank of India had set up an Internal Technical Group on 'Seasonal 
Movements in Inflation', to examine the pattern of seasonal behaviour of inflation and 
gauge the inflationary pressures in Indian economy. The Group analysed, in detail, 
different ways of presentation of inflation, viz., annual point-to-point inflation based on 
weekly Wholesale Price Index (WPI), inflation based on moving average of 4/12/24/52 
weeks of WPI, fixed base, month-over-month, etc. The Group also reviewed merits and 
demerits of practices followed by some other countries on inflation presentation. Further, 
the Group examined the nature of seasonality in WPI at aggregate and disaggregate 
level, identifying the commodities in WPI basket showing high seasonality. Similar 
analysis was carried out to examine the nature of seasonality in various Consumer Price 
Indices(CPIs).  
The Group has concluded that all the price series in India (viz., WPI, CPI) have 
peak/trough months around the same time of the year mainly due to seasonality in food 
prices. The analysis revealed that, inflation rate based on annual point-to-point basis, 
supplemented with month-over-month and fixed base (using seasonally adjusted price 
series) provide better signal regarding price dynamics in the Indian economy.
