RBI seeks Comments on Draft Guidelines on Uniform Accounting 
for Repo/Reverse Repo Transactions 
The Reserve Bank of India has today placed on its website "Draft Guidelines for 
Accounting for Repo/Reverse Repo Transactions" for comments/views. Comments/views 
on the draft guidelines may, by December 15, 2008, be sent to the Chief General Manager, 
Internal Debt Management Department, Reserve Bank of India, Mumbai 400001 or can be 
emailed. 
The proposed draft guidelines seek to revise the guidelines issued in March 2003 
which treated 'repo' as a combination of two independent sale/purchase transactions as per 
the legal provisions prevailing then. The Reserve Bank of India (Amendment) Act 2006 
subsequently defined 'repo' as "an instrument for borrowing funds by selling securities with 
an agreement to repurchase the securities on a mutually agreed future date at an agreed 
price which includes interest for the funds borrowed". The accounting norms now propose 
to capture the economic essence of 'repo' as a collateralised lending/ borrowing transaction 
that is structured as a legal sale / purchase of securities as recognised by the RBI 
(Amendment) Act, 2006. The amendment in the accounting norms would bring such 
transactions on to the balance sheet of the repo participants in its true economic sense, 
thus enhancing transparency.    
The salient features of the revised draft guidelines are: 
• The securities sold under repo would continue to be reflected in the investment 
account of the repo seller. Accordingly, the repo buyer would not reflect the 
securities acquired under repo in his investment account. The actual movement of 
securities between repo buyer and repo seller would, however, be reflected through 
contra entries in the balance sheet.   
• The securities acquired under repo would continue to be reckoned as liquid assets 
for the purpose of Section 24 of BR Act, 1949 in the books of the repo buyer. 
Accordingly, the securities sold under repo would not be accorded the benefit of 
Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) for the repo seller, even though the seller's 
investment account would continue to show the securities sold under repo. 
• The liabilities on account of repo borrowing would be included in the net demand 
and time liabilities (NDTL) calculation for maintenance of cash reserve ratio (CRR). 
However, inter-bank repo transactions would continue to be netted, as hitherto.  
•  The movement of securities should also be accounted for in the books of the 
counterparties by showing it as contra entries for the sake of greater transparency.   
The Reserve Bank of India will finalise and issue the guidelines after examining the 
views / feedback received.

Chief General Manager 
Press Release : 2008-2009/689 Guidelines for accounting for Repo / Reverse repo transactions 
                         
 To All RBI regulated entities (Commercial Banks, Co-operative Banks, Primary Dealers, 
Financial Institutions, RRBs and NBFCs)  
Dear Sir,                          
Guidelines for accounting for Repo / Reverse repo transactions  
Please refer to our Circular IDMC.3810/11.08.10/2002-03 dated March 24, 2003 setting out 
uniform guidelines for accounting of repo/reverse repo transactions.  These guidelines 
captured the character of repo/reverse repo transaction as outright sale and outright 
purchase as per the legal position prevailing then.  The Reserve Bank of India 
(Amendment) Act, 2006 ( Act No. 26 of 2006) provides a legal definition of 'repo' and 
'reverse repo' ( vide sub-sections (c) and (d) of section 45 U of Chapter III D of the Act) as 
an instrument for borrowing ( lending) funds by selling ( purchasing) securities with an 
agreement to repurchase ( resell) the securities on a mutually agreed future date at an 
agreed price which includes interest for the funds borrowed( lent).  Accordingly, to bring 
such transactions to the balance sheet in their true economic sense and enhance 
transparency, the accounting guidelines have been reviewed and the revised guidelines are 
set out below:  
 
2. Market participants may undertake repos from any of the three categories of 
investments, viz., Held For Trading, Available For Sale and Held To Maturity.    
 
3. The economic essence of a repo transaction, viz., borrowing (lending) of funds by selling 
(purchasing) securities shall be reflected in the books of repo participants, by accounting 
the same as collateralized lending and borrowing transactions, with an agreement to 
repurchase, on the agreed terms.    Accordingly, the repo seller, i.e., borrower of funds in 
the first leg, shall not exclude the securities sold under repo but continue to carry the same 
in his investment account as a contra item (please see the illustration given in the Annex) 
reflecting his continued economic interest in the securities during the repo period.  On the 
other hand, the repo buyer, i.e., lender of funds in the first leg, shall not include the 
securities purchased under repo in his investment account but show it in a separate sub-
head (see the Annex).  The securities would, however, be transferred from the repo seller 
to repo buyer as in the case of normal outright/sale purchase transactions and such 
movement of securities shall be reflected using the Repo/Reverse Repo Accounts and  
contra entries.   In the case of repo seller, the Repo Account is credited in the first leg for 
the securities sold (funds received), while the same is reversed when the securities are 
repurchased in the second leg.  Similarly, in the case of repo buyer, the Reverse Repo 
Account is debited for the amount of securities purchased (funds lent) and the same is 
reversed in the second leg when the securities are sold back.   
 
4. The first leg of the repo transaction should be contracted at the prevailing market rates. 
The price for the second leg shall be so derived that the difference between the prices of 
first and second legs should reflect the repo interest.   
    
5. The accounting principles to be followed while accounting for repos / reverse repos are 
as under:  
 
 
(i) Coupon /Discount 
 
a.  The repo seller shall continue to accrue the coupon/discount on the securities sold 
under repo even during the repo period while the repo buyer shall not accrue the same.   
b.  In case the interest payment date of the security offered under repo falls within the repo 
period, the coupons received by the buyer of the security should be passed on to the seller 
of the security on the date of receipt as the cash consideration payable by the seller in the 
second leg does not include any intervening cash flows. 
 
(ii) Repo Interest Income / Expenditure 
 
After the second leg of the repo / reverse repo transaction is over,  
 
a.   the difference between consideration amounts of the first leg and second leg of the 
repo shall be reckoned as Repo Interest Income  / Expenditure in the books of the repo 
buyer / seller respectively ; and 
 
b.   the balance outstanding in the Repo Interest Income / Expenditure account should be 
transferred to the Profit and Loss account as an income or an expenditure . As regards 
repo / reverse repo transactions outstanding on the balance sheet date, only the accrued 
income / expenditure till the balance sheet date should be taken to the Profit and Loss 
account. Any repo income / expenditure for the remaining period should be reckoned for 
the next accounting period.  
 
 
(iii) Marking to Market 
The repo seller shall continue to mark to market the securities sold under repo transactions 
as per the investment classification of the security. To illustrate, for banks, in case the 
securities sold by them under repo transactions are out of the  Available for Sale category, 
then the mark to market valuation for such securities should be done at least once a 
quarter. For entities which do not follow any investment classification norms, the valuation 
for securities sold under repo transactions may be in accordance with the valuation norms 
followed by them in respect of securities of similar nature.  
6.  Disclosure 
 
The following disclosures should be made by banks in the “Notes on Accounts’ to the 
Balance Sheet:  
         (Rs. In crore)  
Maximum 
Minimum Daily Average 
outstanding Outstanding as 
 outstanding outstanding 
during the on March 31 
during the year during the year 
year 
Securities sold under     
repo  
Securities purchased     
under reverse repo  
 
7.   Treatment for Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) and Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR)  
The liabilities on account of repo borrowing should be included in the Net Demand and 
Time Liabilities (NDTL) for calculation of the CRR to be maintained.  However, repo 
borrowing from banks will be excluded on par with interbank borrowing, as hitherto.   
Considering the character of 'repo' as a sale/purchase of securities in terms of the RBI 
(Amendment) Act 2006, the securities acquired under a reverse repo transaction shall be 
reckoned for SLR, if they are approved securities for the purpose.  As such, the liabilities on 
account of repo borrowing may be excluded for calculation of the Demand and Time 
Liabilities (DTL) for the purpose of SLR.    
 
8.  Accounting Methodology 
The accounting methodology to be followed along with the illustrations are given in 
Annexes I and II. While market participants, having different accounting systems, may use 
accounting heads different from those used in the illustration, there should not be any 
deviation from the accounting principles enunciated above. Further, to obviate the disputes 
arising out of repo transactions, the participants may consider entering into bilateral Master 
Repo Agreement as per the documentation finalized by Fixed Income Money Market and 
Derivatives Association of India (FIMMDA). 
 
9.   Effective Date  
These accounting principles will be applicable from the financial year 2009-10.  
 
10.   Exclusion 
For the present, these norms would not apply to repo / reverse repo transactions conducted 
under the Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) with RBI. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 ANNEX - I  
 
Recommended Accounting Methodology for accounting of Repo / Reverse Repo 
transactions  
i The following accounts may be maintained , viz. i) Repo Account, ii) Reverse Repo 
Account, iii) Repo Interest Income Account,  iv) Repo Interest Expenditure Account v) 
Repo Interest Receivable Account and vi) Repo Interest Payable Account.  
 
ii In addition to the above, the following 'contra' accounts may also be maintained, viz. i) 
Securities Sold under Repo Account, (ii) Securities Purchased under Reverse Repo 
Account, (iii) Securities Receivable under Repo Account and (iv) Securities Deliverable 
under Reverse Repo Account.   
   
Repo 
 
iii In a repo transaction, the securities should be sold in the first leg at market related 
prices and re-purchased in the second leg at the derived prices. The sale and 
repurchase should be reflected in the Repo Account.  
iv Though the securities are not excluded from the repo seller's investment account and 
not included in the repo buyer's investment account, the transfer of securities shall be 
reflected by using the necessary contra entries.  
 
Reverse Repo 
 
v In a reverse repo transaction, the securities should be purchased in the first leg at 
prevailing market prices and sold in the second leg at the derived prices. The purchase 
and sale should be reflected in the Reverse Repo Account.   
vi The balances in the Reverse Repo Account shall not be a part of the  Investment 
Account for balance sheet purposes but can be reckoned for SLR purposes  if the 
securities acquired under reverse repo transactions are approved securities.   
 
Other aspects relating to Repo/Reverse Repo 
 
vii In case the interest payment date of the securities sold under repo falls within the repo 
period, the coupons received by the buyer of the security should be passed on to the 
seller on the date of receipt as the cash consideration payable by the seller in the 
second leg does not include any intervening cash flows.   
viii To reflect the accrual of interest in respect of the outstanding repo transactions at the 
end of the accounting period, appropriate entries should be passed in the Profit and 
Loss account to reflect Repo Interest Income / Expenditure in the books of the buyer / 
seller respectively and the same should be debited / credited as an income / 
expenditure payable/receivable. Such entries passed should be reversed on the first 
working day of the next accounting period.  
ix Repo seller continues to accrue coupon/discount as the case may be, even during the 
repo period while the repo buyer shall not accrue the same.

  ANNEX - II 
Illustrative examples for accounting of Repo / Reverse repo transactions (Encl. to 
RBI Circular on uniform guidelines for accounting of repo/reverse repo transactions) 
While in the body of the circular, the term "repo" is used generically to include both 
repo and reverse repo (which is simply a mirror image of a repo transaction), in this 
Annex the accounting guidelines have been set out separately for repo and reverse 
repo for clarity.
