Swap facility for providing Forex Liquidity  
to Indian Banks for their Overseas Branches/Subsidiaries  
 
In response to the unfolding events relating to the global turmoil and its impact on international 
money markets, central banks across the world have taken action to ease the liquidity 
situation through measures such as inter-central bank swap lines, collateralised lending and 
forex swaps.    
 
In the context of the global developments and in order to provide flexibility to Indian banks in 
managing their short-term funding requirements at their overseas offices, the Reserve Bank of 
India will provide forex liquidity to Indian public and private sector banks having foreign 
branches or subsidiaries, through forex swaps of tenors upto three months. This facility will be 
available on request until further notice. The pricing of swaps will be based on the interest 
rates in the domestic as well as the overseas markets using the Reserve Bank reference rate 
for the USD-INR exchange rate.  
 
Further, for funding the swaps, banks can also borrow under the Liquidity Adjustment Facility 
(LAF) for the corresponding tenor at the prevailing repo rate. The Reserve Bank of India will 
be prepared to consider any specific relaxation of Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) requirements 
for this purpose.  
 
Banks interested in availing of this facility are requested to approach the Chief General 
rd
Manager, Financial Markets Department, Reserve Bank of India, Central Office, 23 Floor, 
Fort, Mumbai – 400001 (Tel. nos. 22610642 / 22610650) for further details.
