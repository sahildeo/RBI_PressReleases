Governor’s Remarks on Inflation 
 
The following are the Governor’s remarks on inflation on the sidelines 
of the Fifth convocation function of National Institute of Bank Management 
(NIBM) held in Pune today. 
“There is a legitimate concern about the recent developments on the 
inflation front. I will mention five relevant factors. 
First, most of the latest hike in inflation is on account of oil prices, as 
has been explained in detail on Saturday by the Finance Secretary and the 
Chief Economic Advisor.  
Second, the hike on account of oil has come on top of some underlying 
inflationary pressures. 
Third, at the current level of global prices, the pass-through of oil prices 
is not happening on a continuous basis.  
Fourth, oil price increase is now a global problem, making inflation a 
problem for all countries, both developed and developing. Hence, our 
solutions to the problem will also be similar, but tailored to suit our conditions. 
Fifth, and finally, this high level of energy prices may not necessarily be 
temporary. So, the whole economy and indeed our society is better off 
adjusting to the possible new reality of high and volatile energy prices.  
In this specific context, RBI’s effort is to smoothen and enable this 
adjustment to a new reality so that inflation-expectations are contained. 
We, in the RBI, expected some pressure on prices due to pass-through 
of oil prices and have been taking pre-emptive measures in general, in view of 
lagged effects of such measures on the economy.  
In the light of new information on inflation on Friday, I had a detailed 
meeting with concerned professionals in the RBI on the same day to evaluate 
the emerging inflation scenario.  
I then called on the Finance Minister and the Prime Minister on 
Saturday, where we had detailed discussions.  
We will now have further internal assessment to consider our stance 
and measures in the light of the discussions I had with the Government on 
Saturday.  
We will also have consultations quickly with all concerned, including 
the Members of the Technical Advisory Committee on Monetary Policy.   2
We have ensured orderly conditions in the money, government 
securities and the foreign exchange markets on a continuous basis through 
our operations in these markets. 
The price pressures on account of oil are not entirely unanticipated, but 
they have been magnified in the WPI figures last Friday. To take a broader 
view, let me repeat what I said in the Annual Policy Statement on April 29, 
2008. 
At the same time, it is critical at this juncture to demonstrate on a 
continuing basis a determination to act decisively, effectively and 
swiftly to curb any signs of adverse developments in regard to inflation 
expectations. In view of the above unprecedented uncertainties and 
dilemmas, it is important to take informed judgments with regard to the 
timing and magnitude of policy actions; and such judgments need to 
have the benefit of evaluation of incoming information on a continuous 
basis. 
While announcing the policy in April 2008, we also announced a hike of 
25 basis points in the cash reserve ratio (CRR), on top of the hike of 50 basis 
points announced on April 17, 2008. Subsequent to the announcement of the 
oil price hike, we had announced a hike of 25 basis points in the repo rate, on 
June 11, 2008. 
We are approaching this issue in a calm and calculated fashion, and on 
an ongoing basis, in a timely manner. 
I would like to make some preliminary observations on our strengths 
and challenges in this context. 
The problem is such that we should look at it in terms of both the past 
and the future also.  
We had acted continuously and in a timely fashion to withdraw 
monetary accommodation since about four years ago.  
We have successfully moderated signs of overheating that emerged a 
couple of years ago.  
The government has taken supply side measures, as considered 
necessary.  
So, as mentioned in the Annual Policy Statement in April 2008, we now 
have, by and large, a good overall supply-demand position domestically. This 
is a source of strength in managing this unprecedented shock from global oil 
markets. 
Further, in view of the recent escalated price situation, we have taken 
actions April 2008 onwards, in terms of CRR and repo rates. We may have to 
build on the actions already taken. 
Now, let me look at the future. Of the three shocks from global 
economy, we are safe in regard to the financial sector and the outlook is 
optimistic on the food front. Therefore, as of now, fuel prices are the main, 
though a difficult, problem. The macro policy can, therefore, focus on this 
problem of fuel prices in the background of some strength in many other 
aspects.   3
We are confident that with a well-managed smooth adjustment of this 
episode, the inflation would be brought in alignment with our aim as 
expressed in the Policy from time to time. 
We must recognize that the oil shock has been externally imposed on 
India. We have to manage the shock and smoothly adjust to new realities, 
taking advantage of our strengths in the real sector also. 
Our financial and external sectors are strong, efficient and resilient to 
manage the adjustment process. 
In the process of difficult adjustment, the RBI will play its part in 
moderating and managing aggregate demand so that pressures on prices are 
not intensified. 
I call upon all market participants, in particular the financial market 
participants, to appreciate the problem with the analysis at their command, 
participate with us in managing demand and maintaining orderly conditions in 
financial markets, while drawing upon the strengths of their respective 
balance sheets.  
The RBI will continue to take determined and calibrated measures, as 
and when warranted, with a focus on managing expectations and on enabling 
adjustments in the economy in response to the oil shock.  
We are currently in the midst of intensive examination of issues and 
options”.
