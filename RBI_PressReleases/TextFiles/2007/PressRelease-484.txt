RBI’s Appeal to Public 
 The United Forum of Reserve Bank Officers and Employees has given a call to its 
members to apply for mass casual leave on Tuesday, October 21, 2008.  The Reserve 
Bank of India has stated that such action on their part amounts to cessation of work and 
concerted refusal to work. Apart from such action being uncalled for, in the absence of 
due notice, it amounts to an illegal strike.   
 
The Reserve Bank has also stated that the strike is likely to cause some disruption 
of normal work of the Reserve Bank on that day, including the payment and settlement 
system. While it will endeavor to maintain normal services, the Reserve Bank has advised 
members of public to complete their transactions, if any, with the Reserve Bank on 
October 20, 2008 itself.
