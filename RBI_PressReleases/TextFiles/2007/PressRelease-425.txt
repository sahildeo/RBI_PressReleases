Special Fixed Repo Rate under Liquidity Adjustment Facility 
The Reserve Bank of India shall conduct a special fixed rate term repo at 8 per cent 
per annum against eligible securities for Rs.11,050 crore on October 29, 2008, due for 
reversal on November 12, 2008, with a view to enabling banks to meet the liquidity 
requirements of mutual funds either on incremental or on rollover basis. 
It may be recalled that the Reserve Bank of India had announced earlier that it would 
conduct the special fixed rate term repo under Liquidity Adjustment Facility every day until 
further notice up to a cumulative amount of Rs 20,000 crore and that additional liquidity 
support to the extent of up to 0.5 per cent of their NDTL, can be availed by banks exclusively 
for the purpose of meeting requirements of mutual funds.  
Banks have utilised Rs.8950 crore of this facility till October 27, 2008.
