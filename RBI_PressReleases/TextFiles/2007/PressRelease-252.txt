Licence of Shree Vardhaman Co-operative Bank Ltd., Bhavnagar – Cancelled  
The Reserve Bank of India delivered the order cancelling the licence of the Shree 
Vardhaman Co-operative Bank Ltd., Bhavnagar after the close of business on November 
20, 2008.The bank had ceased to be solvent, all efforts to revive it in close consultation 
with the Government of Gujarat had failed and the depositors were being 
inconvenienced by continued uncertainty. The Registrar of Co-operative Societies, 
Gujarat has also been requested to issue an order for winding up the bank and appoint a 
liquidator for the bank.  It may be highlighted that on liquidation, every depositor is 
entitled to repayment of his/her deposits up to a monetary ceiling of Rs. 1,00,000/- 
(Rupees one lakh only) from the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation 
(DICGC) under usual terms and conditions.  
The bank was granted a licence by Reserve Bank  on September 29, 1986 to 
commence banking business.  The statutory inspection of the bank with reference to its 
position as on March 31, 2006 had indicated that its financial position was impaired.  
Subsequently, as the bank's financial position deteriorated further, it was issued 
directions under Section 35 A of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (As applicable to Co-
operative Societies) from the close of business of November 20, 2006 restricting its 
operations. 
The statutory inspection of the bank with reference to its position as on March 31, 
2007 revealed that its financial position was precarious. The Reserve Bank of India 
issued a show cause notice to the bank on August 11, 2008 asking it to show cause as 
to why the licence granted to it to conduct banking business should not be cancelled. 
The reply to the show cause notice was examined.  The bank did not have a viable plan 
of action for its revival. In the absence of any viable proposal to turn around and achieve 
the required regulatory prescriptions the possibility of revival of the bank was remote. 
Therefore, the Reserve Bank of India took the extreme measure of cancelling licence of 
the bank in the interest of the bank's depositors. With the cancellation of its licence and 
commencement of liquidation proceedings, the process of paying the depositors of 
Shree Vardhaman Co-operative Bank Ltd., Bhavnagar, Gujarat will be set in motion 
subject to the terms and conditions of the Deposit Insurance Scheme.   
Consequent to the cancellation of its licence, Shree Vardhaman Co-operative 
Bank Ltd., Bhavnagar, Gujarat is prohibited from carrying on ‘banking business’ as 
defined in Section 5(b) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (AACS) including 
acceptance and repayment of deposits.

General Manager, Urban Banks Department, Reserve Bank of India, Ahmedabad. His
