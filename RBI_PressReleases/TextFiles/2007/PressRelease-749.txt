RBI Clarification on phasing out of Banknotes 
On enquiries from the press and members of public, the Reserve Bank of 
India has clarified as follows:  
As a part of its currency management programme, the Reserve Bank 
phases out banknotes of old design once banknotes in new design with 
additional/enhanced security features are introduced. The Reserve Bank has 
asked banks that when they receive bank notes with old design in Rs.500 
denomination (1996 series), they may not re-issue such notes to public and 
instead return them to the Reserve Bank offices. Members of public will get the 
exchange value for the banknote of the old design tendered by them for the same 
value either in the new design of banknotes or by combination of other 
denominations or by credit to their account.  All banknotes in the 1996 design/ 
series will continue to be legal tender.  
All central banks undertake such exercise of phasing out banknotes in old 
designs to ensure that banknotes with enhanced security features are continued 
in circulation.  There is no time limit set for such phasing out or for members of 
public to exchange them.  
 The Reserve Bank of India also clarifies that at present it is not phasing 
out any currency notes in smaller denomination, that is, Rs.10, 20, 50 and 100.  
Members of public can continue to use all genuine banknotes which are 
legal tender.
