Introduction of Credit Derivatives in India : Review of Status 
It has been decided to keep in abeyance the issuance of the final guidelines 
on introduction of credit derivatives in India.  The decision has been taken so as to be 
able to draw upon the experience of the financial sector of some of the developed 
countries, particularly in the current circumstances, in which the entire dimensions of 
the recent credit market crisis have not yet been gauged. 
It may be recalled that the Reserve Bank of India had issued the ‘Draft 
Guidelines for Introduction of Credit Derivatives in India’, on March 26, 2003, inviting 
comments from banks and other stake holders. However, taking into account the 
status of the risk management practices then prevailing in the banking system, the 
issuance of final guidelines had been deferred.  
Subsequently, it was announced in the Annual Policy Statement for 2007-08 
(paragraph 175) that as a part of the gradual process of financial sector lilberalisation 
in India, it was considered appropriate to introduce credit derivatives in a calibrated 
manner.  Modified draft guidelines on Credit Default Swaps were, therefore, issued 
on May 16, 2007.  Based on the feedback received on draft guidelines, these were 
revised and a second draft of the guidelines was issued, on October 17, 2007, for 
another round of consultation.  
However, in view of certain adverse developments witnessed in different 
international financial markets, particularly the credit markets, resulting in 
considerable volatility in the recent past, such as mounting losses suffered by banks 
on account of sub-prime crisis, need for the central banks of those countries to inject 
liquidity into the system, as also the level of risk management systems and possible 
non-adherence to the regulatory guidelines on complex products such as credit 
derivatives, time is not considered opportune to introduce the credit derivatives in 
India, for the  present.
