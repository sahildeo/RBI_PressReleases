Special Market Operations                           
          
 Public sector oil companies are among the important participants in the 
money, foreign exchange, credit and bond markets. Consequently, liquidity and other 
related issues currently faced by these entities arising from the unprecedented 
escalation in international crude prices have systemic implications for the smooth 
functioning of financial markets and for overall financial stability.   It has, therefore, 
become necessary for the Reserve Bank of India to put in place Special Market 
Operations on an ad hoc basis so as to minimise potential adverse consequences 
for financial markets in a transparent manner.  Accordingly, it has been decided to  
 
• conduct open market operations (outright or repo at the discretion of the 
Reserve Bank) in the secondary market through designated banks in oil 
bonds held by public sector oil marketing companies in their own 
accounts subject to an overall ceiling of Rs.1,000 crore on any single day  
• provide equivalent foreign exchange through designated banks at market 
exchange rates to the oil companies.   
 
The Special Market Operations would constitute only a fraction of the total 
turnover in the money and foreign exchange markets but are intended to have the 
impact of reducing volatility.   Further, the Special Market Operations would improve 
the access of public sector oil companies to domestic liquidity and alleviate the 
lumpy demand in the foreign exchange market in the current extraordinary situation.  
 
 It may be recalled that on earlier occasions of market stress, the Reserve 
Bank had given assurances of domestic as well as foreign currency liquidity support 
to financial markets, including direct support to specific entities.   
 
 These measures are ad hoc, temporary in nature and will be reviewed on a 
continuous basis.
