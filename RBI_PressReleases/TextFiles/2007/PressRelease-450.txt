RBI Governor announces Mid-term Review of Annual Policy for 2008-09 
Dr.  D.  Subbarao, Governor, presented the Mid-term Review of Annual Policy for 
the Year 2008-09 today in a meeting with Chief Executives of major commercial banks. The 
Mid-term Review consists of two parts: Part A. Mid-term Review of the Annual Statement 
on Monetary Policy for the Year 2008-09; and Part B. Mid-term Review of the Annual 
Statement on Developmental and Regulatory Policies for the Year  2008-09. 
 
Highlights 
 
• Bank Rate, Repo Rate and Reverse Repo Rate kept unchanged. 
• The flexibility to conduct overnight repo or longer term repo including the right to accept or 
reject tender(s) under the LAF, wholly or partially, is retained. 
 
• CRR kept unchanged at 6.5 per cent. 
 
• GDP growth forecast for 2008-09 revised to a range of 7.5-8.0 per cent. 
 
• Keeping in view the supply management measures taken by the Government and the 
lagged demand response to the monetary policy measures taken by the Reserve Bank, it 
has been decided to maintain the earlier projection of inflation of 7.0 per cent by end-March 
2009 for policy purposes. 
 
• It will be the Reserve Bank’s endeavour to bring down inflation to a tolerable level of 
below 5 per cent at the earliest, while aiming for convergence with the global average 
inflation of around 3.0 per cent over the medium-term. 
 
• It is necessary to moderate the rate of money supply to 17 per cent in 2008-09. 
 • Based on the above overall assessment of the macroeconomic situation, the stance of 
monetary policy for the rest of 2008-09 will be as follows: 
• Ensure a monetary and interest rate environment that optimally balances the 
objectives of financial stability, price stability and well-anchored inflation 
expectations, and growth;  
• Continue with the policy of active demand management of liquidity through 
appropriate use of all instruments including the CRR, open market operations 
(OMO), the MSS and the LAF to maintain orderly conditions in financial markets; 
• In the context of the uncertain and unsettled global situation and its indirect impact 
on the domestic economy in general and the financial markets in particular, closely 
and continuously monitor the situation and respond swiftly and effectively to 
developments, employing both conventional and unconventional measures;  
• Emphasise credit quality and credit delivery, in particular, for employment-intensive

ago. 
 
• Money supply (M ) growth increased by 20.3 per cent on a year-on-year basis up to 
3
October 10, 2008, lower than 21.9 per cent a year ago but above the indicative projection 
of 17.0 per cent set out in the Annual Policy Statement of April 2008. 
 
• Aggregate deposits of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) increased by 21.6 per cent 
(Rs.6,15,263 crore) on a year-on-year basis up to October 10, 2008 as compared with 24.7 
per cent (Rs.5,65,124 crore) a year ago. 
 
• Credit extended by SCBs increased by 29.4 per cent (Rs.5,91,935 crore) on a year-on-
year basis up to October 10, 2008 as compared with an increase of 23.1 per cent 
(Rs.3,77,628 crore) a year ago. 
 • The year-on-year growth in total resource flow from SCBs to the commercial sector was 
28.9 per cent up to October 10, 2008 over and above the growth of 21.9 per cent a year 
ago. 
 
• Inclusive of LAF collateral securities on an outstanding basis, SCBs holdings of SLR 
securities amounted to Rs.10,72,416 crore or 28.2 per cent of net demand and time

scheme during the current year up to October 17, 2008. 
 
• Financial markets reflected the changes in liquidity conditions during the second quarter 
of 2008-09. The inter-bank money market has been working well throughout the period.  
 
 • During April-October 22, 2008 SCBs increased their deposit rates for various maturities 
by 50-175 basis points. 
 
• On the lending side, the benchmark prime lending rates (BPLRs) of PSBs increased by 
125-150 basis points in April-October to a range of 13.75-14.75 per cent by October 22, 
2008. 
 
• The private sector banks and foreign banks also increased their BPLR from the range of

10.00-17.00 per cent, respectively, during the same period. 
 
• Equity markets experienced a downturn in both the primary and secondary segments 
during the current financial year so far. In the secondary market, the BSE Sensex (1978-
79=100) was volatile with large two-way movements in response largely to movements in 
global equity markets. External Sector

previous year. 
 
• While non-POL imports decelerated to 28.3 per cent from 42.7 per cent a year ago, the 
surge in international crude oil prices resulted in POL imports increasing by 60.0 per cent 
as compared with 17.9 per cent in the corresponding period of the previous year. 
 
• The foreign exchange reserves declined by US $ 35.8 billion during the current financial 
year so far and stood at US $ 273.9 billion on October 17, 2008. 
 
•  During the current financial year so far, the rupee depreciated by 18.9 per cent against 
the US dollar, by 0.4 per cent against the euro, by 1.1 per cent against the pound sterling 
and by 19.1 per cent against the Japanese yen. 
 
Global Developments 
 
• During the first nine months of 2008, the slowdown in global growth spread across 
developed economies in an environment of heightened uncertainty. 
 
• Global economic prospects have been dampened by the weakening of the US economy, 
the wider repercussions of the ongoing financial market crisis and volatility in the energy, 
food and commodity prices. 
 
• According to the World Economic Outlook (WEO) of the IMF released in October 2008, 
global real GDP growth on a purchasing power parity basis is expected to decelerate from 
5.0 per cent in 2007 to 3.9 per cent in 2008 (4.1 per cent in WEO Update, July 2008) and 
further to 3.0 per cent in 2009 (3.9 per cent in WEO Update, July 2008).   
 
• In the US, real GDP growth slowed to 2.8 per cent in the second quarter of 2008 from 3.8 
per cent a year ago. . The October 2008 WEO of the IMF expects the US economy to slow 
from 2.0 per cent in 2007 to 1.6 per cent in 2008 and further to 0.1 per cent in 2009.  
 
• Globally, inflation has softened in several countries in recent months. There has been an 
overall decrease in prices of food, crude oil and metals since July 2008 which is 
contributing to the easing in consumer price inflation across the globe. • Strains in global financial markets have increased significantly in the third quarter of 2008. 
Equity markets have weakened significantly as valuations reflected disappointing earnings 
data in the financial and other cyclical sectors. Pressures in inter-bank money markets, 
which had persisted since May 2008, began to intensify further during the third quarter of 
2008. 
 
• For the resolution of various issues thrown up by the financial turmoil, the US Treasury 
and the Federal Reserve have adopted a multi-pronged approach of introducing and 
enhancing the effectiveness of liquidity facilities, allowing financial support, mergers, 
conversions and outright bankruptcies, affecting large investment and savings banks, and 
even a major insurance firm. 
 
• To ameliorate the strains in the money market consequent on these developments, in 
addition to the Term Auction Facility (TAF), Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF) and 
Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF) instituted earlier and enhanced subsequently, the 
Federal Reserve announced several initiatives to provide additional support to financial 
markets. 
 
• Contagion from the faltering US markets prompted co-ordinated emergency liquidity 
actions by major central banks on September 18, 2008 and the Bank of Canada, the Bank 
of England, the European Central Bank, the Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan and the 
Swiss National Bank announced co-ordinated measures designed to address the continued 
elevated pressures in US dollar short-term funding markets.   
 
• On September 25, 2008 money markets ground to a virtual halt and interbank and repo 
rates rose to almost record highs.  This prompted the US Treasury to announce a plan for a 
federal fund of US $ 700 billion to clear the bad debt overhang by (i) buying unviable paper 
to restore liquidity in markets; (ii) allowing orderly restructuring over time without distress 
sales; (iii) lessening foreclosures; and (iv) helping the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation (FDIC) in assisting troubled institutions, which was authorised by Congress in 
early October under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act.  
• On October 14, 2008 the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the US 
Department of the Treasury and the FDIC made a joint statement to protect the US 
economy, to strengthen public confidence in the financial institutions and to foster the 
robust functioning of the credit markets through a voluntary capital purchase programme 
and a temporary FDIC guarantee programme for a broad array of financial institutions. 
 
• A wave of banking contagion in Benelux, Germany, UK, Spain, Ireland and Iceland 
required government intervention late September onwards and some banks were taken into 
temporary state ownership.  
 
• Central banks have engaged in continuous close consultation and have co-operated in 
unprecedented joint actions. In addition to the US dollar swap lines, the Bank of Canada, 
the Bank of England, the European Central Bank, the Federal Reserve, the Sveriges 
Riksbank and the Swiss National Bank reduced their policy rates by 50 basis points on 
October 8, 2008. Also, the Bank of Japan expressed its strong support of these policy 
actions.  
 • In order to provide broad access to liquidity and funding to financial institutions, on 
October 13, 2008 the BoE, the ECB, Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan and the SNB 
jointly announced measures to improve liquidity in short-term US dollar funding markets. 
 
• Emerging market central banks have also responded in various ways to the events 
unfolding in the advanced economies. Monetary policy actions such as reducing required 
reserves and interest rates to boost liquidity have also been undertaken by some EMEs to 
stem the financial crisis. 
 
• Several central banks in Asia have cut their policy rates in tandem with the advanced 
economies and have provided assurances of liquidity support to financial markets. 
 
• Central banks of some countries such as Japan and Malaysia have not changed their 
policy rates in 2008.  
 
• Some central banks that have tightened their policy rates in recent months include Bank 
Indonesia; Bank of Thailand; the Banco Central de Chile, Banco Central do Brasil; and 
Banco de Mexico. 
 
Overall Assessment 
• Aggregate supply conditions in the Indian economy have shown resilience in the second 
quarter of 2008-09 in the face of a deteriorating global macroeconomic and financial 
environment. There are, however, growing indications that the underlying economic cycle is 
turning in tune with global economic developments and that domestic economic activity is 
straddling a point of inflexion.   
 
• Aggregate demand conditions continue to be mainly investment-driven, although some 
slackening which set in during the first quarter of 2008-09 appears to have become broad 
based. 
 
• Reflecting the aggregate demand pressures, key monetary and banking aggregates – 
money supply, deposit and non-food credit growth – have been expanding during the year 
so far at rates that are significantly elevated relative to indicative trajectories given in the 
Annual Policy Statement of April 2008. 
 
• The developments in monetary conditions resulted in a tightening of liquidity conditions in 
domestic financial markets through the second quarter of 2008-09. 
 
• Signs of deterioration in the fiscal situation appear to be adding to aggregate demand 
pressures in the economy. 
 
• Domestically, imported inflation pressures have been keeping headline inflation at 
elevated levels with considerable uncertainty as to where it will peak and when. 
 • Since the First Quarter Review of July 2008, global economic prospects have weakened 
further. The global economy is facing the deflationary effects of the financial crisis. There is 
increasing evidence that the US slowdown is spreading via the trade and financial 
channels. 
 
• The outlook for the emerging economies remains positive, but uncertainties about their 
resilience to the global shocks have increased. 
 
• The international financial system is gripped by extreme risk aversion in the wake of 
spectacular failures among the world's largest financial institutions, including several 
credited with history and tradition. 
 
• Conditions in global financial markets have worsened with the freezing of inter-bank 
markets in US and Europe necessitating massive liquidity injection facilities from central 
banks in these economies, reduction of policy rates, recapitalisation of troubled private 
banks by governments, coordinated action by European governments to bail out weak 
banks and guaranteeing of all deposits in the banking system in many countries. 
 
• In the overall assessment, global economic conditions have worsened and the future path 
of their evolution has turned highly uncertain. The broadening slowdown of economic 
activity in the advanced economies is beginning to impact the macroeconomic prospects of 
emerging economies, with those reliant on exports and on international financial markets 
for external financing needs likely to be the most vulnerable. Inflation remains elevated and 
a key risk to global economic prospects. 
 
Stance of Monetary Policy 
 
• This Mid-Term Review is set in the context of several complex and compelling policy 
challenges. There have been severe disruptions in international money markets, sharp 
declines in stock markets across the world and evidence of extreme risk aversion among 
financial sector participants. Governments, central banks and financial regulators around 
the world are responding to the crisis with aggressive, radical and unconventional 
measures to restore calm and confidence to the markets and bring them back to normalcy 
and stability. 
     
• India’s financial sector is stable and healthy. All indicators of financial strength such as 
capital adequacy, ratios of non-performing assets (NPA) and return on assets (RoA) for our 
commercial banks, which account for 88 per cent of banking assets, are robust. 
 
• Nevertheless, the global developments have had some indirect, knock-on effects on 
domestic financial markets. 
 
• In the wake of the stress on our financial markets as a result of the global financial crisis, 
the immediate challenge for the Reserve Bank was to infuse confidence by augmenting 
both domestic and foreign exchange liquidity. Accordingly, the Reserve Bank has taken a 
series of measures since mid-September, 2008  
• The measures taken since mid-September 2008 have substantially assuaged liquidity 
stress in domestic financial markets arising from the contagion of adverse external 
developments. 
 
• The task of monetary management has always centered around managing a judicious 
balance between price stability, sustaining the growth momentum and maintaining financial 
stability. The global financial turmoil, has, however, reinforced the importance of putting 
special emphasis on preserving financial stability. The current challenge, accordingly, is to 
strike an optimal balance between preserving financial stability, maintaining price stability, 
anchoring inflation expectations, and sustaining the growth momentum.  To manage this 
challenge, the Reserve Bank has deployed and will continue to deploy both conventional 
and unconventional tools.    
 
• Since the First Quarter Review of July 2008, there have been significant global and 
domestic developments which have rendered the outlook uncertain, and have increased 
the downside risks associated with this projection. Taking these developments and 
prospects into account, the Reserve Bank has revised the projection of overall real GDP 
growth for 2008-09 to a range of 7.5-8.0 per cent.  
 
• Keeping in view the supply management measures taken by the Government and the 
lagged demand response to the monetary policy measures taken by the Reserve Bank 
over the last one year, the earlier projection of inflation of 7.0 per cent by end-March 2009 
appears to be valid. It has, therefore, been decided to maintain this estimate for policy 
purposes. 
 
• It will be the Reserve Bank’s endeavour to bring down inflation to a tolerable level of 
below 5 per cent at the earliest, while aiming for convergence with the global average 
inflation of around 3.0 per cent over the medium-term. 
 
• Going forward, the Reserve Bank’s policy endeavour would be to modulate the monetary 
overhang generated by the sustained expansion of money supply since    2005-06. 
 
• The Reserve Bank will monitor the rate of credit growth and credit quality closely and will, 
as necessary, engage with select banks which are outliers on the norms.  
 
• The Reserve Bank will maintain a close vigil on the entire financial system to prevent 
pressures building up in the financial markets. This will include enhancing liquidity if 
pressures persist. This could also mean curtailing liquidity if the recent liquidity easing 
measures are seen to have injected excess liquidity, thereby stoking inflationary pressures.  
 
• The management of the global financial crisis has highlighted two important aspects.  
First, that resolution of a crisis of this magnitude and complexity demands going beyond the 
rule book to unconventional, unorthodox and swift policy actions.  Second, there is need for 
close coordination between the Government and the regulatory agencies without at the 
same time eroding institutional integrity and independence.  These aspects are important 
and relevant for India too.  
• The Reserve Bank has endeavoured to be proactive, and has taken measures to manage 
the rapid developments and ease pressures stemming from the global crisis.  In conclusion, 
the Reserve Bank reiterates that it is confident of managing the situation and minimising 
the adverse impact of the global crisis on the Indian economy.  Our financial system is 
strong and healthy, and our economic fundamentals are strong.  Once the global situation 
is managed and calm and confidence are restored, we will return to our higher growth 
trajectory.  
 
• Based on the above overall assessment of the macroeconomic situation, the stance of 
monetary policy for the rest of 2008-09 will be as follows: 
• Ensure a monetary and interest rate environment that optimally balances the 
objectives of financial stability, price stability and well-anchored inflation 
expectations, and growth;  
• Continue with the policy of active demand management of liquidity through 
appropriate use of all instruments including the CRR, open market operations 
(OMO), the MSS and the LAF to maintain orderly conditions in financial markets; 
• In the context of the uncertain and unsettled global situation and its indirect impact 
on the domestic economy in general and the financial markets in particular, closely 
and continuously monitor the situation and respond swiftly and effectively to 
developments, employing both conventional and unconventional measures;  
• Emphasise credit quality and credit delivery, in particular, for employment-intensive 
sectors, while pursuing financial inclusion.  
 
Monetary Measures 
• The Bank Rate has been kept unchanged at 6.0 per cent. 
 
• The repo rate under the LAF is kept unchanged at 8.0 per cent. 
 
• The reverse repo rate under the LAF is kept unchanged at 6.0 per cent. 
 
• The Reserve Bank has the flexibility to conduct repo/reverse repo auctions at a fixed rate 
or at variable rates as circumstances warrant. 
 
• The Reserve Bank retains the option to conduct overnight or longer term repo/reverse 
repo under the LAF depending on market conditions and other relevant factors. The 
Reserve Bank will continue to use this flexibility including the right to accept or reject 
tender(s) under the LAF, wholly or partially, if deemed fit, so as to make efficient use of the 
LAF in daily liquidity management. 
 
• The cash reserve ratio (CRR) kept unchanged at 6.5 per cent. Developmental and Regulatory Policies 
Interest rate Policy  
• Interest rate ceilings on FCNR(B) and NR(E)RA deposits were increased by 50 
basis points each, i.e., to Libor/Swap rates minus 25 basis points and to Libor/Swap 
rates plus 50 basis points, respectively effective from the close of business on 
September 16, 2008.   
• These ceilings were increased further by 50 basis point each, i.e., to Libor/Swap 
rates plus 25 basis points and Libor/Swap rates plus 100 basis points, respectively, 
effective from the close of business on October 15, 2008. 
Financial Markets 
• The Reserve Bank announced special market operations (SMO) on May 30, 2008 
on an ad hoc basis which were conducted through designated banks in oil bonds 
held by public sector oil marketing companies. The SMO was terminated effective 
from August 8, 2008, but taking into account the continuing uncertain global 
situation and the potentially adverse implications for domestic financial markets, the 
Reserve Bank announced on October 15, 2008 that it has decided to reinstitute a 
similar facility when oil bonds become available. 
• For fine-tuning the management of bank reserves on the last day of the
