RBI releases Final Report of the Internal Working Group  
on Currency Futures  
 
The Reserve Bank of India has today released the Report of the Internal 
Working group on Currency Futures. In the context of the need for greater 
flexibility for hedging exchange rate risk, an Internal Working Group had been set 
up, following an announcement in the Annual Policy Statement for the year 2007-
08, to suggest a suitable framework to operationalise the proposal to introduce 
currency futures in line with the current legal and regulatory framework. The draft 
Report of the Working Group was placed on the website on November 16, 2007 
for public comments. The views and comments received from a cross section of 
public, banks, market participants, academicians and Government of India were 
presented to the Technical Advisory Committee on Money, Foreign Exchange 
and Government Securities Markets (TAC). Taking into account the feedback 
received from the public and expert views of the TAC, the Report has been 
suitably revised and has been released today. The report is available on RBI 
website at www.rbi.org.in.
