Report on Currency and Finance - 1995-96 
 
The Report on Currency and Finance brought out by the staff of the Reserve Bank of India is a reference document 
containing comprehensive coverage of the developments during the fiscal year 1995-96. The timing of the report is 
determined by the availability of firm data on all economic variables including national income. Volume I of the Report 
presents an economic review while volume II contains statistical statements.  
Volume I contains, in all, 11 chapters. Chapter I reviews in brief the developments during the fiscal year 1995-96 and 
covers in a nutshell the emerging economic scenario during the fiscal year 1996-97 so far. Chapters II, III and IV deal with 
real sector developments relating to national income, agricultural production and industrial performance. Chapter V covers 
monetary and banking developments. Chapter VI deals with developments in the financial markets while chapter VII gives 
an account of policy developments and price trends in commodity and bullion market. In chapter VIII fiscal developments 
are reviewed. The developments in foreign trade, balance of payments and international finance are covered in chapters IX 
and X. Chapter XI provides a synoptic view of major developments in the States and Union Territories.  
The major highlights of the economic developments during 1995-96 were the continued high real GDP growth of 7.1 per 
cent and the decline in the inflation rate to a single digit level. While the agricultural output suffered a setback, registering a 
negative growth rate of 0.4 per cent, the industrial sector put up an impressive performance with a record growth of 11.6 per 
cent. The fiscal scenario was one of continued strain on the Centre's finances as reflected in the substantial increase in 
various deficit indicators.  
Monetary expansion (M3) was substantially lower at 13.2 per cent. There was a deceleration in growth rate of aggregate 
deposits and bank credit of scheduled commercial banks to 12.1 per cent and 20.1 per cent respectively. The decline in the 
inflation rate to 5.0 per cent on a point-to-point basis, during the year was sharp, particularly so in the context of the double 
digit inflation recorded in the previous two years. The external sector developments were marked by robust export 
performance for the third year in succession with a growth rate of 20.9 per cent while the growth in imports, on BOP basis, 
was also higher at 30.1 per cent. The foreign currency assets of the Reserve Bank as at end-March 1996 stood at a little 
over US$17 billion, equivalent to about five months of imports.  
As regards the economic developments during the fiscal year 1996-97 so far, the production of foodgrains is expected to be 
higher at 191.2 million tonnes during 1996-97. Industrial production during the first half of the current financial year (April-
September 1996) registered a lower growth of 9.8 per cent. The budget deficit and monetised deficit have remained high at 
Rs.13,755 crore and at Rs.6,020 crore respectively as on January 24, 1997. The monetary expansion M3 has been higher 
during the current financial year so far (up to January 17, 1997) at 10.6 per cent.  
During the current financial year (up to January 17, 1997) aggregate deposits of scheduled commercial banks increased 
substantially by Rs.41,726 crore or 9.6 per cent while bank credit expanded by Rs.11,511 crore. The inflation rate was 
placed at 7.0 per cent, on a point-to-point basis, since the beginning of the current financial year (up to January 18, 1997). 
The external sector developments have been characterised by low export growth and exports in dollar terms rose by only 
6.4 per cent during the first nine months of the current financial year (April-December 1996) while import growth slackened 
to 4.4 per cent. Balance of payments developments so far during 1996-97 (April-November 1996), continue to reflect signs 
of sustainability in the external sector. India's foreign exchange reserves stood at US$ 23,973 million as on January 31, 
1997. The exchange rate of the rupee remained broadly stable during the first nine months of the current financial year 
(April-December 1996) moving within the range of Rs.34.14 per U.S. dollar and Rs.35.94 per U.S. dollar in terms of FEDAI 
indicative rates. The prospects for the financial year 1996-97 as a whole appear to be favourale. Fairly good rainfall in most 
regions of the country has brightened the prospects of a much higher level of agricultural production this year. Further, 
improvement in the reservoir levels augurs well for a step-up in hydel power generation. With regard to industrial 
production, while manufacturing sector and capital goods segment in particular have recorded an impressive performance, 
there is a slow down in terms of overall growth. Nevertheless, these factors point to the feasibility of the real GDP growth 
during 1996-97 to be around 6.8 per cent as forecast by the CSO.   
The external payments situation remains under control. The current account deficit is expected to be lower than 2 per cent 
of GDP as was originally envisaged. The foreign currency assets of the RBI remain comfortable at around US$ 19.8 billion 
now. Economic developments during 1996-97 have, however, raised certain concerns. These relate to industrial growth, 
interest rates and export growth. For economic growth to be sustained at a rate of 7.0 per cent, there is an imperative need 
to raise further the saving rate even though the latest national income data do show a pick up in the saving rate. A better 
alignment between desired investment rate and domestic saving rate as well as maintenance of inflation rate at a 
reasonably low level will help to bring down the interest rate in a sustained way.
