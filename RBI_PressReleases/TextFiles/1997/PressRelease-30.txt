Nominated Agencies can sell imported Gold/Silver in domestic market 
 
Following the recent changes in the Gold Policy announced by the Government of India, the seven banks which 
were earlier authorised by the Reserve Bank of India to import gold and silver for sale to exporters, Special 
Import License (SIL) holders and returning non-resident Indians, have now been authorised to import gold and 
silver for sale in the domestic market as well, without a licence or without surrender of SIL. The banks are: Bank 
of India, Canara Bank, Indian Overseas Bank, Allahabad Bank, Bank of Nova Scortia, Standard Chartered Bank 
and ABN Amro Bank. The duty for such imports may be paid in rupees at the rate of Rs. 220 per ten grams of 
gold and Rs. 500 per kg. of silver.  
Payment of duty under the SIL window which was hitherto required to be made from the Exchange Earners' 
Foreign Currency (EEFC) Accounts, will now be accepted in Indian rupees.
