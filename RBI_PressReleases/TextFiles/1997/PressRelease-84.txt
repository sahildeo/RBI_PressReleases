Portfolio Investment by Foreign Investors - Purchase up to 30 per cent 
Apropos the Government of India raising the ceiling for portfolio investment for foreign 
investors in Indian companies from 24 per cent to 30 per cent, the Reserve Bank of India 
has allowed purchase of equity shares and convertible debentures of Infosys 
Technologies Limited up to 30% of its paid up capital.  
It may be recalled that the Government of India by its press release No.14/11/96-NRI 
dated April 4, 1997 raised the portfolio investment ceiling for all foreign institutional 
investors (FIIs)/non-residents of Indian nationality/origin (NRIs) and overseas corporate 
bodies predominantly owned by such persons (OCBs) in Indian companies from 24 per 
cent to 30 per cent of their issued and paid-up capital. This is subject to the approval by 
the board of directors of the concerned company and a special resolution passed by the 
general body of that company.  
The Reserve Bank of India monitors the foreign investments in companies on a daily 
basis. For effective monitoring of the foreign investment ceiling limits in Indian 
companies, the Re serve Bank alerts all the designated bank branches at a cut-off point 
limit lower than the ceiling limit after which the desig nated bank branches are required 
to obtain the Reserve Bank of India's prior clearance before purchasing further shares 
on behalf of their FII/NRI/OCB clients. Once foreign investments in a company reach the 
alert limit, the Reserve Bank gives clearance on a first-cum-first-served basis till the 
ceiling limit is reached. While the alert limit is 20 per cent for ceiling limits of 24 per cent 
foreign investments, the alert limit is 26 per cent for the revised foreign investment limit 
of 30 per cent.  
The present investment limits for an individual FII, NRI or OCB remain unaltered. That is, 
investment made on repatriation basis by any single NRI/OCB in equity shares and 
convertible debentures should not exceed one per cent of the total paid-up equity capital 
of the company or one per cent of total paid up value of each series of convertible 
debentures issued by the company. The purchase of equity shares by a single FII/SEBI 
approved sub-account of a registered FII in the company should not exceed 10 per cent 
of the paid-up equity capital of the company. For this purpose, the holdings of the FII 
group to which the applicant belongs are counted as the holdings of a single FII.  Companies in which Foreign Investment up to 30 per cent is allowed  
1. Infosys Technologies Limited  
2. Mastek Ltd.  
Companies in which 24 per cent limit has been reached and no fresh purchases 
are allowed

The Reserve Bank has, on June 14, 1997, allowed Infosys Technologies Ltd., which had 
earlier reached the limit of 24 per cent, to raise the aggregate limit to 30 per cent.  
Companies in which 20 per cent limit has been reached and require prior RBI 
clearance for further purchases  
1. Essel Packaging Ltd.  
2. State Bank of India  
3. Carrier Aircon Ltd.

of India while approving their GDR issue.
