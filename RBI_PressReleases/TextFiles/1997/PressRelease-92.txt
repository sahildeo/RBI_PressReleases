Banking Ombudsman for the States of West Bengal and Sikkim 
The Reserve Bank of India has appointed Shri S.L.Bose, IAS (Retd.), formerly Member,

It may be recalled that the Banking Ombudsman Scheme, 1995 was introduced by the

commercial banks having business in India, except regional rural banks.  
The scheme seeks to establish a system of Banking Ombudsman for the expeditious 
and inexpensive resolution of customer complaints. Any person whose grievance 
against a bank is not resolved to his satisfaction by that bank within a period of two 
months after the bank received the complaint can approach the Banking Ombudsman if 
his complaint pertains to any of the matters specified in the scheme.  
The Banking Ombudsman will have authority to look into complaints concerning -  
a. deficiency in service such as, non-payment/inordinate delay in the payment or 
collection of cheques, drafts/bills, etc.; non-acceptance of small denomination 
notes tendered for any purpose without sufficient cause and charging of 
commission for handling of such notes; non-issue of drafts to customers and 
others; non-adherence to prescribed working hours by branches; failure to 
honour guarantee/letter of credit commitments by banks; claims in respect of 
unauthorised or fraudulent with drawals from deposit accounts, etc.; complaints 
pertaining to the operations in any savings, current or any other account main 
tained with a bank, such as delays, non-credit of proceeds to parties' accounts, 
non-payment of deposit or non-observance of the Reserve Bank directives, if 
any, applicable to rate of interest on deposits; complaints from exporters in India 
such as delays in receipt of export proceeds, handling of export bills, collection of 
bills, etc., provided the said complaints pertain to the bank's operations in India; 
and complaints from Non-Resident Indians having accounts in India in relation to 
their remittances from abroad, deposits and other bank-related matters.  
 
 b. loans and advances insofar as they relate to non-ob servance of Reserve Bank
