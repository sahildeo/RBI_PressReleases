RBI decentralises grant of automatic approval 
The Reserve Bank of India has decided to decentralise, to its regional offices, the work 
relating to grant of approval for foreign technical collaboration proposals. The proposals 
falling under the automatic route involve lump sum payment up to US$ 2 million, royalty - 
five per cent on domestic sales and eight per cent on exports - for a period of seven 
years from the date of commencement of commercial production or 10 years from the 
date of agreement, whichever is earlier. The decision to decentralise the work has been 
taken in view of the good response from trade and industry for the automatic route of the 
Reserve Bank and to extend easy accessibility to the applicants.  
So far, in accordance with the liberalisation measures announced by the Government of 
India, applications for approval of foreign collaborations were being entertained by the 
Central Office of the Reserve Bank of India, Mumbai.  
With effect from April 21, 1997, applications under the automatic route for technology 
transfer should be lodged with the concerned regional office of the Exchange Control 
Department of the Reserve Bank, in the prescribed new form, viz., FT (RBI). 
Applications under the automatic route for foreign investment or composite applications 
for foreign investment and technology transfer will, however, continue to be entertained 
at the Central Office of the Reserve Bank, Mumbai in the revised form FC (RBI).  
The new form FT(RBI)/revised form FC(RBI) will be available at the Sales Section, 
Department of Economic Analysis & Policy, Reserve Bank of India, Amar Building 
(Ground Floor), Fort, Mumbai-400 001 as also with the regional offices of the Exchange 
Control Department, Reserve Bank of India. Detailed guidelines will also be available 
with the application forms.
