Nov 11,1997 
Portfolio Investment by FIIs/NRIs and OCBs 
Infosys Technologies Ltd.  
The Reserve Bank of India has withdrawn the restrictions on further purchase of shares 
of Infosys Technologies Ltd., Bangalore on behalf foreign institutional investors (FIIs)/ 
non-residents of Indian nationality/origin (NRIs) and overseas corporate bodies owned to 
the extent of at least 60 per cent by such persons (OCBs) under the portfolio investment 
scheme. The restrictions which were placed in October 1997 have been withdrawn as 
the percentage of investments by FIIs/NRIs/OCBs to the paid up equity capital of the 
company has come down below 30 per cent. However, as the percentage of 
investments of FIIs/NRIs/OCBs in the company has reached 26 per cent of its paid up 
capital, further purchases of equity shares of the company on behalf of FIIs/NRIs/OCBs 
will be allowed only after obtaining the prior clearance from the Reserve Bank of India.  
Satyam Computer Services Ltd.  
The Reserve Bank of India has also permitted purchase of equity shares and convertible 
debentures of Satyam Computer Services Ltd. under the portfolio investment scheme 
on behalf of FIIs/NRIs/OCBs subject to certain conditions. This follows passing of a 
resolution by the company agreeing for the purchase of its equity shares and convertible 
debentures by FIIs/NRIs/OCBs up to 30 per cent of its issued and paid up capital 
through stock exchanges under the portfolio investment scheme. This was done in 
accordance with Government of India's press release No.14/11/96-NRI dated April 4, 
1997 raising the portfolio investment ceiling for all FIIs/NRIs/OCBs in Indian companies 
from 24 per cent to 30 per cent of their issued and paid-up capital. In May 1996 the 
Reserve Bank had prohibited purchase of equity shares of this company on behalf of 
FIIs/NRIs/OCBs from the secondary market, as the then overall ceiling of 24 per cent of 
its issued and paid up capital had been reached.
