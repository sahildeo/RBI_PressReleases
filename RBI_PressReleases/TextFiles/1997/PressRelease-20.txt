Recent Developments in Financial Markets: RBI announces Package of Measures 
 
In response to recent developments in the financial markets, especially foreign 
exchange markets, the Reserve Bank of India has today announced a package of 
measures. The measures include deferment of the future programme for bringing about 
a reduction in cash reserve ratio by a little over a month and a fixed rate repos for 
achieving more manoeuvrability in short term liquidity management. The Reserve Bank 
has also decided that the recently announced increase in the interest rate for post 
shipment export credit will soon be effective from the date of advance. It has also 
decided to monitor the cancellation of forward contracts by corporates. The details of 
measures announced are :  
Deferment of CRR Reduction  
Taking into account the present overall liquidity position and the developments in the 
financial markets, in particular the possible spill-over effects on the foreign exchange 
markets, the Reserve Bank has decided to defer the envisaged reductions in Cash 
Reserve Ratio (CRR) of scheduled commercial banks (other than regional rural banks). 
As against the next reduction sched- uled to take place from the fortnight beginning 
December 20, 1997, the new schedule of phased reductions begins from the fortnight 
beginning January 31, 1998 and ends with the fortnight beginning April 11, 1998.  
It may be recalled that the monetary and credit policy measures for the second half of 
1997-98 had envisaged reduction of CRR in eight phases of a quarter percent each 
beginning Octo- ber 25, 1997. It was envisaged to reduce CRR to 8.00 per cent by the 
end of March 1998. At present, the CRR is 9.50 per cent.  
Fixed Rate Repos  
The Reserve Bank of India has also announced a scheme of Fixed Rate Repos 
commencing November 29, 1997. The scheme facil- itates absorption of surplus liquidity 
in a more flexible way from the system by the Reserve Bank of India from time to time at 
such volumes as may be necessary to bring about orderly condi- tions in both money 
and forex markets.  
It may be noted that in view of the integration of money market and the foreign exchange 
market, the conditions in the domestic money market have a significant bearing on foreign exchange transactions. In this context, it has become necessary to achieve 
greater manoeuverability in short term liquidity man- agement in the system.  
It may be recalled that in the repo auction conducted on November 27, 1997 the repo 
rate was fixed at 4.50 per cent.  
Interest Rate on Post Shipment  
Rupee Export Credit  
It has been decided that with effect from December 15, 1997, the interest rate of 15 per 
cent per annum would be applicable from the date of advance. Exporters are expected 
to take advan- tage of the time gap available upto December 15 by expediting realisation 
of their export proceeds.  
It may be recalled that the interest rate on post shipment rupee export credit on usance 
bills for total period (comprising usance period of export bills transit period as specified 
by Foreign Exchange Dealers' Association of India and grace period wherever 
applicable) beyond 90 days and upto six months from the date of shipment was 
increased to 15.0 per cent per annum on November 26, 1997. It was also indicated that 
this rate would be applicable only for the period beyond 90 days, and not from the date 
of advance.  
Cancellations of Forward Contracts  
It has been decided to reintroduce the system of monitoring the cancellations of forward 
contracts beyond US $ 500,000. Information on such cancellations from November 1, 
1997 is imme- diately being called for from the banks. The recent scrutiny of banks by 
the Reserve Bank inspectors has revealed that of late, there has been a spurt in 
cancellations and rebooking of forward contracts. The Reserve Bank is closely 
monitoring the situation and will take appropriate action wherever warranted.
