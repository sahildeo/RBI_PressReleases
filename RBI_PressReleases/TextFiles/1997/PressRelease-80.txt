NRI / OCB Investment in sick Industrial units 
In order to encourage investment by NRIs/OCBs under the sick unit scheme and also to 
further simplify the norms prescribed under the scheme, it has been decided to permit 
NRIs/OCBs to invest up to 100 per cent of equity capital of a sick company either by 
purchase of equity shares from the existing shareholders or in the form of subscription to 
the new equity issue of the sick company subject to the condition that the company is 
declared as sick or a rehabilitation programme has been approved by a public financial 
institution/commercial bank/consortium of banks or by the Board for Industrial and 
Financial Reconstruction (BIFR). There will be no lock-in period for repatriation of 
capital.  
Under the existing provisions, NRIs/OCBs are permitted to undertake revival of sick 
industrial units by making bulk invest ment in them either by way of purchase of equity 
shares from existing shareholders or in the form of subscription to new equity issues of 
the sick units subject to certain terms and conditions.
