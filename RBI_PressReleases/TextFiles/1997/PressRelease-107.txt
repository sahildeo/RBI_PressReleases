Fresh Agreement on Reserve Bank of India support to Government of India 
As per the Agreement signed between the Reserve Bank of India and Government of India on September 9, 1994, the 
system of ad-hoc Treasury Bills is to be discontinued by 1997-98. The Budget for 1997-98 has announced the decision to 
introduce a new system upon the discontinuation of the ad-hoc Treasury Bills from the financial year 1997-98.  
Consequently, the Reserve Bank of India and Government of India propose to enter into a fresh Agreement to give effect to 
the new system.  
The details of the proposed system are:  
• The system of ad hoc Treasury Bills to finance budget deficit will be discontinued with effect from April 1, 1997.  
• A scheme of Ways and Means Advances (WMA) by Reserve Bank of India to Government of India (GOI) will be 
introduced to accommo date temporary mismatches in Government receipts and payments. The limit for WMA and the 
rate of interest on WMA will be mutual ly agreed between RBI and Government from time to time.  
• Any drawals by Government from Reserve Bank of India in excess of the limit of WMA would be permissible only for 
ten consecutive working days. When 75 per cent of WMA is utilised, the Reserve Bank would trigger fresh floatation of 
Government Securities.  
• Consistent with the discontinuance of Ad hoc Treasury Bills, the system of 91 Days Tap Treasury Bills will also be 
discontin ued with effect from April 1, 1997.  
• The change over to the new system requires sophisticated system of cash management by the Government which may 
require Government's discussions with select Ministries like Railways and Defence. Also certain improvements in the 
debt management system are necessary. Therefore, a transition period of two years is envisaged. During the transition, 
the period of overdraft may exceed ten consecutive working days; but a higher interest rate would be applied on the 
overdraft amounts for the period exceed ing ten consecutive working days.  
• With the discontinuance of ad hoc Treasury Bills and Tap Treasury Bills and the introduction of WMA, the concept of 
con ventional Budget Deficit as defined so far loses its relevance. Therefore, the practice of showing Budgetary Deficit 
has been discontinued instead gross fiscal deficit has become the key indicator of deficit. As a transparent way of 
reporting the monetised deficit, the likely extent of RBI support in respect of dated securities and auction Treasury Bills 
is being separately shown as the 'Monetised Deficit' in the Budget document. The actual monetised deficit at the close 
of the year may, however, be different from the Reserve Bank support indicated ex ante in the Budget depending upon 
market conditions and the open market operations of the Reserve Bank.  
The new system while ensuring fiscal discipline estab lishes a reasonable mechanism of financing the day to day re 
quirements of Government of India. The fresh agreement will provide greater autonomy to the Reserve Bank in formulating 
and implementing monetary policy.  
 
The system of issuing ad hoc Treasury Bills to finance automatically budget deficits has been in vogue since 1954-55. It 
was initiated as an administrative arrangement between the Cen tral Government and the Reserve Bank so that the Central 
Govern ment's cash balance should be maintained at a minimum level of Rs.50 crore on Fridays and Rs.4 crore on other 
days. To adhere to this arrangement, it had become necessary to ensure that the account replenished whenever the actual 
balances were below the Rs.50 crore/Rs.4 crore level, by creation of ad hoc Treasury Bills in favour of the Reserve Bank. 
The system resulted in direct monetisation of budget deficits and contributed to rapid monetary expansion in past years.   
An agreement was signed between RBI and the Central Government on September 9, 1994 to phase out the system of ad 
hoc Treasury Bills over a period of three years. It was agreed that the net issue of ad hoc Treasury Bills at the end of the 
year 1994-95 was not to exceed Rs.6,000 crore and that, if the net issue of ad hoc Treasury Bills exceeded Rs.9,000 crore 
for more than ten consecutive working days at any time during the year, the Reserve Bank would automatically reduce the 
level of ad hoc Treasury Bills by auctioning Treasury Bills or selling fresh Government of India dated securities in the 
market. Subsequently, similar ceilings for the net issue of ad hoc Treasury Bills were stipulated for 1995-96 and 1996-97.  
 
While in 1994-95 the agreement was strictly adhered to both in terms of year end level of ad hoc treasury bills as well as 
the intra year limit, in 1995-96 there were prolonged periods in which intra year limit was exceeded. During 1996-97 since 
August 14, 1996 the net issue of ad hocs has remained below within the year limit.  
 
At the time of presentation of the Budget for 1996-97 the Finance Minister had indicated that he would present concrete 
proposals for phasing out the system of ad hoc treasury bills in the Budget for 1997-98.
