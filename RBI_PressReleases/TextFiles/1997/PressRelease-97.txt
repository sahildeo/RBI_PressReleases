RBI simplifies procedure for issue and export  of shares  by Indian companies 
Indian companies will no longer have to approach the Reserve Bank of India twice for 
seeking permission for issue and export of shares to non-resident Indian (NRI) investors. 
The Reserve Bank has decided to grant such permissions to eligible companies in one 
stage in order to expedite the process of issue and export of shares to NRI investors as 
also to simplify the existing procedure.  
Earlier, under the various schemes for NRI investments in Indian companies, the 
Reserve Bank used to grant permission to eligible companies for issue of shares to NRI 
investors in two stages. In the first stage, after establishing the eligibility of the applicant 
Indian company, the Reserve Bank granted `in-principle' approval. The final approval to 
issue and export share certificates to NRI investors was granted in the second stage 
after the company submitted the list of investors, foreign inward remittance 
certificates/bank certificates, etc., evidencing receipt of funds from abroad.  
The Reserve Bank has stated that after obtaining the one-stage RBI approval but before 
issuing and exporting the shares to NRI investors, Indian companies should ensure 
receipt of funds in foreign exchange by way of inward remittances or by debit to the non-
resident(external)(NRE)/foreign currency non-resident (FCNR) accounts of the investors 
as also obtain the necessary documentary evidence by way of foreign inward remittance 
certificates/bank certificates from the concerned banks. The Reserve Bank has also 
stated that the issuer company should immediately report to the Reserve Bank along 
with a certificate by the authorised dealers that the remittances have been received.
