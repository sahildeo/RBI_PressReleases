RBI Clarification on Exchange Rate 
The Economic Times issue of August 20, 1997 in a front page article attributes to the Prime 
Minister the view that the Government would shortly fix a band to signal the exchange rate of the 
rupee in relation to the US dollar. This report is misleading. It is clarified that while the Committee 
on Capital Account Convertibility had recommended a band in relation to a neutral real effective 
exchange rate, no decision in this regard has been taken by the Government and the RBI. While 
the exchange rate will continue to be determined by market forces, it is recognised that the 
exchange rate management will have to balance the needs of the exporters to have a favourable 
exchange rate and the need to prevent monetary expansion from going beyond what is 
considered appropriate for maintaining price stability.
