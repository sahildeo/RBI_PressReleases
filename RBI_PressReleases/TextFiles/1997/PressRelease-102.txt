Scheme for sale of 14 Day Intermediate Treasury Bills FOR State Governments, Foreign Central Banks and other 
specified     bodies for Investment of their temporary Surplus Funds 
Hitherto, State Governments, as also a few foreign Central banks and special bodies have been investing their surplus cash 
in 91 day Tap Bills as per the agreements with the Bank. Following the Finance Minister's announcement in the budget for 
1997-98 and the Agreement signed between the Reserve Bank of India and Government of India on March 26, 1997, the 
91 day Tap Treasury Bills will be discontinued with effect from April 1, 1997. In order to provide them with an alternate 
arrangement in place of 91 day Tap Treasury Bills for investment of their temporary cash surpluses effective April 1, 1997, 
the Government of India has introduced the Scheme of 14 day Intermediate Treasury Bills. 14 day Intermediate Treasury 
Bills will be sold by Reserve Bank of India, Public Accounts Department, Nagpur/Mumbai/New Delhi/Calcutta.  
The salient features of the Scheme are :  
Eligibility for Investment 
The Bills will be sold only to State Governments, foreign central banks and other specified bodies with whom the Reserve 
Bank of India has an agreement, by way of investing their temporary surplus funds. No other person will be eligible to invest 
in the 14 day Intermediate Treasury Bills.  
 
Minimum Investment 
The 14 day Intermediate Treasury Bills would be sold for a minimum amount of Rs.1,00,000/- and in multiples of 
Rs.1,00,000/-.  
 
Form 
The 14 day Intermediate Treasury Bills will be issued only in book-entry form i.e., by credit to Subsidiary General Ledger 
Account.  
 
Transferability 
The 14 day Intermediate Treasury Bills are not transferable.  
 
Repayment 
The Bills will be repaid/renewed at par on the expiration of 14 days from the date of their issue.  
 
Discount Rate 
The discount rate on 14 day Bills will be set at quarterly intervals such that the effective yield of this instrument will be 
equivalent to the interest rate on ways and means advances (WMA) chargeable to Central Government.  
 
Rediscounting 
The bills will be rediscounted at 50 basis points higher than the discount rate. On rediscounting, the bills will be 
extinguished.  
 
The State Governments will, however, continue to participate as `non-competitive' bidders in 91 day Treasury Bill auctions.
