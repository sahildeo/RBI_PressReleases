Investment by Foreign Institutional Investors - Monitoring ceiling 
The Reserve Bank of India has withdrawn the restrictions placed on further purchase of shares of M/s. Infosys 
Technologies Ltd., Bangalore by FIIs/NRIs/OCBs under the Portfolio Investment Scheme. It has conveyed that 
as the percentage of FIIs/NRIs/OCBs investment in the company has reached 26 per cent of its paid up capital, 
further purchases of equity shares of the company on behalf of FIIs/NRIs/OCBs will be allowed only after 
obtaining prior clearance from the Reserve Bank of India. The holdings of FIIs/NRIs/OCBs in this company have 
come down to 26 per cent as a result of increase in its paid up capital and sale of its equity shares. The RBI had 
placed the restriction on further purchases of equity shares of Infosys Technologies Ltd. by FIIs/NRIs/OCBs/ in 
August, 1997.
