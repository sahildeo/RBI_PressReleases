Financial Performance of the Private Corporate Business Sector during the First Half of 1996-97 
The financial performance of the Private Corporate Business Sector during the first half of 1996-97 has been provisionally 
assessed based on the half-yearly results of 1,169 companies published in the financial dailies. The study covered 1,069 
non-financial companies and 100 financial companies. These results during the first half of 1996-97 indicate that the 
performance of the companies was not so impressive as in the corresponding period of 1995-96. Gross profits of these 
companies reported moderate growth but post-tax profits declined marginally due to high growth in interest payments and 
tax provision.  
The main income of 1,169 companies registered a growth of 16.8 per cent in the first half of 1996-97 and amounted to Rs 
1,11,597 crore as against Rs 95,520 crore in the corresponding period of 1995-96 (Table 1). Other income of these 
companies went up by 8.5 per cent. Total expenditure incurred by these companies increased by 17.1 per cent amounting 
to Rs 93,364 crore. Depreciation provision recorded a raise of 30.0 per cent. Gross profits increased by 11.5 per cent to Rs 
16,838 crore from 15,096 crore in the first half of 1995-96. During the current half year period, interest payment increased 
by 38.2 per cent. Pre-tax profits declined marginally by 0.4 per cent to Rs 10,362 crore in 1996-97. As tax provision 
increased by 23.2 per cent, post-tax profits declined by 5.1 per cent to Rs 8,254 crore in the first half of 1996-97 from Rs 
8,698 crore in the half year ending September 1996.

 The declining trend in profits of the companies was reflected in all the profitability ratios (Table 2). Profit margin declined by 
0.7 percentage point to 15.1 per cent in the first half of 1996-97. On the other hand, the effective tax rate (tax provision to 
profits before tax) increased substantially to 20.3 per cent during 1996-97 from 16.4 per cent in 1995-96. The proportion of 
interest payments to gross profits rose to 38.5 per cent from 31.1 per cent observed in the corresponding previous half 
year. As interest payments grew faster than sales, interest burden (measured as a ratio of interest payments to sales) also 
increased from 4.9 per cent to 5.8 per cent. The limited information available indicates that the rise in interest payments 
was partly due to growth in the level of borrowing and partly due to rise in interest rate. Substantial increases in the effective 
tax rate and interest burden adversely affected the ratio of the post-tax profits to sales which declined to 7.4 per cent in 
1996-97 from 9.1 per cent in 1995-96.

The 1,069 non-financial companies included in the study increased their sales by 16.7 per cent and gross profits by 11.7 
per cent during the first half of 1996-97. Due to higher interest payments (40.6 per cent), profits before tax showed a 
marginal decline in the current half year. Tax provision was higher by 24.3 per cent. As such, post-tax profits declined by 
4.9 per cent.  
The main income of 100 financial companies reported an increase of 21.6 per cent while other income organized by 38.2 
per cent in the first half of 1996-97. Total expenditure of these companies increased at a higher rate (28.4 per cent) than the 
main income. The growth rate in gross profits, as a consequence, was contained to 9.6 per cent. Pre-tax profits and post-
tax profits declined by 4.5 per cent and 7.2 per cent respectively. A notable feature for financial companies was that both 
the interest payments and tax provision increased at a relatively lower rates of 24.5 per cent and 9.3 per cent respectively 
as compared with those of non-financial companies.  
The size group wise analysis of the 1,169 companies according to sales revealed that the companies with sales of less than 
Rs 1 crore incurred losses whereas companies in other size groups posted profits. The analysis also showed that interest 
burden was the highest for companies in this size class (63.6 per cent).

Industry-wise details of non-financial companies revealed that there are wide variations in the growth rates across the 
industries. Most of the industries reported decline in post-tax profits. Sales growth was the highest for Trading companies 
(38.8 per cent) followed by Mining and Quarrying companies (33.8 per cent). Engineering and Chemical companies 
registered growth rates of 22.5 per cent and 15.5 per cent respectively. Growth rates in gross profits were high for Rubber 
and Rubber products, Hotels and Tea companies (56.4 per cent, 23.3 per cent and 22.2 per cent respectively). Post-tax 
profits of these industries also recorded high growth rates at 84.8 per cent, 28.9 per cent and 13.0 per cent respectively. 
Mining and Quarrying, Silk and Rayon Textiles and Paper and Paper products registered significant declines in post-tax 
profits.
