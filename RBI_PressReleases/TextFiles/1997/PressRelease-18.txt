No rebooking for contracts cancelled for non-trade related transactions : RBI tells 
corporates 
During the recent scrutiny of banks by the Reserve Bank of India, it has been observed 
that a number of corporates which have long term repayment commitments as well as 
those which run exposures on account of foreign currency balances retained abroad 
since long have been using the volatility in the market to take a view on the currency 
movements. While it is recognised that corporates need to hedge their exposures in the 
current scenario excessive speculation on currency movements needs to be curbed. 
Therefore, it has been decided that in respect of non-trade related transactions, 
contracts once cancelled should not be rebooked for the same underlying exposure. It 
will, however, be open to corporates to rollover these contracts on maturity at ongoing 
rates. This instruction takes immediate effect.
