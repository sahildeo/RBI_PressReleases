No need to approach RBI for foreign exchange for travel to Bangladesh or Pakistan 
 
The Reserve Bank of India has permitted bank branches authorised to deal in foreign exchange and functioning 
under the areas of jurisdiction of Calcutta, Patna, Guwahati, Chandigarh and New Delhi offices to release 
foreign exchange for travel by land route to Bangladesh or Pakistan. The authorised dealers can release foreign 
exchange to travellers to these countries up to US $200 per person per trip within the overall entitlement of 
Basic Travel Quota (BTQ) during a particular calendar year without production of journey ticket. The authorised 
dealer may also release amount of exchange to travellers visiting Myanmar on the same conditions.  
Accordingly, travellers need not approach the Reserve Bank offices for release of foreign exchange for travel to 
Bangladesh or Pakistan.
