RBI announces two further measures in respect of Foreign Exchange 
Market 
Reserve Bank of India has announced to-day two further measures in respect of foreign 
exchange market.  
1. Until further notice, in respect of Overdue export bills, banks will charge, with 
effect from December 18, 1997, interest at 20 per cent per annum (minimum). 
Overdue export bills are those which are not realised within the due date, taking 
into account usance period of the bill, transit period, as specified by Foreign 
Exchange Dealers' Association of India (FEDAI) and grace period, wherever 
applicable. The higher rate of interest on Overdue export bills will apply from the 
date of advance.  
The Reserve Bank has clarified that in the case of demand bills and short-term 
usuance bills the higher rate of interest will not be applicable where the total 
period of credit including the period of Overdue is less than one month from the 
date of bill/negotiation.  
The Reserve Bank has further stated that a large number of applications are 
received in its offices for permission for extension of time limit for realisation of 
export proceeds beyond due date. Unless there is a strong case for extension, 
Reserve Bank will not grant extension of time limit.  
2. The Reserve Bank has further decided to introduce an Interest rate surcharge of 
15 per cent of the lending rate (excluding interest tax) on bank credit for imports 
with effect from December 18, 1997, until further notice. The requirement of 
interest rate surcharge will, however, not be applicable in respect of bank credit 
for export-related imports i.e., export packing credit to meet the cost of imported 
inputs, import of capital goods under the Export Promotion Capital Goods 
Scheme (EPCG Scheme), exports by Export-oriented units (EOUs) and units in 
the Export Processing Zones (EPZs) and imports of `inputs' under Advance 
Licences. Similarly, bulk imports in respect of crude oil, petroleum products, 
fertilisers, edible oils and other essential commodities imported through 
Government agencies will also be exempted from interest surcharge.
