Guidelines for Transactions in Government Securities by Foreign Institutional Investors 
(FIIs) 
As per Securities and Exchange Board of India Notification No. S.O.495(E) dated July 10, 1997 
the "transactions in Government Securities (by FIIs) shall be carried out in a manner specified by 
the Reserve Bank of India". In this regard, in its guidelines dated March 8, 1997, the Reserve 
Bank of India had already specified the manner of transactions by authorised FIIs in dated 
Government Securities which are reproduced below:  
1. For the purpose of FII investment, dated Government Securities would include dated 
securities of both Government of India and State Governments of all maturities but would 
not include Treasury Bills.  
2. Investment in dated Government Securities by FIIs may be either in the primary market at 
the auction/floatation or in the secondary market.  
3. Investment by FIIs in dated Government Securities should be undertaken only through 
the designated banks, i.e., any bank in India which has been authorised by the Reserve 
Bank to act as a banker to Foreign Institutional Investors.  
4. Investment by FIIs will be allowed only in the form of Subsidiary General Ledger (SGL) 
Account through a bank having both SGL Account No.II (Constituents' Account) and 
current Account with the Reserve Bank of India.  
5. The secondary market transactions by FIIs will be permitted through recognised Indian 
Stock Exchanges or over-the-counter with SGL Account holders and will be governed by 
the Delivery Versus Payment system of Reserve Bank of India.  
Reserve Bank of India further clarifies that FIIs authorised to invest in dated Government 
Securities as per its Guidelines would include only "100 per cent Debt Funds."
