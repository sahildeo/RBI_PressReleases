Clarifications on RBI  Guidelines for Primary  Dealers and Satellite Dealers 
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) announced the "Guidelines for Primary Dealers in Government Securities Market" on 
March 29, 1995 with the last date set for receiving the applications as April 30, 1995. Based on the applications received, 
the RBI granted "in principle" approval to three companies, viz., Securities Trading Corporation of India Ltd. (STCI), 
Discount and Finance House of India Ltd. (DFHI), ICICI Securities and Finance Company Ltd. (I-SEC) and to three banks, 
viz., State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank and Canara Bank (jointly with public sector banks) to set up subsidiaries for 
undertaking primary dealership. STCI, DFHI and I-SEC and the bank subsidiaries set up later, viz., `SBI Gilts', `PNB Gilts' 
and `Gilt Securities Trading Corporation of India' were given primary dealer authorisation in two stages in February 1996 
and May 1996.  
The RBI announced the "Guidelines for Satellite Dealers in Government Securities Market" on December 31, 1996 with the 
last date set for receiving the applications as January 31, 1997. The applications received for satellite dealership are under 
various stages of disposal.  
The RBI now clarifies that the receipt of application and approval for both primary dealership and satellite dealership will be 
an `on-going' process and those entities satisfying the eligibility criteria may apply to the RBI for consideration for primary 
dealership/satellite dealership, as the case may be.  
The RBI also clarifies that in the case of scheduled commercial banks and all India financial institutions intending to set up 
subsidiaries specifically with the objective of under taking primary dealership/satellite dealership, they may apply to the RBI 
furnishing details of their plan about the proposed subsidiaries. On acceptance `in principle' by the RBI, such bank and all 
India financial institution may proceed to set up the subsidiary, which in turn will be allowed to directly apply to the RBI for 
grant of authorisation.
