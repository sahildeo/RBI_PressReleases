Portfolio investment by FIIs/NRIs/OCBs - Purchase up to 30 per cent 
The equity shares and convertible debentures of the Gujarat Ambuja Cements Ltd. can 
now be purchased under the portfolio investment scheme subject to certain conditions. 
The company has since passed the necessary resolutions agreeing for the purchase of 
its equity shares and convertible debentures by foreign institutional investors/non-
residents of Indian nationality/origin (NRIs) and overseas corporate bodies owned to the 
extent of at least 60 per cent by such persons (OCBs) up to 30 per cent of its issued and 
paid up capital through stock exchanges under the portfolio investment scheme. This 
has been done in terms of Government of India press release No. 14/11/96-NRI dated 
April 4, 1997 raising the portfolio investment ceiling for all FIIs/NRIs/OCBs in Indian 
companies from 24 per cent to 30 per cent of their issued and paid-up capital.  
It may be recalled that the RBI had, in October 1997, advised that no further purchase of 
equity shares of this company should be made on behalf of FIIs/NRIs/OCBs from the 
secondary market, as the then overall ceiling of 24 per cent had been reached.
