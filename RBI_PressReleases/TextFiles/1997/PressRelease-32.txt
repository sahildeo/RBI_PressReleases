of India.  
It may be recalled that the Reserve Bank of India, Central Office, Mumbai grants automatic approval for foreign 
investment in the equity capital up to 50, 51 or 74 per cent, as the case may be in respect of 
industries/products/items of finding place in the MOI press note dated June 24, 1992, further expanded in terms 
of MOI press note dated January 17, 1997. The products listed in the 1992 press note were classified under ITC 
(HS) coding system and those listed in the press note of 1997 carried code number under the NIC system, 
1987. With a view to having a consolidated list of Annexure III items eligible for foreign investment under the 
automatic route of the Reserve Bank with uniform code numbers, the MOI notified through its press note dated 
October 8, 1997 (No. 14 - 1997 seires) a revised list of industries/items eligible for investment up to 50, 51 or 74 
per cent. This list has been recast on the basis of uniform NIC code system superceding the earlier press notes

Accordingly, henceforth applications for automatic approval of the Reserve Bank for foreign investment should 
be in respect of products/items listed in the press note dated October 8, 1997. Before making the applications, 
the applicants should satisfy themselves that the products/items are covered in the revised list. Further, all 
applications to the Reserve Bank should contain, besides description of the product items, the relevant NIC 
code numbers as appearing in the list.
