Sep 10,1997 
Statement by Dr. C Rangarajan, Governor, Reserve Bank of India on developments 
in the foreign exchange market  
After a prolonged period of stability, the rupee has depreciated against the dollar in the 
last two weeks. The depreciation is of the order of 2.5 per cent. At the present level, the 
rupee depreciation in relation to the dollar is far less than in the case of East Asian 
currencies, which have experienced unusual turbulence. The fundamentals of the Indian 
economy, more particularly in relation to the external sector, are very sound. The current 
account deficit has remained low and it is estimated to be at 1.0 per cent of GDP for 
1996-97. It is not likely to exceed 1.5 per cent in 1997-98. The capital inflows under the 
various routes - non-resident deposits, portfolio investments, direct investments and 
external commercial borrowings - are steady and strong. Foreign exchange reserves 
increased by US$ 5.2 billion in 1996-97 and by a further US$ 4 billion in the current 
financial year till the end of August 1997.  
The recent volatility seen in the exchange rate has been caused in a large measure by 
the rush to cover unhedged positions. There has been no basic change in the 
fundamentals of the economy which continue to remain strong. Market participants both 
in the spot and forward markets are, therefore, advised to take note of the basic trends.  
The Reserve Bank will continue to intervene both in the spot and forward markets to 
reduce volatility and to ensure orderly conditions in the foreign exchange market.
