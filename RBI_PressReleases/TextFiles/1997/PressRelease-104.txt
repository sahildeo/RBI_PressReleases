System of Ways and Means Advances : Agreement signed between the Government of India and the Reserve Bank 
of India 
The Government of India and the Reserve Bank of India signed an agreement on March 26, 1997 at New Delhi to formally 
put in place the announcement made by the Union Finance Minister in his Budget Speech for 1997-98 as under :  
"The system of ad hoc Treasury Bills to finance the budget deficit will be discontinued with effect from April 1, 1997. A 
scheme of ways and means advances (WMA) by the RBI to the Central government is being introduced to accommodate 
temporary mismatch es in the government's receipts and payments. This will not be a permanent source of financing the 
government's deficit."  
Salient Features of the Agreement 
The salient features of the agreement signed by Dr. C. Rangarajan, Governor, on behalf of the Reserve Bank of India and 
Shri M.S. Ahluwalia, Finance Secretary, on behalf of the President of India are as follows :-  
i The system of ad hoc Treasury Bills to finance budget deficit will be discontinued with effect from April 1, 1997.  
ii. The outstanding ad hoc Treasury Bills as on March 31, 1997 would be funded into special securities, without any 
specified maturity, at an interest rate of 4.6 per cent per annum, on April 1, 1997. The outstanding Tap Treasury Bills as on 
March 31, 1997 will be paid off on maturity with an equivalent creation of special securities without any specified maturity, at 
an interest rate of 4.6 per cent per annum.  
iii. From April 1, 1997 a scheme of Ways and Means Advances (WMA) by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to the 
Government of India (GOI) will be introduced to accommodate temporary mismatch es in Government receipts and 
payments. The limit and the rate of interest on WMA and the rate of interest on Overdraft will be mutually agreed between 
RBI and Government from time to time.  
iv. The arrangements for the fiscal year 1997-98 in respect of WMA limits and rate of interest are :  
a. The limit for Ways and Means Advances will be Rs.12,000 crore for the first half of the year (April to September) and 
Rs.8,000 crore for the second half of the year (October to March).  
b. The interest rate on Ways and Means Advances and Overdraft for the Government will be the following:  
 
(i) Up to the Ways and Means : "Calculated Rate" minus 3 per cent. The "Calculated o73 Rate" for any 
Advances limits. quarter beginning April 1, 1997, will mean the average of the implicit yield 
at the cut-off prices of 91 day Treasury Bill auctions held during the 
previous quarter. 
(ii)For Overdraft beyond the Ways : The rate at (b)(i) plus 2 per cent on the Overdraft amount. 
and Means Advances limits. 
 
v. Overdraft will not be permissible for periods exceeding ten consecutive working days after March 31, 1999.   
It may be recalled that a Supplemental Agreement was signed between the Central Government and the Reserve Bank on 
September 9, 1994 to phase out the system of ad hoc Treasury Bills, over a period of three years. It was agreed that the 
net issue of ad hoc Treasury Bills at the end of the year 1994-95 was not to exceed Rs.6,000 crore and that, if the net issue 
of ad hoc Treasury Bills exceeded Rs.9,000 crore for more than ten consecutive working days at any time during the year, 
the Reserve Bank would automatically reduce the level of ad hoc Treasury Bills, by auctioning Treasury Bills or selling fresh 
Government of India dated securities in the market. Similar ceilings at Rs.5,000 crore for year end and Rs.9,000 crore for 
intra year were stipulated for 1995-96 and 1996-97. The scheme of phasing out ad hocs worked reasonably well. While in 
1994-95 the agreement was strictly adhered to both in terms of year end level of ad hoc Treasury Bills as well as the intra 
year limit, in 1995-96 there were prolonged periods in which intra year limit was exceeded. During 1996-97 since August 
14, 1996 the net issue of ad hocs has remained below within the year limit.  
 
Difference betwen ad hocs and WMA 
There are significant differences between the earlier scheme of monetising budget deficits through ad hocs and WMA:  
First, WMA is not a source of financing and as such will not be shown as a source of financing Budget Deficit. It is only a 
mechanism to cover day-to-day mismatches in receipts and payments of the Government. The new system implies 
therefore periodic vacation of advances made and not accumulation year after year.  
 
Secondly, limits on WMA will be fixed and any excess drawal by Government beyond the limit will not be permissible for 
more than ten consecutive working days after March 1999.  
 
Thirdly, WMA will be charged at market related interest rate.  
 
RBI Support for Market Borrowing 
An amount of Rs.16,000 crore has been indicated in the Budget for 1997-98 as the "Monetised Fiscal Deficit" which 
represents the expected level of RBI's support ex ante to Central Government borrowing. This amount reflects the RBI 
support to primary issues of Central Government securities. The actual support ex post could be different from the amount 
of Rs.16,000 crore on account of Open Market Operations by the Reserve Bank of India depending upon emerging 
monetary situation. Illustratively in 1993-94, RBI's support to primary issues was Rs.7014 crore but the monetised deficit 
was only Rs.260 crore. Similarly, in 1996-97, till March 14, RBI support was Rs.13,044 crore but net RBI credit was only 
Rs.3,795 crore.  
 
During the transition period up to March 1999, the over draft would be permissible beyond ten consecutive working days. It 
is expected that under the new system the Government will stay well within the limit stipulated in the Agreement. The new 
system while ensuring fiscal discipline would establish a reasonable mechanism of financing the day to day requirements of 
the Government of India. The fresh agreement will provide greater autonomy to the Reserve Bank in formulating and 
implementing monetary policy.
