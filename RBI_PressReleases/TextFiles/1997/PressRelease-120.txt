RBI hosts BIS seminar on payment and settlement systems for central banks of SAARC 
countries 
 
Dr C Rangarajan, Governor, Reserve Bank of India, will, on Monday, inaugurate a five-day seminar on 
payment and settlement systems for the central banks of the SAARC countries. The seminar has been 
hosted by the Reserve Bank is cooperation with the Bank for International Settlements and is being 
held at the RBI's College of Agricultural Banking, Pune between January 13 and 17, 1997. Twenty 
senior central bank officials of six SAARC countries, viz., Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, Republic 
of Maldives and Sri Lanka are participating in the seminar.  
The seminar aims at explaining the structure and functioning of payment and settlement systems in a 
modern market economy. The focus will be on policy issues relating to payment systems, in particular 
those seen from a central banker's perspective. The issues include the linkage between payment 
system and financial stability (payment systems risk management) and between payment systems and 
monetary policy (banks; liquidity management, the role of the money market and the function of the 
central bank as lender of last report). The primary attention will be on the economic, financial and legal 
aspects of payment systems, i.e., how payment and settlement systems form part of an efficient, stable 
and competitive banking and financial industry, rather than on operational and technical aspects. 
Payment systems will also be viewed in a broad way to include not only funds transfer systems but 
exchange-of-value systems such as those for securities and foreign exchange.  
The seminar would consist of a number of presentations to be given by officials from the Bank for 
International Settlements and various G-10 member central banks. Each presentation will be followed 
by a discussion session. The presenations and the background material provided will cover 
experiences of countries with advanced market economies. A half-day discussion on developments in 
payment system in SAARC countries is also scheduled.
