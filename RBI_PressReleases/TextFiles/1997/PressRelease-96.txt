RBI frees interest rates on FCNR(Banks) deposits 
Presently, the interest rates on Foreign Currency ( Non- Resident ) (Banks) (FCNR)(B) 
deposits are determined by the Reserve Bank Of India. In the Monetary and Credit 
policy for the first half of 1997-98 announced by the Governor of Reserve Bank Of India, 
the authorised dealers have been given more flexibility in regard to the fixation of interest 
rates on such deposits. Accordingly, banks may, now determine interest rates on 
FCNR(B) deposits, subject to a ceiling prescribed by the Reserve Bank Of India from 
time to time.  
With effect from April 16, 1997 the ceilings on interest rates on FCNR(B) deposits of 
various maturities in the four currencies will be as under:
