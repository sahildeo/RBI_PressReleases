Issue of Rs. 10 notes in Mahatma Gandhi series with capital letter 'M' inset in numbering panels 
 
The Reserve Bank of India had earlier issued three series of Rs. 10 denomination notes with Mahatama gandhi' 
portrait, one without any inset in numbering panel and the others with capital letter 'R' and 'L' in both the 
numbering panels. The Reserve Bank of India will now issue Rs. 10 notes in the Mahatma Gandhi series 
bearing the signature of Dr. C. Rangrajan with capital letter inset 'M' in both the numbering panels. Except for 
this change, the design of the ten rupee note to be issued now is similar in all respects to those issued earlier in 
th Mahatma gandhi series. All Rs 10 notes in various designs issued by the Reserve Bank in the past will 
continue to be legal tender.
