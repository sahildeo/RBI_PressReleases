RBI norms for financing of infrastructure projects relaxed 
With a view to enhacing the volume of resources available for infrastructure investment, the 
Reserve Bank has advised the banks that their credit exposure to borrowers belonging to a group 
may exceed the prudential exposure norm of 50 per cent, in relation to a bank's capital funds, by 
an additional 10 per cent provided the additional credit exposure is on account of infrastructure 
projects (i.e., power, telecommunications, roads and ports). In the case of exposure of banks to a 
single borrower, the prudential exposure norm of 25 per cent of the bank's capital funds remains 
unchanged.  
The Reserve Bank has also advised the banks that, henceforth, they may provide term finance to 
all projects including infrastructure projects without any ceiling subject, however, to compliance 
with the prudential exposure norms. Hitherto, such financing was subject to a monetary ceiling of 
Rs. 500 crore for a single project in sectors other than power generation and Rs. 1,000 crore in 
the case of power generation projects.
