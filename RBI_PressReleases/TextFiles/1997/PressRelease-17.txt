Recent Developments in Foreign Exchange Markets - Package of Measures 
In view of recent domestic and international developments which were affecting foreign 
exchange markets in India, the Reserve Bank of India had recently announced a 
package of measures. These included deferment of future programme for bringing about 
a reduction in cash reserve ratio (CRR), increase in interest rate on post-shipment rupee 
export credit, as well as ban on rebooking of cancelled forward contracts on non-trade 
transactions.  
2. Taking into account developments since then, and the prevailing situation in the 
financial and foreign exchange markets, the Reserve Bank of India has 
announced a further package of measures today. These measures are 
temporary and will be kept under review with a view to adjusting them in the light 
of further developments.  
3. The Reserve Bank of India reiterates that the fundamentals of the economy, viz, 
economic growth, current account deficit, the ratio of short term debt to reserves 
and inflation continue to be positive and strong. The net capital inflows and 
expected to exceed the projected current account deficit, which is in any case 
quite low.  
4. The measures taken today are:  
 
i. CRR to be Raised by 0.5 percentage point to 10.0 per cent  
The CRR on net demand and time liabilities of scheduled commercial 
banks which stands presently at 9.5 per cent is increased by 0.5 
percentage point to 10.0 per cent with effect from the fortnight beginning 
December 6, 1997. The schedule of reductions in CRR already 
announced is kept in abeyance.  
ii. Incremental CRR on Non-Resident Rupee Deposits Removed  
The 10 per cent incremental CRR on non-resident rupee deposits under 
Non-resident (External) Rupee and Non-resident Non-repatriable Rupee 
Deposits schemes stands removed with effect from the fortnight 
beginning December 6, 1997.  
iii. Fixed Rate Repos  
The interest rate on fixed rate repos for tomorrow (December 3), stands 
increased to 5.0 per cent from 4.5 per cent.  iv. Booking of Forward Contracts  
The facility granted to authorised dealers in April 1997 to offer forward 
contracts based on past performance and declaration of an exposure 
stands suspended temporarily. Henceforth, banks may allow forward 
contracts based only on documents evidencing exposure.
