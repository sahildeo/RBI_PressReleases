Review of flow of credit from banking sector 
Shri S.P. Talwar, Deputy Governor, RBI met CMDs and Senior Officials of leading public 
sector banks today at Mumbai to discuss the prevailing situation in the credit 
dispensation by the banks to the commercial sector.  
At the outset he mentioned that the recent measures announced by the Reserve Bank 
keeping in view the prevailing situation in finance and forex markets were temporary and 
that they should not come in the way of flow of credit to the commercial sector. Referring 
to the concern of credit offtake in the current financial year, Shri Talwar pointed out that 
the non food bank credit to commercial sector upto November 21, 1997 had increased 
only by Rs. 3660 crores. However, ifTalwar Shri the bank' investments in commercial 
paper, bonds and debentures and shares of PSUs and corporate sector were taken into 
account, the total flow of resources from scheduled commercial banks to commercial 
sector had increased by Rs. 14384 crores as compared to Rs. 5651 crores in the 
previous year. Shri Talwar expressed central bank's concern in slow offtake of bank 
credit.  
The bankers were of the view that they had enough lendable resources and additional 
credit sanctions during the current financial year upto November 21, 1997 were to the 
extent of Rs. 24680 crores as against additional sanctions of Rs. 13001 crores during 
the corresponding period last year. The bankers pointed out that the corporate sector 
was resorting to various other means of financing and the financial institutions had also 
started giving working capital finance in a larger way. The demand for credit has started 
picking up during November 1997 and it is expected that the credit growth in the coming 
months will be quite encouraging. Mr Talwar expressed the view that it is the medium 
and small segments of industry and trade which require more financial support from 
banks. After viewing the current situation, bankers were advised to step up the flow of 
credit by activating the functionaries at operative levels and to monitor the credit growth 
on a monthly basis. The bankers were advised to convene meetings of regional and 
zonal heads and visit some of the branches to monitor the situation.  
The bankers assured the Reserve Bank that they will give thrust to the financing of trade 
and commerce and put in place measures for ensuring adequate flow of credit to all 
sectors.  
 
 It was also decided to set up a working group to formulate modalities for extending credit 
to software industry.
