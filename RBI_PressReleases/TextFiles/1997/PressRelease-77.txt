Foreign exchange rules relaxed 
The Reserve Bank of India has substantially liberalised rules for release of foreign 
exchange for activities such as employment and basic travel quota (BTQ). The Reserve 
Bank has also significantly enhanced the powers of authorised dealers(ADs) in release 
of exchange and simplified the procedure for certain trade related activities. In terms of 
these enhanced powers, ADs can now release foreign exchange:  
• up to US$ 3,000 per person towards basic travel quota.  
• up to US$ 2,500 per person in addition to the BTQ entitlement of US$ 3,000 for 
going abroad on employment.  
• up to US$ 1,000 per person per year towards gift to relatives/friends.  
• US$ 1,000 towards donations to charitable/educational/religious/cultural 
organisations abroad.  
Earlier, authorised dealers could release foreign exchange up to US$ 2,000 per 
beneficiary towards basic travel quota, US$ 500 per calendar year per beneficiary 
towards gift, US$ 500 towards donations and US$ 500 per person or US$ 1,000 per 
family for emigration.  
 
The Reserve Bank has also enhanced the limit for ADs to effect advance remittances 
towards import without a bank guarantee from US $5,000 to US$15,000 or equivalent as 
the earlier limit was fixed a few years ago.  
 
The authorised dealers can now also release foreign exchange towards service related 
remittances, such as, tie-up arrangements between Indian agents and overseas 
principals for booking of hotel accommodation and use of prepaid telecard abroad and a 
percentage as advance payment; remittances of surplus freight collections by offline 
carriers, surplus passage/freight collection by foreign shipping companies, remittances 
of break bulk agents' remuneration on outward consolidation of air cargo, operating 
expenses of Indian airlines/shipping companies, remittances of operational charges by 
Indian courier companies, and repatriation of current income, etc.  
 
The details of the delegated powers as enclosed in the annexure are also available at 
the RBI website at http://www.reservebank.com.
