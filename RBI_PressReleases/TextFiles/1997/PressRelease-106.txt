RBI Guidelines for FII investment in dated Government Securities 
As a sequel to the Government's decision to permit Foreign Institutional Investors(FIIs) to invest in dated Government 
Securities, the Reserve Bank of India has announced the following guidelines for FIIs authorised to invest in dated 
Government Securities :  
1. For the purpose of FII investment, dated Government Securities would include dated securities of both Government

2. Investment in dated Government Securities by FIIs may be made either in the primary market at the 
auction/floatation or in the secondary market.  
3. Investment by FIIs in dated Government Securities should be undertaken only through designated banks, i.e., any 
bank in India which has been authorised by the Reserve Bank to act as a banker to Foreign Institutional Investors.  
4. Investment by FIIs will be allowed only in the form of Subsidiary General Ledger (SGL) Account through a bank 
having both SGL Account No.II (Constituents' Account) and current Account with the Reserve Bank of India.  
5. The secondary market transactions by FIIs will be permitted through recognised Indian Stock Exchanges or over-the-
counter with SGL Account holders and will be governed by the Delivery Versus Payment system of the Reserve Bank 
of India.
