on CD ROM
The Reserve Bank of India today released a CD ROM on Handbook of Statistics
on State Government Finances, as a part of its persistent endeavour towards better
data dissemination. The Reserve Bank had released the print and the web versions of
the Handbook on July 2, 2004.
The Handbook covers State-wise data from 1980-81 onwards on major fiscal
indicators and State-wise detailed data from 1990-91 onwards on budgetary
transactions in the revenue and capital accounts.
The CD ROM incorporates intelligent search features. The search features can
be used, among other things, to obtain data in MS-EXCEL format by selecting the
