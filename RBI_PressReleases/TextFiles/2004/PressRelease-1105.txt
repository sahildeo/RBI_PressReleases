March 29, 2004 Revised limits of Ways and Means Advances to State Governments Effective April 1, 2004 the revised aggregate normal Ways and Means Advances (WMA) of the State Governments will be Rs.8140 crore as against the present limits of Rs.7170 crore, representing an increase of Rs.970 crore or about 13.53 per cent. The minimum normal WMA limit is Rs.50 crore for any State. These revised WMA limits have been computed by taking into account the average of revenue receipts for the fiscal years 2000-2001, 2001-2002 and 2002-2003 and then applying to this average, a multiplication factor of 3.19 per cent for the non-special category States and 3.84 per cent for the special category States respectively as recommended by the Advisory Committee on Ways and Means Advances to State Governments (Ramchandran Committee).The other features of the WMA/Overdraft (OD) Scheme 2003 will remain unchanged. The salient features of the WMA/OD Scheme 2003 are as detailed below:  Normal WMA The rate of interest charged on normal WMA is (a) Bank Rate (currently 6 per cent) for the period of 1 to 90 days and (b) one per cent above the Bank Rate for the period beyond 90 days.  Special WMA The Special WMA limit is linked to the investments made by State Governments in the Government of India securities, i.e., dated securities and Treasury Bills. A lower and uniform margin of five per cent is being applied now on the market value of the securities for determining the operating limit of Special WMA. The States will have to avail of Special WMA limits first before seeking accommodation under the normal WMA limits. The rate of interest applicable to Special WMA is one per cent below the Bank Rate.  Minimum Balance The present scheme of maintaining minimum balance with the RBI continues. There is no change in the amount of minimum balance to be maintained by the State Governments.  Overdraft Regulation Scheme The maximum number of days that a State can be in overdraft is 14 consecutive working days. In case the overdraft continues in the State's account beyond 14 consecutive working days, the RBI and its agencies shall stop payments in respect of the concerned State Government.
