RBI relaxes Service Area Norms
To give easy access to rural borrowers to institutional credit from any bank of
their choice at a competitive price and to provide banks, public and private, with a
level playing field, the Reserve Bank has relaxed the service area norms. Now
commercial banks and regional rural banks (RRBs) would be free to lend in any rural
and semi-urban area and borrowers too would have the choice of approaching any
branch for their credit requirements. The allocation of villages among rural and semi-
urban branches of banks shall, however, continue to be applicable for lending under
Government sponsored schemes.
The Reserve Bank has also dispensed with the requirement of non-service
area branches obtaining a ‘no due certificate’ from the service area branch prior to
lending.  Banks have, however, been advised to take necessary steps to avoid
multiple financing.
It may be recalled that the Service Area Approach (SAA) was introduced in
April 1989, to bring about an orderly and planned development of the rural and semi-
urban areas of the country. Under the SAA, all rural and semi-urban branches of
banks were allocated specific villages, generally in geographical contiguous areas.
The respective branches were required to take care of the overall development and
credit needs of the villages allocated to them.
