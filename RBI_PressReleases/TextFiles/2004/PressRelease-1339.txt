Prepayment of Foreign Currency Loans 
The Government of India has prepaid a portion of bilateral foreign 
currency loans amounting to Euro 361.47 million by purchasing the necessary 
foreign exchange from the Reserve Bank of India at the prevailing exchange rate 
after taking into account the strong foreign exchange position and interest rates 
prevailing in the domestic market. The above prepayment mainly will be financed 
through re-issuance of '5.64 per cent Government Stock 2019' for Rs.2,000 crore 
(face value) to the Reserve Bank of India at a price of Rs. 98.69 per Rs. 100 
(face value) on a private placement basis on January 30, 2004. The balance 
amount will be financed out of Government's cash holding. 
 
Since the fresh rupee borrowings by the government (through private 
placements with the Reserve Bank of India) will be used exclusively to match an 
equivalent amount of debts in foreign currency being retired, with equivalent 
residual maturity, the transactions will not have any implications on aggregated 
debt position of the Government. Further, the monetary impact of the fresh 
borrowing will be neutralized by equivalent Rupee payment by Government of 
India to Reserve Bank of India towards the purchase of foreign exchange. The 
reduction in the Reserve Bank's foreign exchange assets will be matched by a 
corresponding increase in the domestic assets in the form of Government 
securities acquired by way of private placement.
