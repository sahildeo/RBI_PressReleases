RBI to function normally on September 30, 2004
The Reserve Bank of India has stated that its offices in Mumbai and
Navi Mumbai will conduct normal business on Thursday, September 30, 2004.
Commercial banks and co-operative banks will, however, remain closed for
public on that day on account of half-yearly closing of their accounts. There
will, therefore, be no clearing on that day at Brihanmumbai Bankers' Clearing
House, National Clearing Centres at Nariman Point and Bandra Kurla
Complex and SBI MiCR Cheque Processing Centre, Worli. The settlement of
MICR cheques presented on September 29 will be done on Friday, October 1,
2004.
