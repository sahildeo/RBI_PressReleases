uniform price format. The Government of India has also announced a sale of a new
30-year Stock for a notified amount of Rs 2,000 crore (nominal) through a yield based
auction using uniform price method. The Reserve Bank of India will conduct the

The Floating Rate Bonds will be of 11-year tenure and will be issued at par.
(i.e., at Rs. 100.00 per cent).  The bonds will carry an interest rate, which is calculated
by adding a 'spread' to a variable base rate. The 'spread'   will be decided in the
auction to be conducted by Reserve Bank of India and will remain unchanged during
the currency of the bonds. The variable base rate will be the average rate of the
implicit yields at cut-off prices emerging in the immediate previous three auctions of
‘Government of India 364 day Treasury Bills’ held prior to the relative annual coupon
reset period. The interest will be paid every half year.  The base rate for calculation of
interest for the first coupon period commencing from August 10, 2004 to August 9,
2005 as per the aforesaid formula is 4.62 per cent (please see the enclosed
illustration). The base rate for the subsequent annual coupon periods, worked out as
per the aforesaid formula, will be announced by RBI on or before the commencement
of the respective coupon reset period.
