Availability of Rupee and Forex Liquidity
The Reserve Bank of India is closely monitoring the developments in
the stock markets and the other financial markets and stands ready to provide
sufficient liquidity to the banks for meeting all their payment obligations
including for any intra-day requirements.
 
A Task Force has been constituted under the Executive Director,
Financial Market Committee (Smt. S. Gopinath) and it can be contacted for
any clarification/ assistance at 22614228 and Fax No.22657604.
 
In the light of current developments in the foreign exchange markets,
as at some previous occasion, the Reserve Bank of India has decided to take
the following actions:
The Reserve Bank will continue to sell dollars through agent banks in
order to augment supply in market or intervene directly to meet any demand
supply imbalances. All the transactions by RBI will be at the prevailing market
rates as per the market practice. FIIs will no doubt continue to take their
decision in regard to reducing or increasing their stake in Indian equity
markets. While RBI welcomes these flows it will also like to ensure that those
FIIs who wish to reduce the investment can do so as easily as possible at
prevailing market rates. As in the past, the authorized dealers acting on behalf
of these FIIs are free to approach the RBI to procure foreign exchange at
prevailing market rates depending on market conditions. RBI would either sell
the foreign exchange directly or advice the concerned bank to buy it in the
market.
 
For any further assistance the Task Force mentioned at para 2 may be
contacted at any time.
