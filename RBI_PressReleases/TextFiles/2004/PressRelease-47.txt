Mechanism for Cards to address various issues relating to regulatory
requirements for credit cards. The Working Group has been set up by drawing
representatives from the banking industry and the regulatory departments of the

to customer protection and to suggest measures for usage of credit cards in a
safe, secure and customer-friendly manner.
