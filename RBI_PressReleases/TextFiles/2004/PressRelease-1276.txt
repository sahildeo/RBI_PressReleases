Prepayment of Foreign Currency Loans
The Government of India has prepaid a portion of foreign currency loans of Asian Development
Bank amounting to 123.11 billion Japanese Yen (Rs.5,294.84 Crore) keeping in view the strong
foreign exchange position and interest rates prevailing in the domestic market. The Government
made the prepayment by purchasing necessary foreign currencies from the Reserve Bank of
India at the prevailing exchange rate. The Government funded the prepayment by issuing a new
dated security, viz., 5.32 per cent Government Stock 2014 to the Reserve Bank on a private
placement basis on February 16, 2004 for Rs.5000 crore and paid the balance amount to the
Reserve Bank out of its cash balance. The coupon of the security was fixed on the basis of
prevailing secondary market yield for 10-year Government paper at 12.45 P.M. today.
Since the fresh rupee borrowings by the government (through private placement with the Reserve
Bank of India) have been used exclusively to retire the foreign currency debt of equivalent
residual maturity, the transaction does not have any implication on aggregate debt position of the
Government. The monetary impact of the additional borrowing, through private placement is also
neutralised by equivalent Rupee payment by Government of India to Reserve Bank of India
towards the purchase of foreign exchange.
