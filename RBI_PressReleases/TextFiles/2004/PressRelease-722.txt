• Merchandise exports and imports rose in tandem in January-March 2004.
• As a result, the trade deficit at US $ 4 billion remained stable at the level recorded in
October-December 2003 but well below that of the first quarter (April-June 2003).• Invisibles have been the pivot for the turn around in the current account from deficit to
surplus since 2001-02.
• A steady expansion in net earnings from invisibles occurred through 2003-04, peaking in
the fourth quarter (January-March).
• Tourism, software and remittances were the key drivers of the invisible surplus. Earnings
from travel improved with international tourist traffic rising by 18.5 per cent
• Software exports weathered the global IT slowdown and protectionist pressure in major
international markets and rose by 27.1 per cent in 2003-04 with the maximum increase
recorded in the fourth quarter.
• Private transfers, comprising mainly remittances from Indians working abroad, rose
steadily through the year with a surge in the third quarter coinciding with the redemption of
Resurgent India Bonds (RIBs).
• India is one of the world’s largest recipients of remittance flows.
• The robust growth of merchandise exports, software, remittances and travel receipts
comfortably financed the large increase in import payments during 2003-04.
• Consequently, the current account balance turned from a modest deficit in the first
quarter to surpluses from the second quarter onwards.• For the full financial year 2003-04, the current account surplus amounted to 1.4 per cent
of GDP, an all time high.

deposits and other elements of banking capital.
• Foreign direct investment remained stable at the preceding year’s level.
• Short-term credits rose in consonance with imports.
• Debt owed to multilateral and bilateral creditors was prepaid to the tune of US $ 3.8
