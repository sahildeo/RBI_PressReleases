Handbook of Statistics on State Government Finances, 2004
The Reserve Bank today released a new publication entitled Handbook of
Statistics on State Government Finances, today, as part of its persistent endeavour
towards better data dissemination.
With the objective of facilitating academic and policy research, the Handbook of
Statistics on State Government Finances provides, for the first time, detailed time-series
data on State-wise budgetary variables. This Handbook is being released in three
versions viz., printed, CD ROM and web-based ( www.rbi.org.in). The CD ROM,
incorporating intelligent search features, would be released shortly.
The data in this Handbook are presented in two broad parts. The first part covers
State-wise data from 1980-81 onwards on major fiscal indicators. The second part
contains State-wise detailed data from 1990-91 onwards on budgetary transactions in
the revenue and capital accounts.
It may be recalled that the Reserve Bank has been publishing The Handbook of
Statistics on the Indian Economy since 1998. This handbook provides time series data
on annual, quarterly, monthly and higher frequencies in respect of the real, monetary,
fiscal, banking, financial and external sectors of the Indian Economy. The Handbook of
Statistics on State Government Finances would supplement The Handbook of Statistics
on the Indian Economy by providing detailed State-wise budgetary data.
Comments on the Handbook of Statistics on State Government Finances may be
sent to the Principal Adviser, Department of Economic Analysis and Policy (DEAP),
Reserve Bank of India, Shahid Bhagat Singh Road, Mumbai 400001 or via email to
narendrajadhav@rbi.org.in
