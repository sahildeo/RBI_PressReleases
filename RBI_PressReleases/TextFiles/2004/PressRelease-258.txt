management in a flexible manner, the auctions of 7-day and 14-day repos will stand
discontinued with effect from November 1, 2004. The LAF scheme from November 1, 2004
would be operated through overnight fixed rate repo and reverse repo. It may also be noted that

of the terms “repo” and “reverse repo”.
