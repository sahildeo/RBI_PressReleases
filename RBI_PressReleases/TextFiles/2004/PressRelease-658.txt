With a view to enlarging the exchange facility to the public, the Reserve
Bank of India has made special arrangement for distribution of packets of
Re.1, Rs.2 and Rs.5 notes and coins in Corporation Bank, Mumbai. The
facility will be offered on July 22, 2004 between 11.00 a.m. and 3.00 p.m. at

In order to make available clean currency notes to public in adequate
quantity, the Reserve Bank has taken several steps in the recent past. These
include making arrangements with the postal authorities in Mumbai for
distribution of coins through the post offices in Maharashtra and Goa and
opening one currency chest branch on one Sunday in a month at selected
centers to exclusively provide currency exchange and distribution of small
coins and suck out the bad notes.
