RBI releases Handbook of Statistics on Indian Economy: 2003-04
The Reserve Bank of India has today released the sixth volume of its annual
statistical publication ‘Handbook of Statistics on the Indian Economy 2003-04’. This
publication is one of the major initiatives of the Reserve Bank aimed at improving data
dissemination by providing a useful storehouse of statistical information at one place.
Through this publication, the Reserve Bank has been providing time series data on major
economic and financial statistics for the Indian economy.
The current volume contains five new tables that provide time series data on
banking indicators, such as, consolidated balance sheet of scheduled commercial banks
(excluding regional rural banks), gross and net NPAs of scheduled commercial banks -
bank group-wise, and distribution of scheduled commercial banks by CRAR. Two of the
new tables are on state-wise per capita net sta te domestic product at factor cost (at
current as well as constant prices). Data series, where possible, have been updated till end-
June 2004 and in some cases even till end-July 2004. The volume for 2003-04 in all
contains 233 statistical tables with the data series covering national income aggregates,
output, prices, money, banking, financial markets, public finances, and trade and balance of
payments indicators. Data for many annual series are provided since 1950-51 in this
volume, though for some aggregates they continue to be available from 1970-71. For
quarterly/monthly and for higher frequency data, the time period coverage is comparatively
short.
The Handbook is brought out in three versions – print, CD-Rom and website. The
CD-Rom incorporates intelligent search facilities that allow users to search across tables
enabling the user to select one or more data series for a selected period from any table.
