RBI reduces Margins for Bank Financing against Shares
On the recommendation made by the Task Force constituted for monitoring
developments in the financial markets, it has been decided to restore, with immediate
effect, the status quo ante on margins that banks have to maintain for financing
against shares/IPOs/issue of guarantees. The margins will now be 40 per cent
against the earlier 50 per cent. Furthermore, the minimum cash margin of 25 per cent
(within the margin of 50 per cent) stands reduced to 20 per cent.
It may be recalled that the margins against shares were increased from the
level of 40 per cent to 50 per cent in January 2004.
