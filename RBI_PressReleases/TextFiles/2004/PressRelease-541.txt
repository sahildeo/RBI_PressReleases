RBI introduces Fixed Rate Overnight Repo under
Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF)
While introducing the revised scheme of Liquidity Adjustment Facility
(LAF) with effect from March 29, 2004, it was indicated that the Reserve Bank
will continue to have the discretion to conduct overnight Repo or longer term
Repo auctions at fixed rate or at variable rates depending on market
conditions and other relevant factors.
On an assessment of the current situation, it has been decided, until
further notice, to introduce overnight fixed rate Repo at 4.50 per cent under
LAF with effect from August 16, 2004 in addition to the existing overnight fixed
rate Reverse Repo at 6.00 per cent.  The current practice of 7-day Repo and
14-day Repo will also continue.
The time limit for submission of bids will continue to be 10.30 a.m. as
now.  The auction results would be announced by 12 noon as at present.  The
bids will continue to be submitted electronically in the Negotiated Dealing
System (NDS).  The other operational guidelines and terms and conditions of
the auction under the LAF would be applicable as at present.
