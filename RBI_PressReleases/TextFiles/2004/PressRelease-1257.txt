Pre-Launch Review of RTGS in India
The Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system is being implemented in two phases in
India. Under the first phase, the RTGS system with the functionalities for inter-bank fund transfer
and customer based inter-bank fund transfer has reached an advanced stage of implementation.
The RTGS system has been tested and is currently undergoing trial run with the participation of
four banks. It is a complex and critical system.
As a measure of abundant caution and also to provide additional comfort that all the
necessary steps have been taken to facilitate real time on-line settlement of inter-bank
transactions, the Reserve Bank of India has constituted an external group of experts to carry out
pre-launch review of the RTGS system including the policies, procedures and technical aspects.
The review is currently in progress.
