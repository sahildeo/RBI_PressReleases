RBI asks Banks to increase Margin for Advances against Shares
The Reserve Bank of India has today asked banks to raise the margin on all advances against shares/financing of Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) and issue of guarantees to 50 per cent with immediate effect. It has also asked banks to raise the minimum cash margin in respect of guarantees issued by banks for capital market operations to 25 per cent (within the margin of 50 per cent). The margin of 50 per cent will apply to all fresh advances/guarantees issued for capital market operations. The existing advances/guarantees issued may continue at the earlier margins until they come up for renewal. At present, banks are required to apply a uniform margin of 40 per cent on all advances against shares/financing of Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) and issue of guarantees. A minimum cash margin of 20 per cent (within the margin of 40 per cent) is required to be maintained in respect of guarantees. Ajit Prasad Manager Press Release : 2003-2004/820
