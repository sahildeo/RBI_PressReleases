Guidelines for acknowledgement of transfer/allotment of shares in 
private banks 
 
RBI has formulated guidelines for acknowledgement of transfer/ 
allotment of shares in private banks.  These guidelines seek to make 
transparent the broad criteria, which will be followed for issuing such 
acknowledgements to avoid uncertainty for potential investors. The 
intensity and comprehensiveness of the due diligence processes at 
various thresholds of shareholding in banks have been evolved to 
protect depositors’ interest as also to ensure soundness of the 
financial system. 
 
The guidelines are available on our website www.rbi.org.in
