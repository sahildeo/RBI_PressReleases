Government of India announce the sale of three dated securities
The Government of India have announced the sale (re-issue) of “6.65 percent
Government Stock 2009”(stock) for a notified amount of Rs.3,000 crore (nominal)
through a price based auction using multiple price auction method, sale of "Floating
Rate Bonds, 2013" (bonds) for an aggregate amount of Rs 4,000 crore (nominal) by
auction using uniform price format and  sale (re-issue) of “8.35 percent Government

based auction using multiple price auction method. The auctions will be conducted by

2004.
The Floating Rate Bonds will be of 9-year tenure and will be issued at par. (i.e.,

adding a 'spread' to a variable base rate. The 'spread' will be decided in the
auction to be conducted by Reserve Bank of India and will remain unchanged during
the currency of the bonds. The variable base rate will be the average rate of the
implicit yields at cut-off prices emerging in the immediate previous three auctions of
‘Government of India 364 day Treasury Bills’ held prior to the relative annual coupon
reset period. The interest will be paid every half year.  The base rate for calculation of
interest for the first coupon period commencing from September 10, 2004 to
September 9, 2005 as per the aforesaid formula is 5.02 per cent per annum (please
see the enclosed illustration). The base rate for the subsequent annual coupon
periods, worked out as per the aforesaid formula, will be announced by RBI on or
before the commencement of the respective coupon reset period.

to eligible individuals and institutions as per the Scheme for Non-Competitive Bidding
