RBI announces Gold Card Scheme for Exporters
The Reserve Bank of India today announced the Gold Card Scheme for
the exporters. As per the scheme, all credit worthy exporters, including those in
small and medium sectors, with good track record will be eligible for Gold Card.
Individual banks will lay down the eligibility criteria for issue of Gold Card.  The
Reserve Bank has asked banks to clearly specify the benefits they would be
offering to the Gold Card holders.
Better terms of credit including rates of interest than those extended to
other exporters by the banks, faster and simpler processing of applications for
credit, sanction of 'in principle' limits for a period of three years with a provision of
timely renewal, preference for grant of packing credit in foreign currency, are
some of the objectives of the Gold Card Scheme for exporters. The Gold Card
holders, on the basis of their track record of timely realisation of export bills, will
also be considered for issuance of foreign currency credit cards for meeting
urgent payment obligations.
It may be recalled that the Ministry of Commerce and Industry had
indicated in the Exim Policy 2003-04 announced on January 28, 2004 that the
Reserve Bank of India will work out a Gold Card Scheme for credit worthy
exporters with a good track record for easy availability of export credit on best
terms. Accordingly, as announced in paragraph 92 of the Annual Policy
Statement for 2004-05 on May 18, 2004, the Reserve Bank has, in consultation
with select banks and exporters, has drawn up a Gold Card Scheme.
