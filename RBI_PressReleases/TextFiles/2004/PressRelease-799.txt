committees/groups formed among RBI, SEBI and IRDA, as per its directions,
meet frequently to discuss and sort out issues relating to capital market exposure
of regulated entities and developments in the financial markets having
implications cutting across different regulators.  Actions taken by these sub-
committees are reported to HLCCFCM for further deliberations.
Today’s meeting focused on issues relating to, among other things,
investment in overseas index funds and inter-regulatory co-ordination in stock
market related developments.  Recent developments in the capital market were
