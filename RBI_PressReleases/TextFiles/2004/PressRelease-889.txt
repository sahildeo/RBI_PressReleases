Defaulters' lists now on CIBIL website
The Reserve Bank of India has entrusted the work of publishing the lists of defaulters (suit
filed accounts) of Rs. 1 crore and above, as also, willful defaulters (suit filed accounts) of Rs.25 lakh
and above, to the Credit Information Bureau (India) Ltd. (CIBIL). CIBIL, and not the Reserve Bank, will
disseminate these as on March 31, 2003 and onwards. The lists will, therefore, be displayed on the
CIBIL website (www.cibil.com) and not on the Reserve Bank website.
Correspondence, if any, relating to both the defaulters' list may, in future, be addressed to
CIBIL/concerned banks/financial institutions.
The Reserve Bank of India will, however, continue to deal with the data relating to non-suit
filed accounts of the defaulters lists of Rs.1 crore and above and willful defaulters of Rs.25 lakh and
above, which are disseminated only to banks/financial institutions for their confidential use.
