January 2, 2004 Prepayment of Foreign Currency Loans Taking into account the strong foreign exchange position and interest rates prevailing in the domestic market, the Government of India has repaid a portion of bilateral foreign currency loans amounting to USD 576.84 million (Rs. 2,615.98 crore) and currency pool loans of World Bank amounting to USD 1437.05 million (Rs. 6,517 crore) during the period of October 2003 to December 2003. These repayments were made by the Government by purchasing the necessary foreign currencies from the Reserve Bank of India at the prevailing exchange rate. The Government has now decided to prepay some more bilateral foreign currency loans (from Italy) amounting to USD 93.61 million (approximately) by purchasing the foreign currency from the Reserve Bank of India at prevailing exchange rate. All of the above prepayments will be made by issuing two dated securities, viz., 4.69 per cent Government Stock 2008 for Rs.6,500 crore and 5.64 per cent Government Stock 2019 for Rs.3,000 crore to the Reserve Bank of India on a private placement basis on January 2, 2004. Any residual requirement of rupees will be met out of Government's cash holding. Since the fresh rupee borrowings by the government (through private placements with the Reserve Bank of India) will be used exclusively to match an equivalent amount of debts in foreign currency already retired/being retired, with equivalent residual maturity, the transactions will not have any implications on aggregated debt position of the Government. The monetary impact of the additional borrowing, through private placement, will be neutralised by equivalent Rupee payment (including the payments already made) by Government of India to Reserve Bank of India towards the purchase of foreign exchange. The cumulative reduction in the Reserve Bank's foreign exchange assets will be matched by a corresponding increase in the domestic assets in the form of Government securities acquired by way of private placements.
