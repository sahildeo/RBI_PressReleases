Exchange Facility for Public
With a view to facilitate the availability of notes and coins of all
denominations to the public, the Reserve Bank of India has made special
arrangements for distribution of notes and coins through the branches of Bank of
Baroda as shown in the annexure.
In order to make available clean currency notes to public in adequate
quantity, the Reserve Bank has taken several steps in the recent past. These
include making arrangements with the postal authorities in Mumbai for
distribution of coins through the post offices in Maharashtra and Goa and
opening one currency chest branch on one Sunday in a month at selected
centres to exclusively provide currency exchange and distribution of small coins
and suck out the bad notes.
