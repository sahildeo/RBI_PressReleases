April 17, 2004 Trade Credits for Imports into India ­ Review and Simplification The Reserve Bank has reviewed the present instructions on credits for imports in the light of experience gained and recent developments. Consequently, it is clarified that the extant guidelines covering such credits for imports of all items (permissible under the EXIM Policy) up to USD 20 million per import transaction with a maturity period up to one year remain unchanged. Credits up to USD 20 million per import transaction with a maturity period exceeding one year but less than three years would now be permitted only for import of capital goods. The reporting arrangements for such credits have been further simplified. Since September 27, 2002, ADs were permitted to approve Short-Term Credit (STC) up to USD 20 million per import transaction for a period less than three years (vide A.P. (DIR Series) Circular No. 25 dated September 27, 2002). STC exceeding USD 20 million per import transaction required prior approval of the Reserve Bank. The revised guidelines on trade credits for imports into India are being released on RBI website separately.
