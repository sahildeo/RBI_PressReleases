The policy for overseas investment has been liberalized to allow Indian 
corporates/registered partnership firms to invest in joint ventures (JVs)/ wholly 
owned subsidiaries (WOSs) overseas upto 100 per cent of their networth without 
any separate monetary ceiling. The existing policy required applicants to obtain 
specific approval from the Reserve Bank of India for making investment 
exceeding USD 100 million (USD 10 million for partnership firms) even when 
their networth exceeded the monetary ceiling.

to undertake agricultural activities either directly or through an overseas branch. 
Such investments were so far permitted only through an overseas joint venture or

Indian companies to take advantage of global opportunities and also to acquire 
technological and other skills for adoption back home in India.
