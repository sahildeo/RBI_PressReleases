First Meeting of
Advisory Committee on Administered Interest Rates
The first meeting of the Advisory Committee on Administered Interest
Rates was held in the Reserve Bank of India today under the Chairmanship of
Dr. Rakesh Mohan, Deputy Governor. The members of the Committee who
attended the meeting were Dr. Ashok Lahiri, Chief Economic Advisor, Ministry of
Finance, Government of India, Shri D. Swarup, Secretary (Expenditure &
Budget), Ministry of Finance, Government of India, Dr. Suman Bery, Director
General, National Council for Applied Economic Research and Prof. Mihir
Rakshit, Director, Monetary Research Project, Investment Information and Credit
Rating Agency of India.
The Committee reviewed the progress of implementation of the
recommendations of the earlier Expert Committee on Administered Interest
Rates. The Committee noted that considerable progress has been made in the
implementation of the earlier Committee's recommendations which were
accepted in principle by the Government. As per the recommendation of the
earlier Committee, now the entire proceeds of small savings are being
transferred to the State Governments. Interest rates on small savings have
increasingly been aligned to market interest rates. 
The Committee decided to deliberate on rationalisation of the number of
small savings instruments offered by the Government at present and on tax
treatment on such schemes with a view to coming out with a roadmap.
The Committee will meet again to continue its deliberations.
