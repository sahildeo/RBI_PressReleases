Coins of all denominations are legal tenders - RBI advice
The Reserve Bank of India has come across news reports and has also received
complaints that shopkeepers, traders, transport undertakings, Government Departments,
etc., do not readily accept 25 paise and 50 paise coins on the plea that these coins are
no more legal tender or they are not accepted by bank branches.
It is clarified for the benefit of public that all coins including 25 paise and 50 paise
coins are legal tenders and will continue to be so. Reluctance on the part of any one to
accept the coins, is, therefore, not correct. The Reserve Bank has advised all
commercial banks to freely accept all the coins for exchange into banknotes. The
Reserve Bank offices will also continue to freely accept all the coins for exchange into
banknotes.
