RBI asks Banks to  increase Margins for Advances against Shares 
The Reserve Bank of India, on a review, has today decided to 
increase, with immediate effect, margins on all advances against 
shares/IPOs/issue of guarantees from 40% to 50%.  It has also advised banks 
to raise the minimum cash margin of 20% to 25%.   
It may be recalled that the margin in respect of advance against 
shares/financing of IPOs/issue of guarantees was reduced from the level of 
50% to 40% and the minimum cash margin from 25% to 20% in May 2004.
