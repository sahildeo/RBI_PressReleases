2004 and resumed the seasonal upturn that typically begins in September;
cumulative export growth during April-September 2004 has exceeded the annual

1
(i.e., April-June 2004), soared in Q (i.e., July-September 2004) recording a
2
growth of 53.5 per cent on a year-on-year basis.
• Imports of POL (crude petroleum and products) were the key drivers of the surge
in import payments, with data of the Directorate General of Commercial
Intelligence and Statistics (DGCI&S) indicating a rise of 58.1 per cent in Q on
2
top of a growth of 57.6 per cent in Q . The sharp rise in POL imports reflected
1
the impact of the elevated levels of international crude oil prices (US $ 32-41 per
barrel for the Dubai variety in Q against US $ 29-35 in Q) and an increase of
2 1
12.7 per cent in volume up to August 2004.

• DGCI&S data indicate that non-POL imports posted an increase of 22.2 per cent
in Q after expanding by 29.5 per cent in Q on the back of the firming up of
2 1
industrial activity.  Strong correlation with the index of industrial production at the
turning points suggests that non-POL imports are a leading indicator of industrial
activity.

1
transportation, insurance, communication, financial and other business services
and private transfers contributing to this decline.
• Tourist interest in India remained strong with international tourist traffic rising by
26 per cent in the first half of 2004-05.
• Software exports remained buoyant in Q , broadly maintaining the level achieved
2
in Q 2004-05.

• The massive expansion in the trade deficit during Q 2004-05 and decline in the
2
net invisible surplus turned the current account into a deficit of US $ 6.4 billion
after a run of surpluses which began in Q 2003-04. For the first half of 2004-05,
2
the current account recorded a deficit of US $ 3.3 billion, which reflected the
strengthening of investment demand and industrial activity.

• Among the components of capital flows (net), external commercial borrowings
(ECBs) and short-term credit moderated while there were outflows under
banking capital in Q .
2
• Disbursements of ECBs and short-term credit to India in Q rose significantly on
2
a year-on-year basis - 69 per cent and 25 per cent, respectively - in association
with the pick up in import demand, but a sharp rise in repayments restrained net
inflows even in relation to Q 2004-05.

• NRI deposits continued to register net outflows as in April-June 2004 responding
to alignment of interest rates on these deposits with international interest rates.

• Developments in the current and capital accounts of the BoP resulted in a draw
down of the foreign exchange reserves of the order of US $ 634 million,
excluding valuation effects, after 15 quarters. Over the first half of 2004-05,
however, there was an accretion to the reserves of US $ 6.9 billion, excluding
valuation changes. At US $ 119.6 billion at the end of September 2004, India
held the sixth largest stock of reserves in the world.
