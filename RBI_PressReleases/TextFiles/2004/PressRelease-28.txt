RBI activates Relief Measures through Banks
In States affected by Tsunami
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has today activated its relief package
for the States affected by Tsunami.  Bank branches are required to initiate the
package of measures immediately after the district/state authorities declare
the district/State as calamity affected area and to provide financial assistance
to the agriculturists, small scale industrial units, artisans, small businesses
and trading establishments affected by natural calamities.
The measures include consumption loans to persons affected by
calamities for sustenance, waiver of margin requirements or considering as
margin the grants, subsidies provided by state governments, provision of
credit not only to existing borrowers but also to other eligible persons within
the jurisdiction of bank branch and who is not covered by any other financial
intermediary as also conversion and rescheduling/restructuring of existing
loans in the case of crop failure due to natural calamities.  The package also
includes providing to affected persons term loans for developmental
purposes. Further, banks while using their discretion on charging of interest
are required to view such cases sympathetically and consider waiving of
penal interest to be charged for default of current dues and deferment of
compounding of interest. In addition, the banks have been asked to
expeditiously restore banking services in the affected areas.
The Reserve Bank has asked the banks to convene a State Level
Bankers Committee meeting immediately to discuss the effect of Tsunami in
their respective areas and to consider and recommend any special measures
that might be required in the affected states in addition to the Reserve Bank's
relief package.  The Reserve Bank has also asked its Regional Directors in
the affected states to coordinate with the State Governments in this matter.
The Reserve Bank is also taking special measures to ensure the
movements and adequate supply of currency notes in these areas.
A Task Force comprising Deputy Governor, Shri V Leeladhar
(Chairman) and Shri G Srinivasan, Chief General Manager, Rural Planning
and Credit Department (Member Secretary) and some senior executives of
the Reserve Bank has been formed to monitor the progress of relief and
rehabilitation measures through the banks and to constantly review the
situation to see if any further measures are required to give relief to the
affected states.2
