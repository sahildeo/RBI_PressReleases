Quarterly Indicative Schedule for Issuance of TBills/ Bonds under MSS
A quarterly indicative schedule for issuance of Treasury Bills/dated securities under
MSS covering the period from October 1, 2004 to December 31, 2004 has been drawn up in
consultation with the Government of India. The indicative schedule is as under:
Indicative Schedule for October 1, 2004 to December 31, 2004)
Period Nature of Instrument Auction Amount

(ii) 364-Day Treasury Bill Rs. 1,000 crore
December 1, 2004 91-Day Treasury Bill Rs. 1,500 crore
(i) 91-Day Treasury Bill Rs. 1,500 crore
December 8, 2004 (ii) 364-Day Treasury Bill Rs. 1,000 crore
December 15, 2004 91-Day Treasury Bill Rs. 1,500 crore
December 22, 2004 (i) 91-Day Treasury Bill Rs. 1,500 crore
(ii) 364-Day Treasury Bill Rs. 1,000 crore
December 29, 2004 91-Day Treasury Bill Rs. 1,500 crore
Total Rs. 25,500 crore
As was notified in the earlier quarterly schedule, the issuance of Treasury Bills under
the MSS will be undertaken by increasing the notified amounts for the regular auctions of 91-
day and 364-day Treasury Bills.  Thus, the issuances under MSS covered by the above
quarterly indicative schedule will be undertaken in addition to the regular issuances of
Treasury Bills and dated securities.
 The issuance of 91-day Treasury Bills in this quarter will essentially be the roll over of
91-day Treasury Bills issued in the quarter July-September 2004. However, on account of
certain shortfall in the absorption under MSS, the net proposed issuance of 91-day treasury
Bills will be around Rs. 2,500 (face value) crore. The absorption in the 364-day Treasury Bills2
is proposed to be Rs. 6,000 crore (face value) as there is no redemption of 364-day Treasury
Bills issued under MSS earlier.
 The above indicative schedule is subject to variations depending on market
conditions and other relevant factors. In addition to the proposed issuances indicated in the
schedule, the Reserve Bank will also have the flexibility for additional issuances of Treasury
Bills and dated securities depending upon the prevailing liquidity conditions and other relevant
factors.
 It may be recalled that on March 25, 2004 a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU)
between the Government of India and the Reserve Bank of India was signed for launching of
MSS. The scheme was launched through a system of releasing quarterly indicative schedules
for issuances of Treasury Bills/dated securities under MSS. So far, under the scheme two
indicative quarterly schedules have been released on March 25, 2004 and June 29, 2004.
The current indicative schedule for October-December 2004 quarter is in continuation of the
earlier schedules.
