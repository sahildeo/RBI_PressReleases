RBI Increases Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) for Scheduled Banks
On a review of current liquidity conditions, it has been decided to increase CRR of
scheduled commercial banks, regional rural banks (RRBs), scheduled state co-operative
banks and scheduled primary (urban) co-operative banks by one-half of one percentage
point of their net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) in two stages, effective from fortnights
as indicated below:
Effective date (i.e. the CRR on net demand and
fortnight beginning from) time liabilities (per cent)
September 18, 2004 4.75
October 2, 2004 5.0
Further, with effect from the fortnight beginning September 18, 2004, banks will be
paid interest at the rate of 3.5 per cent per annum on their eligible cash balances
maintained with RBI under CRR requirement as against the current practice of payment of
interest at the Bank Rate (6.0 per cent per annum). The payment of interest on monthly
basis will continue as at present.
The above measures are consistent with the present stance of monetary policy to
meet credit growth and to support investment and export demand, given the current liquidity
conditions.
As indicated in the annual monetary and credit policy Statement of 2002-03, the
Reserve Bank will continue to pursue its medium-term objective of reducing CRR to its
statutory minimum of 3.0 per cent, while retaining the option to use the CRR in both
directions for liquidity management, as and when essential, in addition to other instruments.
As regards remuneration of eligible cash balances under CRR, it may be recalled that
the Internal Group on Liquidity Adjustment Facility (December 2003) had recommended
that “with substantial scaling down of CRR coupled with marked decline in overall interest
rate structure in the economy and increasing liquidity needs of participants in the wake of
higher interlinkages among different segments of the market, the degree to which CRR had
been impacting banks as an implicit taxation earlier is considerably less in recent period.
Accordingly, the remuneration of eligible cash balances at the Bank Rate is no longer
justifiable and the remuneration of CRR, if any, be delinked from the Bank Rate and placed
at a rate lower than the repo rate”.
