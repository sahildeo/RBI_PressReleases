South Gujarat LAB to function as Branches of BoB from June 25
All branches of the South Gujarat Local Area Bank Ltd., will function as
branches of Bank of Baroda from June 25, 2004. This is as per the Scheme of
Amalgamation which will come into force from this date. The scheme, as
sanctioned by the Government of India, fully protects the depositors' interests.
As per the Scheme of Amalgamation, after first evaluating the assets
and liabilities of the South Gujarat Local Area Bank Ltd., Bank of Baroda will
takeover its assets and liabilities and pay the depositors and creditors to the
extent of their balances. If any surplus remains after paying off the depositors
and creditors, the shareholders of the bank will be entitled for payment only of
pro rata value of shares. Importantly, the Scheme of Amalgamation does not
envisage allotment of shares of Bank of Baroda to the shareholders of the
South Gujarat Local Area Bank Ltd.
It may be recalled that on application from the Reserve Bank of India,
the Central Government had made an Order of Moratorium on the South
Gujarat Local Area Bank Ltd. The moratorium was made effective from the
close of business on May 13, 2004 up to and inclusive of August 12, 2004.
During the period of moratorium, the Reserve Bank of India prepared a draft
scheme of amalgamation of the South Gujarat Local Area Bank Ltd. with Bank
of Baroda. The Central Government today issued the notification sanctioning
the scheme of amalgamation. The Scheme of Amalgamation will come into
force with effect from June 25, 2004.
Set up in October 2000, as a local area bank (LAB) the South Gujarat
Local Area Bank Ltd., has seven branches located in three districts of Gujarat.
