April 10, 2004 Forex Reserves includes India's RTP in the IMF In keeping with the international best practice, the Reserve Bank of India has, from the week ended April 2, 2004, included India's reserve position in the International Monetary Fund (IMF), called the Reserve Tranche Position (RTP) in the foreign exchange reserves. The data are published in April 10, 2004 issue of the Weekly Statistical Supplement to the Reserve Bank of India Bulletin released today. Foreign assets held in the form of Reserve Tranche Position (RTP) with the IMF are akin to other components of foreign exchange reserves and are given a rate of return by the IMF. They can also be used, when required, to deal with any balance of payments needs. The IMF includes RTP as part of a member country's international reserves. To impart full transparency, the RTP with the IMF was introduced as a `memo item' in Table 2 on Foreign Exchange Reserves in the Weekly Statistical Supplement to the Reserve Bank of India Bulletin, from the week ended May 23, 2003 (published on May 31, 2003) to March 26, 2004. It may be recalled that India was selected to become a member of the Financial Transaction Plan (FTP) of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) from the quarter September-November, 2002 in view of its strong balance of payments and comfortable foreign exchange reserves position. (For further details, please see Press Release:1328 of June 28, 2003). The Reserve Tranche Position (RTP) of the Government of India with the IMF changes from time to time, due to both India's transactions under the FTP, and changes in SDR exchange rates vis-à-vis the rupee and the US dollar.
