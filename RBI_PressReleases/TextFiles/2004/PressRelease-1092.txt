March 31, 2004 Developments Relating to Balance of Payments during October-December 2003 Preliminary data on balance of payments (BoP) for the quarter October-December 2003 are presented in the attached tables along with data for the first two quarters of 2003-04 (April-June and July-September, 2003) revised to take into account the latest available information on merchandise trade, invisibles and various components of capital transactions. October-December 2003 The salient features of BoP developments during October-December, 2003 are set out below. Current Account  On a payments basis, the merchandise trade deficit widened to US $ 5.6 billion from US $ 4.2 billion in the previous quarter (July-September 2003) and US $ 4.4 billion in October-December, 2002.  The higher trade deficit in October-December, 2003 reflected a strong pick up in import payments in relation to the previous quarters of the year. Export growth was particularly robust in December 2003 but this could only offset partially the rise in import payments during the quarter.  The invisible account recorded a net surplus of US $ 7.4 billion in OctoberDecember, 2003 as against US $ 5.8 billion in July-September, 2003 and US $ 5.3 billion in October-December, 2002.  Gross invisible receipts maintained a rising profile as in the rest of the year, mainly on account of the continuing growth of inward remittances recorded under private transfers, the resilience of software exports recorded in the miscellaneous account and a surge in earnings from tourism.  Invisible payments were lower in relation to the previous quarters, particularly under travel and business and technology-related payments booked under the miscellaneous account.  Investment income payments surged in the quarter on account of interest payments relating to the redeemed Resurgent India Bonds (RIBs).  The current account recorded a surplus of US $ 1.8 billion in October-December 2003, marginally higher than US $ 1.6 billion recorded in the previous quarter. In October-December 2002, the current account had recorded a surplus of US $ 0.9 billion. Capital Account  Net capital flows fell to US $ 5.9 billion in October-December 2003 from US $ 6.1 billion in the previous quarter on account of prepayment of multilateral and bilateral debt by the Government of India (US $ 2 billion) and redemption of RIBs (US $ 4.2 billion, excluding accrued interest).
