RBI re-sets rate of interest on FRBs 2006
The rate of interest on the Floating Rate Bonds, 2006 (FRB, 2006) applicable for
the half-year November 22, 2004 to May 21, 2005 shall be 5.37 per cent per annum.
It may be recalled that in the auction held on November 21, 2001, the rate of
interest on the FRB, 2006 was set at a mark-up over and above the variable base rate.
The variable base rate for payment of interest was to be the average rate (rounded off
up to two decimal places) of the implicit yields at cut-off prices of the last six auctions of
Government of India 364-day Treasury Bills held up to the commencement of the
respective half-yearly coupon period. The mark-up decided in the auction held on
November 21, 2001 was (-) 0.05 (minus 0.05).
The variable base rate based on the average rate of the implicit yields at cut-off
prices of the last six auctions of Government of India 364-day Treasury Bills worked out
to be 5.42 per cent. The coupon rate has, thus, worked out to be 5.37 per cent.
