Sources of Accretion to Foreign Exchange Reserves in India:
2004-05 (April-June)
Background
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had, on January 31, 2003, issued a Press Note on
conclusions of a study conducted by its Department of Economic Analysis and Policy (DEAP)
on Sources of Accretion to Foreign Exchange Reserves during April-November 2002.
Subsequent to this, the RBI has been regularly updating and releasing information on
‘Sources of Accretion to Foreign Exchange Reserves’ through press releases which are
available on the RBI website (www.rbi.org.in).
Balance of payments (BoP) data for the quarter April-June 2004-05 are now
available. These data have been released on RBI website on September 30, 2004.

The following table shows the main components of accretion to foreign exchange

Table 1: Sources of Accretion to Foreign Exchange Reserves
(US $ billion)
Items 2004-05 2003-04
I. Current Account Balance 1.9 -0.6
II. Capital Account (net) 5.6 6.1
(a to f)
a. Foreign Investment 1.3 2.1

     Of which: NRI Deposits -0.8 1.8
c. Short term credit 1.6 0.9
d. External Assistance 0.1 -0.3
e. External Commercial Borrowings 1.2 0.4
f. Other items in capital account 0.3 1.1
III. Valuation change -1.0 1.6
Total (I+II+III) 6.5 7.1
Major sources of accretion to foreign exchange reserves during April-June, 2004-05
have been:
• The current account surplus amounting to US $ 1.9 billion during April-June 2004 as
compared with a deficit of US $ 0.6 billion during April-June 2003.
• Foreign investment (20.0 per cent); comprising FDI (18.5 per cent) and portfolio
investment (1.5 per cent);
• Banking capital, (which includes NRI deposits) at 16.9 per cent;
• Short-term credit (24.6 per cent);• Other items under capital account which mainly reflect the difference between customs
data on imports/exports and banking channel data (US $ 2.4 billion), external
assistance (US $ 72 million), rupee debt service (US $ -277 million) and other
transactions, accounted for 4.6 per cent;
• Valuation loss in reserves of US $ 1.0 billion (15.4 per cent).
Valuation changes, reflecting the depreciation of the Euro, GBP and Yen against the US
dollar, accounted for a decline of US $ 1.0 billion in the total reserves during April-June 2004-
05 as against a valuation gain of US $ 1.6 billion in the corresponding period of 2003-04.
While the Reserve Bank denominates its forex reserves in terms of US dollars, these
comprise a basket of major international currencies, particularly US dollar, Euro and Pound
Sterling. Accordingly, when non-US dollar currencies appreciate vis-à-vis the US dollar, there
is an accretion to reserves by way of valuation gains. The reverse is the case when these
currencies depreciate against the US dollar.
