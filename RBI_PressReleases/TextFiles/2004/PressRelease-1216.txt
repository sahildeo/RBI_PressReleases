March 1, 2004 Auditors for Public Sector Banks : Revised Empanelment/Categorisation Norms to be effective 2004-05 The Reserve Bank of India had decided to put into effect revised empanelment/categorisation norms for audit firms to be considered as statutory central/branch auditors of 27 public sector banks with effect from the year 2004-2005. On representation from the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India, New Delhi it has now been decided to defer the implementation of the revised norms for a period of one year. Accordingly, the new norms will now come into force with effect from 2005-2006 instead of 20042005. Similarly, the decision to prepare a panel of statutory branch auditors for 27 public sector banks once in two years effective from 2004-2005 has also been deferred for a period of one year. Accordingly, the statutory branch auditors panel that would be prepared for the year 20042005 would remain in force for that year only and from the year 2005-2006 and onwards, such panel would be prepared once in two years.
