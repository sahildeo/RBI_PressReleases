RBI releases Comprehensive Policy Framework for
Ownership and Governance of Private Banks for Feedback
            The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has formulated a draft comprehensive
policy framework in regard to the ownership and governance of private sector
banks.  This is placed in public domain for discussion and feedback before
finalising.
           It may be recalled that in paragraph 68 of the Annual Policy Statement for
2004-05 announced on May 18, 2004, the Governor had indicated that keeping
in view the special nature of banks, it is necessary to articulate in a
comprehensive and transparent manner the policy in regard to ownership and
governance of both, public and private sector banks.
          It may be noted that the Reserve Bank had, on June 25, 2004, advised
private sector banks that they should undertake a process of due diligence to
determine the “fit and proper” status of persons for appointment as director on
the board and ensure that in public interest the directors execute the deed of
covenant as recommended by the Ganguly Group. The circular is available on
the RBI website (www.rbi.org.in)
