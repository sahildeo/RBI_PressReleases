6. The Floating Rate Bonds will be of 12-year tenure and will be issued at par. (i.e., at

'spread' to a variable base rate. The 'spread'   will be decided in the auction to be
conducted by Reserve Bank of India and will remain unchanged during the currency of
the bonds. The variable base rate will be the average rate of the implicit yields at cut-off
prices emerging in the immediate previous three auctions of ‘Government of India 364
day Treasury Bills’ held prior to the relative annual coupon reset period. The interest will
be paid every half year.  The base rate for calculation of interest for the first coupon
period commencing from May 7. 2004 to May 6. 2005 as per the aforesaid formula is
4.45 per cent (please see the enclosed illustration). The base rate for the subsequent
annual coupon periods, worked out as per the aforesaid formula, will be announced by
RBI on or before the commencement of the respective coupon reset period.
7. The payment for the stock by the successful bidders in the auction will include accrued
interest on the nominal value of the Stock from the date of last interest payment date, i.e.,
March 25, 2004 to May 6, 2004 at 6.01 per cent.
8. The bonds will be repaid at par on May 7, 2016 and the stock will be repaid on March 25,
2028.
9. There will be no floor or cap on the interest rate on the Floating Rate Bonds.
10. In the unlikely event of 364-day Treasury Bill auctions being discontinued during the
currency of the FRB, the applicable variable base rate will be the average of the Yield to
Maturity (YTM) rate prevailing for one year Government of India Security as on last three
reporting Fridays prior to the commencement of the relative annual coupon period
worked out in consultation with the Fixed Income Money Market and Derivatives
Association of India (FIMMDA). In case particular Friday/s is/are holiday/s, the yield to
maturity rates on the previous working day shall be taken. This rate will be announced by
RBI on or before the commencement of the relative annual coupon period.
11. It may be recalled that the issuance calendar for the marketable dated securities for first
half of 2004-05 notified on March 25, 2004 provides that about 10 to 20 per cent of the
total issuances by Government of India will be in the form of Floating Rate Bonds. Such
bonds provide hedge against interest rate risk, offering returns linked to short term yield.
12. For any further clarifications, interested investors may approach the Chief General
Manager-in-Charge, Reserve Bank of India, IDM Department, Central Office, Mumbai.Illustration:
