RBI releases Status Paper on Commercial Paper Market in India for
Comments
The Reserve Bank of India today placed the status paper on
Commercial Paper (CP) Market in India on its website. Inviting comments on
the Report by August 14, 2004, it has stated that they may be forwarded to
Principal Monetary Policy Adviser, Monetary Policy Department, Reserve
Bank of India, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Mumbai 400 001
[Fax: (91-22) 2265 1685/2269 3204; email: helpmpd@rbi.org.in].
CPs are negotiable short-term unsecured promissory notes with fixed
maturities, issued by well rated companies generally sold on discount basis
and mature at par.  For many large, creditworthy issuers, CP is a low-cost
alternative to bank loans from a large pool of institutional buyers.  Investors in
CP earn competitive, market-determined yields whose maturity and amounts
can be tailored to their specific needs.
The guidelines of CP had been reviewed from time to time but major
changes were effected last in October 2000.  Since then, the market
participants have been suggesting various modifications in the guidelines for
further deepening of the CP market.  In this context, an attempt has been
made here to review the status of development of CP market in a cross-
country perspective and suggest measures for further developing this market.
The status paper on CP Market in India was placed in the nineteenth
meeting of the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) on Money, Foreign
Exchange and Government Securities Markets on May 31, 2004 with
Dr. Rakesh Mohan, Deputy Governor in the Chair. In the meeting, various
issues affecting the further development of the CP market and suggestions
given by Monetary Policy Department were discussed.
