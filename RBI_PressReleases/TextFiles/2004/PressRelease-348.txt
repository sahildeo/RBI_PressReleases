• Merchandise export growth in the first quarter of 2004-05 was robust and well above
the target of 16 per cent in US dollar terms set for the year.
• Merchandise imports surged, reflecting the soaring of international crude oil prices to
a range of US $ 28-36 per barrel (Dubai Light) and strong demand for raw materials,
intermediates and finished products on the back of the firming up of industrial activity.
• The trade deficit of US $ 6.3 billion on a balance of payments basis was the highest in
any quarter so far.Exports, Imports and Trade Balance in

Software Travel Private Transfers
• A sharp rise in invisibles payments in relation to April-June 2003 was on account of
growth in outbound tourist traffic, transportation and insurance payments associated
with merchandise trade and expanding demand for imports of business services such
as business and management consultancy, engineering, technical and distribution
services which are recorded in the miscellaneous account of invisibles.

• Net capital flows at US $ 5.6 billion were driven mainly by external commercial
borrowings (ECBs), short-term trade credits on account of substantially higher crude
oil imports, and foreign direct investment.
• Net outflows were recorded by foreign institutional investors ( FIIs), reflecting the
generally subdued appetite for Asian markets. However, there was a marginal net
inflow under portfolio investment due to ADRs/GDRs.
• NRI deposits registered net outflows responding to alignment of interest rates on
these deposits with rates of return in the international market.
• Banks in India increased their recourse to overseas borrowings and drew down
foreign currency assets held abroad.
