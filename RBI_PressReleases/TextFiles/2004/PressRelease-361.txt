BIS' Triennial Central Bank Survey on Foreign
Exchange and Derivatives Market Activity
The Bank for International Settlement (BIS), Basel, Switzerland, has been conducting a global survey on foreign
exchange and derivatives market activity since 1998. The survey is conducted every three years with the help of the central
bank of the participating countries. The objective of the survey is to obtain comprehensive and internationally consistent
information on the size and structure of the foreign exchange and derivatives market. The survey aims at increasing market
transparency, helping the central banks, other authorities and market participants to monitor patterns of activity in the global
financial system.
India participates in the survey through the Reserve Bank of India. The first such survey was conducted in 1998
and the next survey was conducted in 2001. Third such survey has been conducted now with 52 central banks and
monetary authorities collecting data on turnover of foreign exchange transactions (spot, outright forward and foreign
exchange swaps) as well as over-the-counter currency and interest rate derivatives.
The information on these activities relates to the month of April 2004 and covers about 79 per cent of the market
activity.
The findings of the global and India surveys are posted on the RBI website www.rbi.org.in and BIS website
