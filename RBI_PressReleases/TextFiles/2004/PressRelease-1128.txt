March 25, 2004 Revised Scheme of LAF and Rationalisation of Standing Liquidity Facilities for Banks for Export Credit and PDs Following its announcement in the mid-term Review of Monetary and Credit Policy for the year 2003-04 in November 3, 2003, the "Report of the Internal Group on Liquidity Adjustment Facility" was placed on the RBI website on December 2, 2003 for wider dissemination and comments. Thereafter, the Report was discussed extensively with market participants and experts. Apart from comments received during these deliberations, contributions were also received from various banks, self-regulatory organisations and individuals representing professional and academic bodies. Taking into account the recommendations of the Internal Group and the suggestions from the market participants and experts, it has been decided to revise the LAF scheme. Further, in the light of the revised LAF scheme, it has also been decided to rationalise the standing liquidity facilities for banks for export credit and PDs. The revised LAF scheme and the standing liquidity facilities coming into effect from March 29, 2004 will have the following features: I. Revised LAF Scheme

(i) Tenor The revised LAF Scheme will be operationalised through (i) 7-day fixed rate repo conducted daily and (ii) overnight fixed rate reverse repo conducted daily, on week days. However, in order to achieve smooth transition to the revised Scheme, the existing overnight variable rate repo auction facility with the existing features would also be available to eligible market participants upto April 2, 2004. Thereafter, the overnight repo auction will be discontinued and only the 7-day repo auction will be available. Further, in order to enable market participants to meet their prior commitments based on their existing operations, the 14-day repo, conducted on a fortnightly interval, would also continue with the existing features. The 14-day repo will, however, be phased out in due course.
