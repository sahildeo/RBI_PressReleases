External Commercial Borrowings (ECB)
for Overseas Direct Investment/
Mergers and Acquisitions
It has been decided to permit eligible resident corporates to raise external
commercial borrowings (ECB) for overseas direct investment in Joint Ventures
(JV) /Wholly Owned Subsidiaries (WOS). This will include mergers and
acquisitions of overseas companies.
With a view to enable Indian corporates to become global players by
facilitating their overseas direct investment, permitted end-use for ECB is
enlarged to include overseas direct investment in Joint Ventures (JV)/Wholly
Owned Subsidiaries (WOS). This would facilitate corporates to undertake fresh
investment or expansion of existing JV/WOS including mergers and acquisitions
abroad by harnessing resources at globally competitive rates.
 Operational guidelines are being issued to Authorised Dealers.
