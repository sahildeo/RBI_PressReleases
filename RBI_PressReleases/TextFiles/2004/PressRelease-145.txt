RBI announces rate of interest on FRBs 2009
The rate of interest on the Floating Rate Bonds, 2009 (FRB, 2009) applicable half
year (December 6, 2004 to June 5, 2005) shall be 5.52 percent per annum.
It may be recalled that the rate of interest on the FRB, 2009 was set at a mark-up
(as decided in the auction held on December 5, 2001) over and above the variable base
rate. The variable base rate for payment of interest shall be the average rate (rounded
off up to two decimal places) of the implicit yields on actual/364 day-count convention,
corresponding to the cut-off prices of the last six auctions of Government of India 364
day Treasury Bills held up to the commencement of the respective half yearly coupon
period. The variable base rate based on the average rate of the implicit yields at cut-off
prices of the said last six auctions of Government of India 364 day Treasury Bills works
out to be 5.53 per cent. The mark-up decided in the auction held on December 5, 2001
was (-) 0.01 (minus 0.01). The coupon rate has been fixed accordingly.
