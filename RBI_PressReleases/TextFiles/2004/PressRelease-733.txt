The Floating Rate Bonds will be of 11-year tenure and will be issued at par.
(i.e., at Rs. 100.00 per cent).  The bonds will carry an interest rate, which is calculated
by adding a 'spread' to a variable base rate. The 'spread'   will be decided in the
auction to be conducted by Reserve Bank of India and will remain unchanged during
the currency of the bonds. The variable base rate will be the average rate of the2
implicit yields at cut-off prices emerging in the immediate previous three auctions of
‘Government of India 364 day Treasury Bills’ held prior to the relative annual coupon
reset period. The interest will be paid every half year.  The base rate for calculation of
interest for the first coupon period commencing from July 2, 2004 to July 1, 2005 as
per the aforesaid formula is 4.52 per cent (please see the enclosed illustration). The
base rate for the subsequent annual coupon periods, worked out as per the aforesaid
formula, will be announced by RBI on or before the commencement of the respective
coupon reset period.
The Floating Rate bonds will be repaid at par on July 2, 2015 and the
Government stock will be repaid on June 4, 2028.
There will be no floor or cap on the interest rate on the Floating Rate Bonds.
It may be recalled that the issuance calendar for the marketable dated
securities for first half of 2004-05 notified on March 25, 2004 provides that about 10 to
20 per cent of the total issuances by Government of India will be in the form of Floating
Rate Bonds. Such bonds provide hedge against interest rate risk, offering returns
linked to short term yield.
For any further clarifications, interested investors may approach the Chief
General Manager-in-Charge, Reserve Bank of India, IDM Department, Central Office,
Mumbai.
