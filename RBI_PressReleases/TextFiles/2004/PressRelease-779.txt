Data on Banks' Lending Rates
The Reserve Bank of India today released on its website
(www.rbi.org.in) the data on lending rates of scheduled commercial banks as
on March 31, 2004. The data include the range of actual and median lending
rates of credit of above Rs.2 lakh as well as actual and median lending rates
for export credit in rupee terms. Both these categories of data are available
bank-group wise. An additional table presenting the lending rates of individual
banks for credit above Rs.2 lakh and for export credit in rupee terms is also
presented.
It may be recalled that to enhance transparency in banks' lending rates,
the Reserve Bank of India started publishing the data on its website in
February 2003. Since then it has been regularly updating the data on a
quarterly basis. This was in pursuance of its intention stated in Monetary  and
Credit Policy for 2002-2003 announced in April 2002 of collecting and
publishing lending rates by banks.
