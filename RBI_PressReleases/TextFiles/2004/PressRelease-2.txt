A quarterly indicative schedule for issuance of Treasury Bills/dated
securities under MSS covering the period from January 1, 2005 to March 31,
2005 has been drawn up in consultation with the Government of India. The
indicative schedule is as under:

Period Nature of Instrument Auction Amount
(Indicative)

(ii) 364-Day Treasury Bill Rs. 1,000 crore
Total Rs. 26,500 crore
 2. As was notified in the earlier quarterly schedule, the issuance of Treasury
Bills under the MSS will be undertaken by increasing the notified amounts for the
regular auctions of 91-day and 364-day Treasury Bills.  Thus, the issuances
under MSS covered by the above quarterly indicative schedule will be
undertaken in addition to the regular issuances of Treasury Bills and dated
securities.
3. The issuance of 91-day Treasury Bills in this quarter will essentially be the
roll over of 91-day Treasury Bills issued in the quarter October-December 2004.
However, on account of cancellation of auctions of Treasury Bills under MSS
during the period of November 10, 2004 to December 1, 2004, the net proposed
issuance of 91-day treasury Bills will be Rs. 6,000 crore(face value). The
absorption in the 364-day Treasury Bills is proposed to be Rs. 7,000 crore (face
value) as there is no redemption of 364-day Treasury Bills issued under MSS
earlier.
 4. The above indicative schedule is subject to variations depending on
market conditions and other relevant factors. In addition to the proposed
issuances indicated in the schedule, the Reserve Bank will also have the
flexibility for additional issuances of Treasury Bills and dated securities
depending upon the prevailing liquidity conditions and other relevant factors.
5. It may be recalled that on March 25, 2004 a Memorandum of
Understanding (MoU) between the Government of India and the Reserve Bank of
India was signed for launching of MSS. The scheme was launched through a
system of releasing quarterly indicative schedules for issuances of Treasury
Bills/dated securities under MSS. So far, under the scheme three indicative
quarterly schedules have been released on March 25, 2004, June 29, 2004 and
September 29, 2004. The current indicative schedule for January-March 2005
quarter is in continuation to the earlier schedules.
