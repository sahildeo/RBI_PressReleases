Depositors of Prudential Cooperative Bank to get upto Rs.1 lakh
In view of the fact that the Prudential Cooperative Bank Ltd., Secunderabad,
(Andhra Pradesh) had ceased to be solvent, all efforts to revive it in close consultation
with the Government of Andhra Pradesh had failed and the depositors of the bank were
being inconvenienced by continued uncertainty, the Reserve Bank of India, on
December 7th, delivered the order of cancelling of its licence to the bank.  Immediately
on cancellation of the licence and at the request of the Reserve Bank, the State
Government on December 8, appointed a liquidator for the bank.  This enables all the
depositors of Prudential Cooperative Bank to get their claims upto Rs.1 lakh from the
Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC).  The liquidator has been
requested to expeditiously send the claims of the depositors to DICGC.  Every effort will
be made to complete the formalities within about 90 days to settle the depositors’
claims.
It may be recalled that the Reserve Bank of India decided to cancel the licence of
Prudential Cooperative Bank Ltd., Secunderabad (Andhra Pradesh) as a final step after
examining all the options for revival of the bank and in order to protect the interest of the
depositors.  The Reserve Bank had, after finding the financial position of Prudential
Cooperative Bank precarious in 2002, placed the bank under directions restricting its
operations. The bank, however, continued to face problems. Severe liquidity problems
in March 2003 prompted the Reserve Bank to tighten its directions and supercession of
its Board of Directors. Despite some recoveries, the financial position of the bank
continued to deteriorate.  The reconstruction schemes were also found to be not
feasible in terms of restoring solvency.  The latest inspection of the bank showed that its
deposits were getting eroded as paid-up capital and reserves were in the negative.  The
continuance of the bank was, therefore, untenable.  With the cancellation of its licence
and taking it into liquidation, the process of paying the depositors of Prudential
Cooperative Bank the amount insured as per the DICGC Act will now be set in motion.
