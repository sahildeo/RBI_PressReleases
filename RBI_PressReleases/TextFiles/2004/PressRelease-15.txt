its respective nodal branch of its own bank in New Delhi each day along with

contribution. The nodal branches will in turn remit the funds to any of the 12
designated branches which are maintaining PMNRF account. The banks
which do not have any branch in New Delhi will collect the donations and
remit through a single demand draft or by using the electronic funds transfer
facility to any of the 12 designated branches along with details of the donor,
his address, cheque/draft number and the amount of contribution.

these services free of charge.
