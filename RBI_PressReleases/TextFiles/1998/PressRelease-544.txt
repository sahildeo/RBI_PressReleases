Recent changes in the investment by NRIs/OCBs/FIIs under Portfolio Investment Scheme 
The Reserve Bank of India has revised the lists of companies in which the trigger limits/overall ceiling limits for 
investment by Non-resident Indians (NRIs)/Overseas Corporate Bodies (OCBs)/ Persons of Indian Origin (PIOs) and 
Foreign Institutional Inves tors(FIIs), respectively, have reached.  
It may be recalled that as a measure of further liberalisation, the Government of India, Ministry of Finance had, on June 
22, 1998, announced that the individual and aggregate portfolio investment ceiling for NRIs/OCBs/PIOs will be 
exclusive of the aggregate portfolio investment ceiling for FIIs. The aggregate investment ceiling for NRIs/OCBs/PIOs 
would be 10 per cent of the paid up capital of a company. The investment limit by a single NRI/OCB/PIO in the shares 
of a company under the portfolio investment scheme would continue to be 5 per cent of the paid up capital.  
As such the Reserve Bank will now alert designated banks in respect of investment by NRIs/OCBs/PIOs under the 
portfolio investment scheme in a given company when the holding reaches 8 per cent of the company's paid up capital. 
Banks will have to take prior permission for making further purchases of shares of the company on behalf of their 
NRI/OCB/PIO clients. The ban letter prohibiting further purchases by NRIs/OCBs/PIOs will be issued once the holding 
in the company reaches 10 per cent of the company's paid up capital. All designated banks have to mandatorily report 
the purchase and sale transactions in LEC(NRI) state ments immediately.  
FII investment would continue to be subject to a separate aggregate ceiling of 24 per cent and 30 per cent of the paid 
up capital of a company.
