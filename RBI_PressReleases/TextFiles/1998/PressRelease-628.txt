Investment by FIIs/NRIs/OCBs under the Portfolio Investment Scheme - 
Monitoring of ceiling 
The Reserve Bank of India has withdrawn the restrictions placed on the purchase of 
shares of the State Bank of India and the Housing Development Finance Corporation Ltd 
on behalf of FIIs/NRIs/OCBs. These shares can now be purchased with the prior 
approval of the Reserve Bank of India, through stock exchanges. The restrictions were 
placed in October 1996 and July 1997 respectively when the overall ceiling of 20 per 
cent (State Bank of India) and 30 per cent (Housing Development Finance Corporation 
Ltd.) was reached. The holding of FIIs/NRIs/OCBs in these institutions has now come 
down below 20 per cent and 30 per cent respectively due to sale of their shares.
