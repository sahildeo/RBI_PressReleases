Indian Companies seeking NRI/OCB Investments - RBI simplifies procedure
       In order to further simplify the procedure for investments from non-resident Indians/Overseas Corporate Bodies
(NRI/OCB) in Indian companies the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has decided to grant general permission under the
Foreign Exchange Regulation Act (FERA) 1973, in respect of 24%/40% Scheme. It will no longer be necessary for
the Indian companies to approach the Reserve Bank of India for permission to receive remittances from NRIs/OCBs
and issue shares thereagainst. Necessary Notification No.F.E.R.A.187/98-RB dated October 3, 1998 under FERA to
give effect to the revised simplified procedure has been issued.
       Henceforth, Indian companies will not require RBI permission for the purpose of receiving inward remittances
and issue shares to the NRI/OCB investors under the 24%/40% Scheme. These companies will, however, have to
file the required documents with the concerned Regional Office of the Reserve Bank within 30 days after the issue
of shares to NRIs/OCBs.
       Applications pending with the Reserve Bank of India requiring examination will be dealt with expeditiously as
per the procedure prevailing before the date of the Notification.
