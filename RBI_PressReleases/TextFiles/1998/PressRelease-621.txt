Finances of State Governments 1997-98 
Reserve Bank of India has published an article, "Finances of the State Governments: 
1997-98" as a supplement to its February 1998 Bulletin.  
The State Government budgets for 1997-98 show that concerted efforts towards fiscal 
consolidation have been planned. The measures of the States would help reverse the 
rising trend in revenue deficit in 1997-98. The aggregate revenue deficit of the State 
Governments put together for 1997-98 is placed at Rs. 15,373 crore or 1.1 per cent of 
gross domestic product (GDP) which is marginally lower than the revenue deficit of Rs. 
15,855 crore (1.3 per cent of GDP) in 1996-97. The consolidated fiscal deficit of States 
would amount to Rs.45,530 crore or 3.1 per cent of GDP in 1997-98 as compared with 
that of Rs. 41,845 crore (3.3 per cent of GDP) in 1996-97. The estimated fiscal deficit in 
1996-97 would be financed to the extent of 47.6 per cent through loans from Centre and 
the remaining 52.4 per cent through States' capital receipts. The expenditure of State 
Governments in 1997-98 is budgeted to show a sharp acceleration mainly on account of 
implementation of the recommendations of the Fifth Pay Commission award and other 
committed expenditures like interest payments. The expenditure on administrative 
services and general services is estimated to rise by 44.3 per cent and 66.4 per cent, 
respectively, while expenditure on direct developmental activities would rise by only 4.6 
per cent. The expenditure on energy and industry is budgeted to decline. The growth 
rate of outlay on social services would also decline to almost one half of the 1996-97 
level. Growth in revenue expenditure during 1997-98 at Rs. 1,91,551 crore is estimated 
to decelerate to 10.7 per cent compared with 19.4 per cent in 1996-97. The non-
developmental expenditure under revenue account would record a steep rise of 24.5 per 
cent mainly on account of pension, interest payments and administrative services. The 
interest payments would go up by 17.0 per cent from Rs. 26,563 crore in 1996-97 to Rs. 
31,089 crore in 1997-98. The ratio of interest payments to revenue receipts would go up 
from 16.9 per cent in 1996-97 to 17.6 per cent in 1997-98. The developmental 
expenditure is estimated to rise by 2.3 per cent. The current expenditure on power 
sector and industry and minerals is budgeted lower than last year.  
The consolidated revenue receipts of State Governments are budgeted to rise by 12.1 
per cent in 1997-98 compared to 14.9 per cent in 1996-97. The growth in States' own 
taxes is projected at 17.0 per cent in 1997-98 compared with 13.3 per cent in 1996-97. 
States' taxes are estimated to finance 44.2 per cent of the revenue expenditure in 1997-
98 as compared to 41.8 per cent in 1996-97. Despite the projected higher growth of 
States' taxes, its percentage to GDP would remain stagnant. The ratio of States' non-tax revenue to GDP would decline to 3.5 per cent in 1997-98 from 4.0 per cent in 1996-97 
and 4.3 per cent in the second half of the `eighties.  
The approved Plan outlay of the States in 1997-98 has been placed at Rs.62,732 crore, 
excluding Sikkim, of which, 44.5 per cent is estimated to be financed by Central 
assistance and 11.4 per cent through market borrowings. Many States have negative 
balance from current revenue (BCR), which affect the size of States' Plans. The negative 
contribution from public sector undertakings like State Electricity Board, Road Transport 
Corporations have also affected the States' Plan size.  
The stress on the finances of State Governments has been evident since the `eighties. 
The steady deterioration in the revenue account caused enlargement in the gross fiscal 
deficit of the States. The gross fiscal deficit of the States has been stagnant around 3.0 
per cent of GDP since the mid-eighties. The financing of the gross fiscal deficit through 
borrowings has created an enormous debt-servicing burden.  
The public sector undertakings of the States, particularly State Electricity Boards and 
State Road Transport Corporations, have persistently recorded losses and therefore 
their contribution to the State exchequer is negative. Several irrigation projects have also 
contributed negatively to the State budgets. The rising losses recorded by the State 
public sector undertakings have put pressure on the optimal allocation of resources, 
through the budget, as a large proportion of resources is diverted towards current 
expenditure leading to a decline in capital expenditure - GDP ratio.  
A sustained improvement in State finances could be achieved only through reduction in 
the borrowing requirements of the States. The improvement in gross fiscal deficit should 
be achieved through the revenue account. To contain the revenue gap from widening 
further it would be necessary to enlarge the tax base which would augment resources to 
absorb the rising expenditure. This would require, therefore, fresh tax and non-tax 
measures, and also the need to rationalise and reform the existing tax structure for 
better compliance. States should give high priority for the development of human capital 
through expansion of social and economic infrastructure like education, basic health, 
drinking water, etc. In this context, States need to encourage private sector participation 
in the development of social and economic infrastructure which would reduce stress on 
States' resources. The additional resources which would be made available to States out 
of Voluntary Disclosure of Income Scheme (VDIS) in 1998-99 should be utilised for the 
development of infrastructure facilities. Further, States need to focus on the issue of 
subsidies, user charges, pricing policies and better management of public sector 
undertakings.
