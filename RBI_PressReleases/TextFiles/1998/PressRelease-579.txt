Management Information System (MIS)  for Monitoring Agricultural Advances  
: Bank of Baroda Model : 
Bank of Baroda has evolved a model system for monitoring agricultural and other advances and it is being 
implemented on pilot basis in its Moradabad Region (Western UP Zone).  
This MIS system has been computerized to generate pre-printed updation sheets containing basic information 
about the existing borrowal accounts and blank formats for recording new disbursals during the intervening 
period. Some of the branches are also sent data on magnetic media for its updation locally. The updation 
centres receive updated data on hard copy in 2-3 days' time. Decentralization of data updation is reported to 
have improved branch participation and quality of data significantly.  
The data is processed on computers at regional level and the branches receive statutory reports/returns for 
their use along with other informative reports for improving the quality of credit administration. Such Single 
Point Periodic Updation reduces workload at branches and controlling office significantly. The time saved thus 
is directed for improving quality of loan assets, canvassing deposit accounts and improving customer service 
in the area.  
Indicated below is a statement showing reports & returns which were required to be submitted earlier and the 
status after implementation of the revised system.

By implementing the above, the branches will not be required to submit 12 out of 24 returns saving about 190 
man days per year per branch of average size. At a later stage, after the system is stabilised and updation is 
done on quarterly basis, the branches may not need to send returns at Sr.Nos.14, 20 and 21 above also as 
the same can then be generated with the help of the updated data.  
The data should be used by controlling offices to send information that may be required by Reserve Bank of 
India or any other agency in relation to specific activities as the computerised system will be able to generate 
such information.
