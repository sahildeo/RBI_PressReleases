Merchant banking companies exempted from Reserve Bank of India 
regulations 
   The Reserve Bank of India has today exempted merchant banking companies from the 
provisions of Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 relating to compulsory registration 
(section 45IA), maintenance of liquid assets (sections 45IB), creation of reserve fund 
(section 45IC) and all the provisions of the recent Directions relating to deposit 
acceptance and prudential norms.  
Merchant banking companies, to be eligible for the above exemption, are required to 
satisfy the following conditions:  
i. such companies are registered with SEBI under section 12 of the SEBI Act, 1992 
and are carrying on the business of merchant banker in accordance with 
Rules/Regulations framed by SEBI;  
ii. they acquire securities only as part of their merchant banking business;  
iii. they do not carry on any other financial activities as mentioned in section 45I(c) 
of the RBI Act, 1934;  
iv. they do not accept/hold public deposits.  
Background  
 
SEBI had, recently through an amendment to Merchant Banking (Rules and 
Regulations) 1992 had made companies ineligible for registration as merchant banker if 
they are carrying on any of the financial activities mentioned in the RBI Act. As it is quite 
likely that as part of treasury management these merchant banking companies may 
deploy a portion of their networth in securities and they may also perform the activities of 
underwriting which demands acquisition of securities and the said activities constitute 
financial activities, SEBI has suggested to RBI certain exemptions for these merchant 
banking companies from the provisions of RBI Act and NBFC Directions. RBI, has 
accordingly decided to exempt fully dedicated merchant banking companies from its 
regulatory purview subject however to the conditions mentioned above. It may be 
recalled that RBI had earlier exempted stock broking and stock exchange companies 
from certain core provisions of the RBI Act as these entities are registered with and 
regulated by SEBI.
