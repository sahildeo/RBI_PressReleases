RBI Directives to Auditors of NBFCs 
 
The Reserve Bank of India has today issued directions to the statutory auditors of Non-
Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) requiring them to issue, in addition to the normal 
auditors' report on the financial statements to the shareholders, a report to the Board of 
Directors of the NBFC containing a statement on certain matters of supervisory concern 
to the RBI. These directions are intended to provide supervision over NBFCs and ensure 
that they comply with RBI directions. In the event, any of the statements by the auditors 
are unfavourable or qualified or in the opinion of the auditor, the NBFC has not complied 
with RBI directions, the auditors are obliged to directly bring these matters to the 
attention of RBI.  
The RBI has also written to the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) 
stressing the importance RBI attaches to the auditors' compliance with the directions 
issued today. RBI has drawn ICAI's attention to the penal provisions under the RBI Act 
which will become applicable to erring auditors. RBI has also informed ICAI that erring 
auditors will not be considered for appointment/approval as auditors of commercial 
banks and their cases shall be referred to the ICAI for initiating disciplinary action.  
Matters on which auditors shall report  
For the purposes of the directions, NBFCs have been categorised as (a) NBFCs which 
accept/hold public deposits, (b) NBFCs which do not accept/hold public deposits and (c) 
NBFCs which do not accept/hold public deposits and also invest not less 90 percent of 
their assets in securities of group/holding/subsidiary companies.  
In their report to the Board of Directors, the auditors will be required to make a statement 
confirming compliance by the NBFC with the directions issued by the RBI regarding (i) 
acceptance of public deposits, (ii) credit rating, (iii) prudential norms regarding income 
recognition, accounting standards, asset classification, provisioning, exposure limits etc, 
(iv) capital adequacy, (v) liquidity requirement and (vi) periodic submission of returns to 
RBI as applicable to the different categories of NBFCs.
