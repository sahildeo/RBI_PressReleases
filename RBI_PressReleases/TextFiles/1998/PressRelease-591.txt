Banks to value 10-Year paper at 12.15 per cent : RBI 
The Reserve Bank of India has indicated a Yield To Matu rity (YTM) of 12.15 per cent for 
securities of 10 years and beyond for the purpose of valuation of banks' portfolio of 
government and other securities while finalising the balance sheet as on March 31, 
1998; similarly, the valuation of securities for maturity of less than one year has been 
indicated at 9.43 per cent.  
As per the current RBI guidelines, banks are required to value the government securities 
in the 'current' category as per market quotations as on the last day of March wherever 
available; and use the yields indicated by the Reserve Bank for valuation of government 
securities where market quotations are not available. Banks are required to bifurcate 
their portfolio in approved securities into 'permanent' and 'current' categories in the ratio 
of 40:60 for the year ended March 31, 1998. For the year ending March 31, 1999, the 
ratio of `permanent' and `current' categories would be 30:70.  
The Reserve Bank has, in a circular issued on April 11 to all commercial banks 
excluding regional rural banks (RRBs), indicated the maturity-wise details for valuation of 
banks' investment portfolio for drawing up balance sheet as on March 31, 1998 as 
under:

The valuation of 6 per cent Capital Indexed Bonds should be done at 'cost'.  
The Reserve Bank has also reiterated that if there is any appreciation in the value of 
securities on account of this valuation, banks should not book it as income. Further, 
banks which have adopted a more prudent method of valuation of securities than the 
present one may continue the practice followed by them. Any gain on sale of securities 
in the 'permanent' category should, however, be first taken to the profit and loss account 
and thereafter appropriated to "Capital Reserve".  
Detailing the valuation method for 'permanent' invest ments, the Reserve Bank has 
stated that they should be valued at cost and in case the cost price is higher than the 
face value, the premium should be amortised over the remaining period of maturity of 
the security. On the other hand, where the cost price is less than the face value, the 
difference should be ignored and should not be amortised or taken to income account 
since the amount represents unrealised gain.  
As per the Reserve Bank directive, banks are required to value securities under each 
category scrip-wise and aggregate depreciation/appreciation category-wise. Banks are 
required to provide for net depreciation but ignore net appreciation, if any. Net 
depreciation in any one category is not allowed to be netted off against net appreciation 
in any other category. The Reserve Bank has also clarified that the reckoning of number 
of years for the purpose of deciding upon appropriate YTM rate should be done by 
rounding off the fractional period of a year to the nearest completed year.  
Describing the valuation method for different types of investments, the Reserve Bank 
circular states that while the taxable PSUs bonds should be valued at one per cent 
above the YTM rates of government securities of similar maturities, tax-free bonds of 
PSUs should be valued at 10 per cent. For valuation of other unquoted securities, banks 
have been asked to uniformly follow the YTM method.  
The Reserve Bank has asked banks to value shares, debentures and mutual fund units 
on their portfolio on the basis of stock exchange quotations wherever available.  
In the case of shares, where current quotations are not available or where shares are 
not quoted on stock exchanges, valuation should be done at book value which is to be 
ascertained from the latest balance sheet. Banks have, however, been asked not to 
consider revaluation reserves, if any, while arriving at the book value of such shares. In 
case the latest balance sheet is not available, the shares should be taken at Re.1 per 
company. Shares of public sector companies should be valued at the break-up value as 
per the balance sheet as on March 31, 1997. In case March 31, 1997 balance sheet is 
not available the break-up value as per March 31, 1996 balance sheet should be worked 
out and reduced or discounted by 20 per cent. In case even March 31, 1996 balance 
sheet is not available, the shares of concerned PSUs should be valued at Re.1 per 
company.  
Debentures for which current quotations are not available or debentures which are not 
quoted at stock exchanges, should be valued at carrying cost (i.e. book value) if interest 
is regular ly serviced and if interest is in arrears, depreciation should be booked on the 
same lines as advances which are classified as sub-standard, doubtful and loss.  Investments in mutual fund units which are not quoted on stock exchanges should be 
valued on the basis of the latest net asset value declared by the mutual funds in respect 
of each particular scheme. Investments in subsidiaries and sponsored institutions should 
be valued at carrying cost (i.e. book value). In the case of recapitalisation bonds 
received by natio nalised banks from the government, banks are not required to provide 
for depreciation except when they are acquired from other banks for investment 
purposes; in that case depreciation, if any, will have to be provided for. Recapitalisation 
bonds do not form part of 'permanent' or 'current' investments.
