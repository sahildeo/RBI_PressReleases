Bank credit to NBFCs for transport operators to be treated as priority sector 
lending 
Under the existing guidelines, advances to small road and water transport operators 
(SRWTOs) owning a fleet of vehicles not exceeding ten, are eligible to be classified-
under priority sector lending of commercial banks. The Reserve Bank of India has now 
decided that bank credit to eligible non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) for 
financing of trucks for the purpose of on-lending to SRWTOs will be treated as priority 
sector lending. The ultimate borrowers, that is, SRWTOs, should, however, satisfy the 
eligibility requirements for being classified under priority sector.
