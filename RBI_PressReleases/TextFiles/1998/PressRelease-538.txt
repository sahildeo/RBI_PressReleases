July 18, 1998 
RBI decentralises grant of automatic approval 
On June 11, 1998, the Reserve Bank of India had announced its intention to introduce a 
temporary new scheme of concessional interest rate on "incremental" exports. Under the 
scheme, the interest rate to be charged by banks on "incremental" exports (over the 
base year level of exports in 1997-98) was proposed to be fixed at 6.5 per cent for pre-
shipment and post-shipment credit. This scheme was in addition to the scheme of 
providing credit in foreign currency at LIBOR related for the entire volume of exports.  
The draft operational details of the new scheme were formulated by the Reserve Bank 
and circulated for comments/suggetions from bankers and exporting community on July 
2, 1998. Subsequently, the Reserve Bank convened meetings of exporters as well as 
bankers in order to discuss the scheme and refine the operational details. This was 
followed by further informal consultations with the exporting community. While on section 
of the exporters welcomed the proposed scheme, the others pointed out that the 
scheme, as it is conceived now, will not help much, particularly those exporters who for 
various reasons are not able to increase their exports over 1997-98 level. It was also 
pointed out that calculation of "incremental" exports may be operationally difficult, even 
though in the draft scheme care had been taken to value exports only in rupee terms.  
After taking into account various views expressed by exporters, on balance of 
considerations, the Reserve Bank of India has decided to drop the scheme of 
concessional credit for "incremental" exports. This scheme will no longer be 
implemented. Banks are being advised accordingly.  
The Reserve Bank of India would like to express its appreciation for the feedback given 
by exporters and bankers. It will be happy to receive suggestions for further improving 
the flow of credit for exports by removing any procedural and other bottlenecks, 
particularly in respect of the existing scheme for foreign currency loans to exporters at 
LIBOR related rates.
