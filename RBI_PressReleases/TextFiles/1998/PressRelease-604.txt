RBI to introduce Electronic Clearing Service (Credit Clearing) in more centres 
The Reserve Bank of India has decided to extend the Electronic Clearing Service (ECS - 
Credit Clearing Scheme) to eight more centres, viz., Bhubaneshwar, Chandigarh, 
Guwahati, Jaipur, Kanpur, Nagpur, Patna and Thiruvananthapuram with effect from July 
1, 1998. It has also been decided to increase the limit on the transaction value under the 
ECS (Credit) Scheme from the present Rs. 50,000 to Rs. 1,00,000 from that date. With 
this, the Scheme would cover all the centres where the Reserve Bank of India manages 
the Clearing Houses. The Scheme, which was first operationalised at the four 
metropolitan cities, was extended to four more centres, viz., Ahmedabad, Bangalore, 
Hyderabad and Pune, from July 1, 1997.  
The Reserve Bank has advised banks to bring these developments to the notice of their 
corporate customers issuing a large number of dividend payments, etc., and impress 
upon them to avail of the benefit under the ECS (Credit Clearing) facility.  
ECS (Credit) facilitates paperless transactions by enabling banks extending credit 
facilities to companies or acting as paying banks for Dividend warrants issued by 
companies to directly credit the customers' accounts with the Dividend amounts. The 
service not only facilitates faster credit but also helps avoid frauds.
