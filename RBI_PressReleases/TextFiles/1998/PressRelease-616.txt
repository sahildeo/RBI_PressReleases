FII/NRI holdings in Bank of Baroda go below 16 per cent 
The Reserve Bank of India has allowed purchase of shares of Bank of Baroda from the 
secondary market on behalf of foreign institutional investors (FIIs)/non-resident Indians 
(NRIs)/overseas corporate bodies (OCBs). The Reserve Bank stated that consequent 
upon the increase in the paid-up capital and sales of shares, the holdings of 
FIIs/NRIs/OCBs in Bank of Baroda have gone down below 16 per cent of its paid-up 
capital and therefore the requirement of obtaining the Reserve Bank's prior approval for 
further purchases of Bank of Baroda's shares has been withdrawn.
