Kapur Committee on SSI recommends special treatment to smaller among small 
It may recalled that Dr. Bimal Jalan, Governor, Reserve bank of India had, in December last year set up a one-man 
committee under Shri S.L. Kapur to review the working of credit delivery system for SSIs with a view to making the 
system much more effective, simple and efficient to administer.  
Special treatment to smaller among small industries, enhancement in the quantum of composite loans, removal of 
procedural difficulties in the path of SSI advances, sorting out issues relating to mortgages of land, including removal of 
stamp duty and permitting equitable mortgages, allowing access to low-cost funds to Small Industries Development 
Bank of India (SIDBI) for refinancing SSI loans, non-obtention of collaterals for loans upto Rs.2 lakhs, setting up of a 
collateral reserve fund to provide support to first generation of entrepreneurs who find it difficult to furnish collateral 
securities or third party guarantees, setting up of a Small Industries Infrastructure Development Fund for developing 
industrial areas in/around metropolitan and urban areas, change in the definition of sick SSI units, giving statutory 
powers to state level inter-institutional committee (SLIIC), setting up of a separate guarantee organisation and opening 
of 1000 additional specialised branches are among significant recommendations made by Shri S.L. Kapur, former 
Secretary, Ministry of Industries, Government of India.  
The Committee has also recommended enhancing of SIDBI's role and status to match with that of National Bank for 
Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), suggestions towards technological upgradation of various sub-sectors 
of SSI, granting 20 per cent additional ad hoc limits to SSIs from banks and setting up of a reconstruction fund with 
initiative and initial corpus from the Government of India and the Reserve Bank of India to enable branch managers to 
provide, if necessary, initial corpus margin money for such additional facilities, earmarking at least 40 per cent of 
resources of SIDBI to tiny sector, close cooperation between SFCs and public sector banks for jointly providing term 
loans and working capital limit to SSIs, NABARD to set up a fund similar to National Equity Fund to make facilities 
available to rural industrial units with projects costs up to Rs. 10 lakhs, appointment of separate ombudman in each 
bank for grievances not covered by RBI's banking ombudsman scheme, training and motivation for staff of regional 
rural banks (RRBs), urban cooperative banks (UCBs) and state finance corporations (SFCs).
