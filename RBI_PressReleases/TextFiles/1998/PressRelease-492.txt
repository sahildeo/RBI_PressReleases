RBI Guidelines on Hedging Commodity Price Risk
 
It may be recalled that the Reserve Bank had issued constituted a committee on Hedging through
International Commodity Exchanges under the Chairmanship of its then Deputy Governor Shri
R.V.Gupta. The recommendations of the committee were examined in consultation with the
Government of India and it has been decided to allow Indian corporates having genuine
underlying exposure to access international commodity exchanges for hedging of their
commodity price risk.
The Reserve Bank of India has today issued detailed operational guidelines for hedging of
commodity price risk by corporates. The handling of applications of corporates by authorised
dealers as also the risk management, internal control, reporting and monitoring system to be put
in place by the corporates for derivatives activity, etc., are covered in the guidelines.
As per the norms set out, access to recognised international commodity exchanges would be
through brokerage firms which are clearing members of exchanges. This facility would not be
allowed for oil and petroleum products. All exchange traded futures/options (purchases)
contracts would be allowed. The focus would be on risk containment. Only offset hedge would
be permitted. The tenure of the exposure would be limited to six months; tenure beyond six
months would require the Reserve Bank's approval. The Reserve Bank circular containing
detailed guidelines is also available on the RBI website (at http://www.rbi.org.in).
