Draft operational details of the scheme for concessional financing of "incremental exports" announced by the 
Reserve Bank of India  on June 11,1998 
Draft operational details of the scheme for concessional financing of "incremental exports" announced by the Reserve 
Bank of India on June 11,1998 The Reserve Bank of India had on June 11, 1998, announced as a special case and for 
a temporary period, a new scheme of concessional interest rate on "incremental exports". Under this scheme, the 
rupee interest rate to be charged by banks on incremental exports (over the base year level of exports in 1997-98) is 
only 6.5 per cent for pre-shipment credit for a maximum period of six months and for post-shipment credit for a 
maximum period of 90 days (i.e., a maximum period of nine months). This scheme of concessional rupee interest rate 
on incremental exports was in addition to the scheme for providing credit in foreign currency at LIBOR-related rates for 
the entire volume of exports.  
The operational details of the new scheme are:  
(a) Fixation of value of exports in the base year 1997-98  
The value of exports in the base year 1997-98 will be determined by converting the US dollar value of shipments made 
during the year into rupees. For this purpose, an exchange rate of Rs.40 will be used. Exports for the purpose of this 
scheme will mean the total value of shipments, FOB.  
 
Each exporter will provide to his/her bank a chartered accountant's certificate regarding the total value of his/her 
exports, calculated on the above basis. The certificate will be based on actual shipment documents and other relevant 
material.  
 
(b) Calculation of incremental exports  
The scheme will come into effect on July 1, 1998 and, as announced earlier, it will cease to operate on December 31, 
1999. The 18-month period July 1998-December 1999 will be divided into two sub-periods of nine months. The first 
sub-period (to be called sub-period I) will cover the shipments made during July 1998-March 1999. Sub-period II will 
cover shipments made during April 1999 -December 1999.  
 
For each sub-period, the exporter will have the option to calculate his/her incremental exports on a quarterly basis or for 
the entire nine-month period taken together. The exporter will also have the option, if he/she so chooses, to break the 
sub-period into a quarter and a half-year. Depending on the pattern of exports, the exporter should indicate to the bank, 
in advance, the period over which incremental exports should be calculated. Once this choice has been made, it cannot 
be altered during the operation of the scheme.  
 
Incremental exports will be calculated as the difference in the rupee value of exports in the relevant quarter/half-
year/nine-month period of sub-periods I and II over the proportionate value of exports in the quarter/half-year/nine-
month period of the base year 1997-98. In the base year, as a simple rule, the value of exports in a quarter will be one-
fourth of the total exports in 1997-98 (calculated as per the above formula); for a half-year it will be half of the total 
exports; and for nine months it will be three-fourth of the exports during the year.  
 
(c) An example  
Assume that exports in the base year 1997-98, as calculated in the above manner, were Rs.100 crore by a particular 
exporter. Assuming that the exporter has chosen to avail of the incremental scheme on a quarter basis, his base year 
exports per quarter will be Rs.25 crore.   
 
Assume that the exporter increases his/her exports to Rs.30 crore, Rs. 35 crore and Rs. 40 crore in each of the 
quarters of sub-period I. Under the new scheme, the exporter will be entitled to concessional credit at 6.5 per cent for 
incremental exports of Rs.5 crore, Rs.10 crore and Rs. 15 crore in each of the quarters of sub-period I. Similarly, in 
sub-period II, if exports increase to Rs.45 crore, Rs. 50 crore and Rs. 55 crore, he/she will be entitled to a concessional 
credit at 6.5 per cent for incremental exports of Rs. 20 crore, Rs. 25 crore and Rs.30 crore in each quarter of sub-period 
II.  
 
(d) Period of validity of the scheme  
As announced earlier, the above scheme is a temporary facility and will cease to be in operation on December 31, 
1999. It will not be renewed thereafter.  
 
The Reserve Bank of India has stated that it would call a meeting of representative bodies of exporters to discuss the 
draft scheme in order to identify any operational problems that might arise in implementation of the scheme. A meeting 
of bankers is also proposed to be convened for the same purpose. The Reserve Bank expects to finalise and issue the 
scheme to banks by July 10, 1998 after discussions with representative bodies of exporters and bankers.
