No prior approval for banks to start credit card business : RBI 
The Reserve Bank of India has done away with the requirement of prior approval for banks to undertake credit card 
business. In a circular issued yesterday, the Reserve Bank advised banks that it has been decided to allow banks freedom 
to undertake credit card business either independently or in tie-up arrangements with other card issuing banks. Banks 
desirous of setting up a separate subsidiary for undertaking credit card business would, however, require the Reserve 
Bank's prior approval.  
Earlier, the Reserve Bank had advised banks that for entering into credit card business it would be preferable for them to 
have a suitable tie-up arrangement with one of the banks which had already introduced credit cards and that such 
proposals should be forwarded to the Reserve Bank for approval.  
The Reserve Bank has reiterated that banks should conduct credit card business on sound lines and with the approval of 
the bank's board.
