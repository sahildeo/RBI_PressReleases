Credit Cards : Additional Facility for NRIs
        As a convenience to non-resident Indians (NRIs), the Reserve Bank of India has removed all restrictions on
NRIs nominating their relatives or other resident Indians as additional credit card holders against their own foreign
currency accounts held overseas. Any NRI can now have an additional credit card issued for a resident of India,
payment for which can be made against his foreign currency account held abroad. General permission to this effect
is being issued by the Reserve Bank. No remittances from India will be permitted for settlement of claims against
the additional card.
