Khan Working Group submits Full Report 
 
The Khan Working Group on harmonising the Role of develop- ment financial institutions (DFIs) and banks 
submitted its full report to the Governor, Reserve Bank of India yesterday. The Working Group had already 
submitted the summary of its recommen- dations on April 24. The full report contains, besides the sum- mary 
of recommendations, a historical perspective of banks and DFIs in India, international experience and best 
practices in financial industry and regulatory oversight, role, structure and operations of banks and financial 
institutions in India.  
It may be recalled that a Working Group of Chairmen of some commercial banks and DFIs was set up by the 
Reserve Bank in December 1997 under the Chairmanship of Shri S.H. Khan, Chairman and Managing 
Director, Industrial Development Bank of India. The Working Group was to review the role, structure and 
operations of DFIs and commercial banks in emerging operating environment and to suggest measures for 
bringing about harmonisation in their operations.  
It may also be noted that Dr. Bimal Jalan, Governor, Reserve Bank of India, while announcing the Monetary 
and Credit Policy for the first half of 1998-99, had stated that in consultation with the Government of India, a 
"Discussion Paper" would be pre- pared in order to focus on the issues involved in moving towards the 
concept of "Universal Banking" and abolishing distinctions between banks and DFIs. The Discussion Paper 
would contain the Reserve Bank's draft proposals for bringing about greater clarity in the respective roles of 
banks and financial institutions and for greater harmonisation of facilities and obligations applica- ble to them. 
This paper would also take into account those recommendations of the Narasimham Committee which have a 
bearing on the issues considered by the Khan Working Group.
