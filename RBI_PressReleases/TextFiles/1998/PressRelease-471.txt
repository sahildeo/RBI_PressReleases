International Credit Cards
       At present, the facility of international credit card is available to residents visiting foreign countries and they can utilise such cards up to 
their entitlement of foreign exchange for foreign visits. The Reserve Bank of India has relaxed the conditions for holding of International 
credit cards by residents. All residents are now permitted to hold International credit cards which can be used by them not only to meet their 
travel expenditure in accordance with their entitlement but also other payments like subscribing for a foreign journal, etc., as may be 
permissible under the exchange control regulations. Residents are also free to use such cards for payments within India.
       Reimbursements to card issuing establishments will have to be through authorised dealers as usual who will satisfy themselves that the 
remittances are in accordance with the exchange control regulations and are covered by powers delegated to them.
