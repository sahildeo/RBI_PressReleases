Investment Limits by NRIs/PIOs/OCBs in Indian Companies through Secondary 
Markets enhanced, excluded from Portfolio Investments Limits for FIIs 
The Reserve Bank of India has modified NRIs/PIOs/OCBs investment ceilling for 
puchase of shares in a company through stock exchanges under the Portfolio 
Investment Scheme.  
Now, the investment limit by a single Non-resident Indian (NRI)/Person of Indian Origin 
(PIO)/Overseas Corporate Body owned by such persons to the extent of atleast 60 per 
cent (OCB) in a company has been enhanced from the existing level of 1 per cent to 5 
per cent of the paid up equity capital of the company. Similarly, the aggregate limit for all 
NRIs/PIOs/OCBs investment through the secondary market in a company has been 
raised from the existing level of 5 per cent to 10 per cent of the paid up equity capital. 
The individual and aggregate ceilling limits for portfolio investments by NRIs/OCBs/PIOs 
would be exclusive of the aggregate portfolio investment ceiling for Foreign Institutional 
Investors (FIIs).  
To facilitate speedy approval, the Reserve Bank has also delegated to the designated 
banks, powers for renewal of general permission already granted by the Reserve Bank 
of India to individual NRIs for purchase of shares through stock exchanges. Such RBI 
permission granted through designated banks to NRIs/PIOs/OCBs for secondary market 
transactions is valid for five years.  
The Reserve Bank has stated that the earlier facility of aggregate investment by all 
NRIs/PIOs/OCBs through stock exchanges upto the enhanced limit of 24 per cent 
subject to the general body resolution of a company would continue to be operative. FII 
investments would also continue to be subject to a separate aggregate ceilling of 24 per 
cent/30 per cent of the paid up equity capital of a company.  
The Reserve Bank modifications are in pursuance of the announcement made by the 
Finance Minister in his budget speech for 1998-99.
