Report on Currency and Finance - 1996-97 
The economic fundamentals continue to be strong, with growth imeing nurtured by a 
positive policy framework. Price stability has been the main gain of the economic 
situation so far : this should help improve India's competitiveness, reduce economic 
hardships on the poor and promote growth. This was the conclusion drawn in the Report 
on Currency and Finance - 1996-97. Prepared by the professional staff of the 
Department of Economic Analysis and Policy of the Reserve Bank of India, the Report 
has now been published. The Report is a reference document containing comprehensive 
coverage of the economic and financial developments during the fiscal year 1996-97. 
The Report is published in two Volumes. Volume I of the Report presents an economic 
review while volume II contains statistical statements. Volume I contains, in all, 11 
chapters. Chapter I reviews in brief the developments during the fiscal year 1996-97 and 
covers in a nutshell the emerging economic scenario during the fiscal year 1997-98 so 
far. Chapters II, III and IV deal with real sector developments relating to national income, 
agricultural production and industrial performance. Chapter V covers monetary and 
banking developments. Chapter VI deals with developments in the financial markets 
while chapter VII gives an account of policy developments and price trends in commodity 
and bullion market. In chapter VIII fiscal developments are reviewed. The developments 
in foreign trade, balance of payments and international finance are covered in chapters 
IX and X. Chapter XI provides a synoptic view of major developments in the States and 
Union Territories. The coverage of data in various chapters in the Report is determined 
by the availability of firm data on related economic variables.  
Developments during 1997-98 
Agriculture  
 
For the tenth year in succession, the country received normal rainfall during the South-
West monsoon season 1997 (June-September). The onset of the South-West monsoon 
was however, delayed in certain parts of the crop growing areas, resulting in decline in 
the total area under cultivation and consequent drop in Kharif output, especially in 
respect of coarse cereals. The overall production of Kharif foodgrains is likely to be 
around 103.5 million tonnes - lower than the Kharif output of 1996-97, and two million 
tonnes short of the target for 1997-98. Nonetheless, the favourable performance of the 
South-West monsoon during the latter part of the season and the resultant comfortable 
reservoirs' position assuring adequate availability of irrigation water are expected to 
benefit the Rabi crops.  
 Output of sugarcane, cotton, jute and mesta, and oilseeds wouler, register declines 
compared to the levels recorded in 1996-97. On the whole, the growth of overall 
agricultural output during 1997-98 over the preceding year may thus, at best be 
marginal.  
 
Industry  
 
According to the latest data on industrial production (IIP), the industrial sector registered 
a lower growth of 4.7 per cent during the period April-August 1997 as compared with 
11.2 per cent in the corresponding period of the preceding year. 'Manufacturing sector', 
having a weight of 77.1 per cent in the IIP, showed a decelerated growth of 4.2 per cent 
in April-August 1997 which was less than one-third of that recorded in the corresponding 
period of the preceding year (l4.3 per cent). On the other hand, 'mining and quarrying' 
and 'electricity generation' sectors recorded substantially higher growth rates of 6.1 per 
cent and 6.7 per cent, respectively, during April-August 1997 as compared with 0.9 per 
cent and 2.6 per cent, respectively, in the corresponding period of the previous year. 
Industrial production in the current year so far has thus, exhibited mixed trends.  
 
Capital Market  
 
During the first six months of the financial year 1997-98, the primary segment of the 
capital market was virtually dormant. New capital issues by the non-Government 
companies, Government companies and banks and financial institutions (in the public 
sector) taken together aggregated Rs.1,737 crore (provisional) during April-September 
1997, which were 83.0 per cent lower than that during the corresponding period of 1996. 
Among them, the issues by the non-Government public limited companies (i.e., private 
corporate sector) at Rs.1,695 crore were lower by 76.5 per cent than that during the 
corresponding period of 1996. The amount raised by the corporates from abroad through 
Euro-issues at Rs.2,228 crore was also lower than Rs.2,348 crore raised in the 
corresponding period of the previous year. There was no new issue by banks and 
financial institutions during the current financial year so far as against Rs.1,200 crore 
raised by them during the comparable period of last year. Only one Government 
company accessed the market, and that too for only Rs.43 crore -sharply lower than 
Rs.1,842 crore raised by the Government companies during the corresponding period of 
previous year.  
 
The secondary segment of the capital market generally displayed a mixed trend. The 
monthly average of RBI Index of Ordinary Share Prices (Base: 1980-81=100), which 
stood at 1069.7 in March 1997, moved up to 1189.8 in August 1997, but declined 
moderately to 1115.5 in September 1997. According to provisional data, the index 
declined further to 1096.6 in October 1997. The Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) 
Sensitive Index reflected, more or less, the same trends. While the positive mood in the 
stock market was influenced by the proposals in the Union Budget 1997-98, declining 
interest rates, normal monsoon, and higher net investments by the foreign institutional 
investors, the dull sentiment in the market has been attributed to lower industrial growth 
and political factors. Domestic mutual funds have mobilised Rs. 3,493 crore during April-
September 1997 in contrast to a negative mobilisation (due to higher repurchases) of 
Rs. 991 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year.  
 
The data pertaining to sanctions and disbursements made by the all-India financial 
institutions during the period April-September 1997 showed a divergent trend; sanctions 
at Rs.32,237 crore registered a substantial rise of 40.9 per cent, while disbursements at 
Rs.18,968 crore recorded a marginal decline of 3.5 per cent over the comparable period 
of last fiscal year.   
Fiscal Developments  
 
A highpoint of the fiscal developments during 1997-98 has been the elimination of the 
practice of automatic monetisation of the budget deficit with effect from April l, l997. 
Following the signing of an Agreement on March 26, 1997 between the Government of 
India and Reserve Bank, the system of ad hocs has been replaced by a new scheme of 
Ways and Means Advances (WMA). For the fiscal year 1997-98, the limit for WMA for 
the first six months (April-October) was fixed at Rs.12,000 crore and for the subsequent 
six months (November-March) at Rs. 8,000 crore.  
 
During the current financial year, the financial position of the Central Government has 
been marked by a significant deceleration in revenue growth concomitant with a sharp 
rise in expenditure commitments. During April-September 1997, revenue receipts rose 
by only 5.3 per cent as against the Budget estimate of 17.1 per cent. Tax revenue i.e., 
both direct and indirect taxes, showed marked decline in absolute terms; tax revenue 
declined by 1.5 per cent as against 16.6 per cent growth envisaged in the Budget. On 
the other hand, aggregate expenditure growth accelerated to 15.3 per cent as compared 
with 12.4 per cent during the same period of the preceding year. Consequently, the 
revenue deficit during April-September 1997 at Rs.13,880 crore was around 75 per cent 
higher than the amount for the corresponding period of the last year (Rs. 7,948 crore). 
Government had initially targeted mobilisation of Rs. 4,800 crore of revenue through 
disinvestment programme in the Budget which was subsequently revised to Rs. 7,000 
crore. The slippage in revenue deficit together with non-realisation of disinvestment 
proceeds inevitably resulted in widening of the fiscal deficit, which during April - 
September 1997 at Rs. 38,937 crore constituted 60 per cent of the targeted fiscal deficit 
for 1997-98 (i.e., Rs. 65,454 crore).  
 
Notwithstanding the fiscal pressure, favourable market conditions and improved liquidity 
position contributed to raising the required amount of resources for the Central 
Government without placing much reliance on the Reserve Bank support. This is 
reflected in the fact that the Central Government hardly relied on Ways and Means 
Advances (WMA) from RBI in the greater part of the fiscal year, so far. This was 
rendered possible by the Centre building up large cash surpluses, in anticipation of large 
expenditures such as, for example, pay hikes following the acceptance of the 
recommendations of the Fifth Pay Commission. The large cash surpluses so built were 
invested in marketable Government securities held in the RBI's own investment portfolio.  
Given the difficult revenue situation, some of the post Budget developments on the 
expenditure front, such as, announcement of the scheme to finance the Oil Pool account 
deficit and the decision to give effect to the recommendations of the Fifth Pay 
Commission are expected to place further pressure on the finances of the Central 
Government. Despite the Government's measures (both tax and non-tax) to mobilise 
additional resources, the net impact of these developments on the fiscal deficit is 
expected to be adverse in 1997-98.  
 
For the fiscal year 1997-98, comfortable liquidity conditions in money and credit markets 
facilitated successful placement of the Government's borrowing programme in the 
market. In fact, the bulk of the borrowing programme was completed during the first half 
of the financial year. Around 78 per cent of the borrowings raised through dated 
securities were placed for medium-term maturities (i.e, 5 to 10 years). The market 
subscription of the RBI to primary issues of dated securities amounted to 19.1 per cent 
of the dated stocks issued, arising mainly on account of private placement of Rs. 5,000 
crore with the Bank. Moreover, special securities with the Reserve Bank amounting to Rs. 20,000 crore were converted into marketable securities of varying yield and maturity 
and were placed with the Bank.  
 
Reflecting the improved liquidity situation there was a sharp decline in interest rates 
across all maturities, leading to a further downward drift in the yield curve.  
 
The overall fiscal position of the State Governments for 1997-98 reveals a somewhat 
favourable outlook with some indications such as decline in their combined revenue 
deficit. The fiscal deficit, however, shows an increase of 8.8 per cent to Rs. 45,530 crore 
in 1997-98, due to the increase in developmental capital outlay and higher net lending.  
 
Monetary and Banking Trends  
 
During the current financial year so far (up to November 7, 1997), the expansion of 
broad money (M3) was higher at Rs. 69,076 crore (9.9 per cent) than that of Rs. 49,659 
crore (8.2 per cent) during the corresponding period of the previous year, emanating 
mainly from large accretions to net foreign exchange assets of the Reserve Bank.  
 
During the current financial year 1997-98 (up to November 7, 1997), aggregate deposits 
of scheduled commercial banks increased by Rs.45,860 crore (9.1 per cent) as 
compared with a rise of Rs.30,582 crore (7.0 per cent) in the corresponding period of the 
previous year. The increase was primarily attributable to time deposits which rose by 
Rs.47,455 crore (11.4 per cent) during the same period. Bank credit expanded by 
Rs.7,585 crore (2.7 per cent) as compared with an increase of Rs.3,498 crore (1.4 per 
cent) recorded during the same period of the previous year. Of the total bank credit, the 
food credit registered a substantial rise of Rs.3,145 crore (41.4 per cent) while the 
expansion in non-food credit was placed at Rs.4,440 crore (1.6 per cent). The total flow 
of funds from scheduled commercial banks to commercial sector comprising loans and 
advances and investments, showed a substantially larger increase of Rs.14,421 crore 
during the period under review than that of Rs. 6,173 crore during the corresponding 
period of 1996-97. Scheduled commercial banks' investments in Government securities 
also showed a sharp increase of Rs.30,939 crore (19.5 per cent) in 1997-98 (up to 
November 7, 1997) as compared with an increase of Rs.17,232 crore (13.0 per cent) 
during the corresponding period of 1996-97.  
 
Interest Rate Developments  
 
The decline in interest rates witnessed in 1996-97 continued during 1997-98, in 
response to the various policy initiatives undertaken. This process was reinforced by the 
operationalisation of the Bank Rate in April 1997 as an instrument to transmit signals of 
monetary policy and also as a reference rate for influencing interest rates in the 
economy. The sharp reductions in the CRR during 1996-97 and the large deposit growth 
led to a comfortable liquidity position in the system which, coupled with a low rate of 
inflation, facilitated a significant reduction in interest rates across all maturities and 
instruments. The cut-off yields on auctions of 91-day and 364-day Treasury Bills were 
placed at 6.22 per cent and 7.98 per cent, respectively towards the third week of 
November 1997 compared with 7.96 per cent and 10.10 per cent at end-March 1997. 
Moreover, the cut-off yield on dated stock of 5 year maturity declined from 12.69 per 
cent in May 1997 to 11.15 per cent in September 1997. Many public sector banks 
progressively brought down their PLRs to 12.5 to 13.0 per cent by November 1997 from 
16.5 per cent in March 1996. The monetary and credit policy for the second half of 1997-
98 effected, inter alia, a further reduction in the interest rates.  
 Price Situation  
 
During 1997-98, there has been a sharp moderation in the inflation rate especially since 
July 1997. As measured by the variations in the Wholesale Price Index (WPI), the 
inflation rate was placed lower at 3.20 per cent, on a point-to-point basis, up to 
November 8, 1997 as compared with 6.50 per cent recorded during the comparable 
period of the previous year. The overall cumulative increase in the WPI (up to November 
l, l997) was shared by all the commodity groups i.e., the 'Manufactured Products' group 
(1.3 per cent), the 'Primary Articles' group (0.9 per cent) and the 'Fuel, Power, Light and 
Lubricants' group (0.8 per cent).  
 
The Consumer Price Index for Industrial Workers (CPI-IW) increased, on a point-to-point 
basis, by 2.8 per cent during March - September 1997 which was also much lower than 
the increase of 7.8 per cent recorded during the corresponding period of the previous 
year.  
 
External Sector  
 
According to the provisional data available from DGCI & S, India's exports at US $ 
19,885 million during the first seven months of the current financial year registered a 
moderate growth rate of 5.2 per cent as compared with 9.9 per cent during the 
corresponding period of the preceding year. The deceleration in exports was mainly due 
to decline in growth rate of exports of primary products. Besides, there was a major slow 
down in the world exports during 1996. During April-October 1997, imports at US $ 
22,562 million recorded a growth rate of 6.5 per cent - marginally up from the growth of 
6.4 per cent during the corresponding period of the previous year, attributable mainly to 
substantial rise in non-oil imports. Consequently, the trade deficit widened to US $ 2,677 
million during April-October 1997, from US $ 2,276 million in the corresponding period of 
the previous year. The export-import ratio, which is an indicator of the extent to which 
exports can finance imports, witnessed a marginal decline from 89.3 per cent during 
April-October 1996 to 88.1 per cent during April-October 1997. In terms of SDR, exports 
and imports registered growth rates of 11.0 per cent and 12.4 per cent, respectively, 
during the first seven months of 1997-98.  
 
Capital flows (net) are expected to be positive and significant during 1997-98. During the 
first seven months of 1997-98 (April-October) foreign direct investment flows were 
considerably higher at US $ 2,055 million as compared with US $ 1,277 million in the 
corresponding period of 1996-97, while portfolio investment flows at US $ 1,825 million 
were marginally lower than those in the corresponding period of the previous year. 
Inflows under non-resident deposits declined from US $ 2,141 million during 1996-97 
(April- October) to US $ 784 million during 1997-98 (April- October); the decline can be 
attributed to the outflow under the discontinued FCNR (A) scheme as also lower inflows 
under NR(NR)RD scheme.  
 
During the current fiscal year (up to November 28, 1997) India's foreign exchange 
reserves comprising foreign currency assets of the RBI, SDRs and gold moved up by US 
$ 1,696 million to a level of US $ 28,119 million mainly on account of purchases made by 
the RBI through large market interventions, notwithstanding the outflows by way of 
withdrawals under the FCNR(A) scheme. During the same period, foreign currency 
assets of the RBI increased by US $ 2,016 million. On the other hand, the value of the 
stock of gold held by the Reserve Bank declined from US $ 4,054 million at end- March 
1997 to US $ 3,735 million as on November 28, 1997, due almost entirely to valuation 
loss resulting from movements in gold prices.  
 The exchange rate of the rupee depreciated gradually from Rs. 35.8139 per US dollar in 
April 1997 to Rs. 38.9900 per US dollar as on December 4, 1997 reflective of a 
correction of the cumulative real appreciation of the rupee. The trade based real 
effective exchange rate of the rupee which had appreciated by 9.6 per cent by March 
1997 over March 1993, rose further by 3.1 per cent during April-August 1997. In the face 
of large capital inflows and subdued demand conditions creating surplus conditions in 
the foreign exchange market during April-August 1997, the conduct of the exchange rate 
policy was guided by the need to maintain a delicate balance between the 
considerations of external competitiveness and price stability. RBI's net intervention 
purchases during this period were substantial. During the month of September, however, 
the exchange rate depreciated by 1.5 per cent and the speed of depreciation was 
moderated by intervention sales by the RBI. The intervention sales dampened volatility 
and helped to restore orderly conditions in the market.  
Outlook 
The favourable monsoon this year stabilises the agriculture sector's output prospects 
and the foodgrains production is likely to improve marginally. The performance of the 
industrial sector, has been a cause for some concern. However, the improvement in the 
performance of infrastructure industries and possible increases in export demand augur 
well for bringing about increase in manufacturing production in the coming months. 
Interest rates, both short-term and long-term, have shown a noticeable decline. On the 
monetary and credit side, there has been a substantial expansion in deposits in the 
recent period. The banking system, as a result, has sufficient lendable resources, and 
the financial sector is in a position to step up the flow of resources to enable productive 
activities to improve their output performance. Since early October 1997, there has been 
a sharp increase in the overall flow of resources (in the form of both conventional credit 
and investments in shares / bonds / debentures / commercial paper of commercial units) 
to the commercial sector compared with the position in the corresponding period of the 
previous year.  
 
In the area of Government finances, developments on the expenditure front are 
expected to heighten pressures requiring the Government to make efforts to reverse the 
deceleration in revenue growth and prioritise the expenditures. Reduction of subsidies is 
of critical importance in this context. Although the growth of exports is lower than 
anticipated and causing concern, the current account deficit is expected to be around 1.5 
per cent of GDP and is well manageable. The net capital flows are expected to ensure a 
comfortable foreign exchange reserve position during 1997-98.
