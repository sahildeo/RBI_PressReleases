Release of exchange for studies abroad 
The Reserve Bank of India has advised authorised dealers that it will be in order for 
them to release the quota of foreign exchange to students going abroad for studies in 
one or more instalments as may be required by the students/guardian concerned. The 
Reserve Bank has also advised the authorised dealers that it will be in order for them to 
release exchange for a longer period, i.e., beyond six months, in cases where the 
overseas university/educational institution insists on payment of fees for full year/term, 
on production of a letter from the university/educational institution abroad to that effect. 
Further, the authorised dealers may release exchange to students going for studies to 
Russia and other republics of CIS countries for a period not exceeding one year in the 
form of foreign currency notes, if requested by the students concerened.  
Earlier, authorised dealers could release foreign exchange to students going abroad for 
studies initially to meet the requirement for six months.
