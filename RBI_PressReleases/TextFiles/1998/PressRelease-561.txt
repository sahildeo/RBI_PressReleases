Investment by Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) in Government dated Securities and Treasury Bills 
Following the policy decisions taken by RBI/SEBI and amendments to SEBI(FIIs) Regulations, 1995, the RBI guidelines 
issued on March 8, 1997 specifying the manner of transactions by Foreign Institutional Investors stand amended to enable 
all FIIs to invest in Government dated securities and Treasury Bills. These amendments enable equity funds to invest in the 
above within their debt ceiling of 30 per cent and the debt funds to the full extent.  
2. The amendments are to the following effect :  
a. For the purpose of FII investment, Government securities would include dated securities of both Government of India 
and State Governments of all maturities and Treasury Bills of Government of India.  
b. Investment in Government dated securities and Treasury Bills by FIIs may be made either in the primary market at 
the auction/floatation or in the secondary market.  
3. As regards procedures, the guidelines given in respect of investment by FII debt funds in Government securities would 
be alicable.  
4. It may be recalled that in pursuance of the monetary and credit policy for the first half of 1998-99 the Securities and 
Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has issued Notification No. S.O.417(E) dated May 18, 1998 amending the Securities and 
Exchange Board of India (Foreign Institutional Investors) Regulations, 1995 in terms of which Foreign Institutional Investors 
are now permitted to invest in Treasury Bills.  
5. It may also be recalled that in pursuance of the Monetary and Credit Policy for the second half of 1997-98, Securities and 
Exchange Board of India (SEBI) had issued Notification No.S.O.333(E) dated April 20, 1998 amending the Securities and 
Exchange Board of India (Foreign Institutional Investors) Regulations, 1995 in terms of which Foreign Institutional Investors
