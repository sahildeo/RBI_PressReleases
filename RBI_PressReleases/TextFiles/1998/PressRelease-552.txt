RBI issues guidelines for issue of commercial paper by satellite dealers 
With a view to enabling the satellite dealers to have access to short-term borrowings the Reserve Bank has decided to 
permit them to issue commercial paper (CP). The system of satellite dealers was introduced by the Reserve Bank to 
strengthen the securities market infrastructure ans bring about an improvement in the secondary market trading system 
with particular reference to government securities.  
In a notification issued on June 17, 1998, the Reserve Bank has set out the guidelines for issues of CP by satellite 
dealers. The salient features of the notification are:  
• In order to be eligible to issue CP, the satellite dealer has to obtain the specified minimum credit rating 
from   a credit rating agency;  
• At the time of issue of CP, the rating obtained should be current and not more than two months old. The 
minimum specified credit rating should be P-2 (Credit Rating Information Service of India Ltd.(CRISIL)) or 
A-2 (Investment Information & Credit Rating Agency of India Ltd.(ICRA)) or PR-2 (Credit Analysis and 
Research Ltd.(CARE)) or Ind D-2 (Duff & Phelps Credit Rating India Pvt. Ltd.(DCR INDIA)).  
• The CP will be issued for maturities between fifteen days and more, but less than one year;  
• Every issue of CP including renewal will be treated as a fresh issue;  
• The CP may be issued in multipies of Rs. 5 lakh, but the amount to be invested by any single investor 
should not be less than Rs. 25 lakh;  
• The total amount of CP proposed to be issued should be raised within a period of two weeks from the 
date of approval by the Reserve Bank;  
• The aggregate amount to be raised through issue of CP by a satellite dealer should not exceed the 
amount fixed by the Reserve Bank for the issue; and  
• No satellite dealer can have the issue of CP underwritten or co-accepted in any manner whatsoever.
