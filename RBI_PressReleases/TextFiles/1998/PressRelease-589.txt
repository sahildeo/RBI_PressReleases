Report of The High-Level Committee on Agricultural Credit through Commercial Banks 
Foreword 
It was a privilege to be asked to head the RBI Committee on agricultural credit. I have approached the subject as a 
practical administrator, balancing the view point of the farmer for adequate and timely finance, and that of the banker 
for a viable loan portfolio. Travelling through various parts of the country and meeting farmers, bankers, extension 
workers, district officers and others in the field has been a learning experience and I have understood some of what is 
happening in the agricultural sector.  
 
I have received full cooperation from Governments as well as banks and great care has been taken to plan the field 
visits in a purposeful manner. I have been helped very considerably by the sound counsel and advice of Shri Y.S.P. 
Thorat of the Reserve Bank of India, who took time off from his sabbatical to accompany me on some of the tours, and 
also helped me to formulate many of the views which form a part of the report. I would like to place on record Shri 
Thorat's outstanding contribution. I would also like to acknowledge the contribution of all others who have helped in 
making my task worthwhile.
