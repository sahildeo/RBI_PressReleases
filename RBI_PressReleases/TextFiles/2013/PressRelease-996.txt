RBI announces measures to rationalise  
Foreign Exchange Outflows by Resident  Indians 
Keeping in view the current macroeconomic situation, the Reserve Bank of 
India has today announced the following measures:  
(i)  Reduced the limit for Overseas Direct Investment (ODI) under automatic route 
for all fresh ODI transactions, from 400% of the net worth of an Indian Party to 
100% of its net worth. This reduced limit would also apply to remittances made 
under the ODI scheme by Indian Companies for setting up unincorporated 
entities outside India in the energy and natural resources sectors. This 
reduction in limit, however, would not apply to ODI by Navratna PSUs, ONGC 
Videsh Limited and Oil India in overseas unincorporated entities and 
incorporated entities, in the oil sector. 
(ii)  Reduced the limit for remittances made by Resident Individuals, under the 
Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS Scheme), from USD 200,000 to USD 
75,000 per financial year. Resident Individuals have, however, now been 
allowed to set up Joint Venture (JV)/Wholly Owned Subsidiary (WOS) outside 
India under the ODI route within the revised LRS limit.   
(iii)  While current restrictions on the use of LRS for prohibited transactions, such 
as, margin trading and lottery would continue, use of LRS for acquisition of 
immovable property outside India directly or indirectly will, henceforth, not be 
allowed.  
  The present set of measures is aimed at moderating outflows. However, any 
genuine requirement beyond these limits will continue to be considered by RBI under 
the approval route.
