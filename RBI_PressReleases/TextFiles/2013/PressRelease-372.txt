Quarterly Order Books, Inventories and Capacity Utilisation Survey: 
July-September 2013 (Round 23) 
rd 
The Reserve Bank of India has launched the 23 round of its Order Books, 
Inventories and Capacity Utilisation Survey (OBICUS). The survey is for the reference 
period July-September 2013.  
The Reserve Bank has been conducting Order Books, Inventories and Capacity 
Utilisation Survey (OBICUS) of the manufacturing sector on a quarterly basis. The survey 
seeks quantitative information on order books, inventories and capacity utilisation, such 
as, pending order books, backlog order books, total inventories, finished goods 
inventories, work in progress inventories, installed capacity, quantity produced, capacity 
utilisation, value of production, etc., from companies involved in manufacturing activities. 
The information on installed capacity, quantity produced, value of production, etc., is 
used for calculating the capacity utilisation at industry as well as at an all India level. The 
survey has been providing a significant input to the Reserve Bank in monetary policy 
formulation.  
  The salient features of this survey results at the aggregate level are published in 
Macroeconomic and Monetary Developments (MMD) with data release in every quarter. 
A detailed article based on the results for the quarter ending October 2011 to September 
2012 was published in March 2013 issue of the RBI monthly bulletin. 
  M/s Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy Pvt. Ltd. (CMIE), Mumbai, has been 
mandated to conduct the survey for this quarter on behalf of the Reserve Bank of India. 
The major manufacturing companies will be approached by the agency during the 
quarter. Other manufacturing companies that are not approached by the agency can also 
participate in this survey round by downloading the survey schedule from the Reserve 
Bank’s website www.rbi.org.in. The survey schedule is placed under the head Forms and
