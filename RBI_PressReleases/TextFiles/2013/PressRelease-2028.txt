The Reserve Bank of India has today signed the first Currency Swap 
Agreement with the Royal Monetary Authority of Bhutan. The Royal Monetary 
Authority of Bhutan can make drawals of US Dollar, Euro or Indian Rupee in multiple 
tranches up to a maximum of US$ 100 million or its equivalent.  This is expected to 
further economic co-operation between the two countries. 
The agreement is valid for a period of three years from the date of signing. 
It may be recalled that in May 2012, Governor Dr. D. Subbarao had 
announced in the SAARCFINANCE Governors’ meeting, held in Pokhara, Nepal, that 
the Reserve Bank of India would offer swap facilities aggregating US$ 2 billion, both 
in foreign currency and Indian Rupee to our neighbouring countries of the SAARC 
region. The facility is available to all SAARC member countries, viz., Afghanistan, 
Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. The swap 
arrangement is intended to provide a backstop line of funding for the SAARC 
member countries to meet any balance of payments and liquidity crises till longer 
term arrangements are made or if there is need for short-term liquidity due to market 
turbulence. The arrangement will also further financial stability in the region.
