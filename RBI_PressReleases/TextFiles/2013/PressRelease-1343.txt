RBI releases Financial Stability Report: June 2013  
The latest issue of the Financial Stability Report (FSR) of the Reserve Bank of 
India, the seventh in the series, is being released at a time when debate about the 
appropriateness, timing and pace of imminent exit from unconventional monetary policies 
by the US is intensifying and the consequent tremors are being felt in financial markets 
across the globe.  
The FSR aims to create awareness about the vulnerabilities in the financial 
system, to inform about the resilience to stress of the financial institutions and to 
encourage debate on issues relating to development and regulation of the financial 
sector.  
The Report reflects the collective assessment of the Sub-Committee of the 
Financial Stability and Development Council (FSDC) on risks to financial stability. 
Highlights: 
i. Global growth remains subdued and recovery is multi-paced. Policy actions in 
advanced economies had reduced the risks of tail events. The Federal Reserve’s 
indication of a tapering of its bond buying programme, commencing later this year, 
has led to large scale sell offs in foreign exchange, bond and equity markets, 
especially in emerging markets.  (Paras 1.1-1.4; Chapter: I)  
ii. The risks, which have been building up over the last five years of excess liquidity 
in the global system are now surfacing. The markets, especially, in emerging 
economies need to be prepared for spells of high volatility and uncertainty going 
ahead.  (Paras 1.5-1.10; Chapter: I ) 
iii. Macroeconomic risks facing the Indian economy have increased during the last 
six months, mainly on the dimensions of domestic growth, external sector and 
corporate sector performance. Current account deficit and its non- disruptive 
financing have emerged as major challenges from the perspective of 
macroeconomic stability. The recent fall in inflation and significant fiscal 
consolidation have provided some relief. (Paras 1.11-1.20; Chapter: I ) 
iv. The performance of Indian corporate sector has been sluggish and in the 
emerging scenario, the increased external borrowing and un-hedged foreign 
exchange exposures of corporates may further increase their 
vulnerabilities.(Paras 1.33 – 1.34; Chapter: I ) 
v. The risks to the banking sector have increased marginally since the publication of 
the last FSR in December 2012. Tight liquidity and deteriorating asset quality are 
the major contributors to the decline in stability of the banking system over this 
period, although the asset quality of SCBs, has recorded marginal improvement in 
March 2013 quarter. (Paras 2.1, 2.32; Chapter: II) 
vi. The network of the Indian financial system shows that asset management 
companies, insurance companies and Non-Banking Financial companies 
(NBFCs) have a high degree of connectivity with the banking system.  (Paras 2.7-
2.15; Chapter: II)

vii. A significant degree of ‘seasonality’ is seen in the performance of banks on the 
parameters of credit, deposit, and asset quality during the last quarter of the 
financial year. (Paras 2.18-2.20 and 2.34; Chapter: II) 
viii. Banks with higher leverage were observed to have lower risk-weight-asset 
density. Globally, this trend is observed when banks graduate to an internal 
ratings based (IRB) approach under Basel II. (Para 2.29: Chapter: II and Paras 
3.4 – 3.7; Chapter: III) 
ix. Stress tests results indicate that if the current macroeconomic conditions persist, 
the credit quality of commercial banks could deteriorate further. However, the 
comfortable position on the banks’ capital adequacy front lends resilience. (Paras 
2.46-2.57, Chapter: II) 
x. A major part of the new business premium in life insurance is from single premium 
policies with rising ticket size.  (Paras 2.77-2.78, Chapter: II) 
xi. In respect of the many Defined Benefit pension fund schemes, currently under 
implementation as well as newly announced (mostly in the government sector), 
the weaknesses in liability computation can be a potential source of fiscal stress in 
years when there are large payouts, especially in a world of rising life expectancy. 
(Paras 2.80-2.82, Chapter II) 
xii. The emerging inconsistencies in regulatory approach and a tendency towards 
home-bias in some of the major jurisdictions, while implementing reforms, may 
affect the functioning of international as well as domestic financial markets. Inter-
regulatory agency implementation groups have been formed, with focus on 
implementation of specific areas of reforms in India.                                             
(Paras 3.1-3.3; Chapter: III) 
xiii. The financial sector regulators have signed a Memorandum of Understanding 
(MoU) for co-operation in the field of consolidated supervision and monitoring of 
financial groups identified as financial conglomerates. Bilateral Memoranda of 
Understanding (MoU) have been signed with overseas supervisory bodies, and 
Supervisory Colleges established for two big Indian banks for improved cross 
border banking supervision and cooperation. (Paras 3.30 -3-32; Chapter: III)  
xiv. Instances of mis-selling of financial products, mainly insurance products and other 
wealth management services at some banks have underscored the need for 
strengthening consumer protection mechanisms and ensuring adherence to KYC / 
AML guidelines.  (Paras 3.47 – 3.58; Chapter: III)  
xv. India has been proactive in implementing a framework for regulating the practice 
of algorithmic trading and steps have been taken to address the risks from 
erroneous trades. SEBI is examining the risks from algorithmic and high 
frequency trading and aims to provide greater equality and fairness in order 
handling to the participants who do not use co-location services. (Paras 3.68 – 
3.71; Chapter: III)  
xvi. The latest Systemic Risk Survey of the Reserve Bank conducted during April-May 
2013 revealed that global risks and domestic macro-economic risks were 
perceived to be the two most important factors affecting the stability of Indian 
financial system. (Annex 1 to the FSR)
