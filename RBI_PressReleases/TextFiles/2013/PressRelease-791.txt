RBI penalises Jamia Cooperative Bank Ltd, 2/9, 
Surya Complex, Sarai Julena, Okhla Road, New Delhi - 110025 
 
The Reserve Bank of India has imposed a monetary penalty of `2 lakh 
(` Two lakh ) on Jamia Cooperative  Bank Ltd, 2/9, Surya Complex, Sarai 
Jullena, Okhla Road, New Delhi -110025. The penalty has been imposed on 
the bank for violation of (i) Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti Money 
Laundering (AML) norms insofar as carrying out sufficient customer 
identification procedures, ascertaining the identification of natural persons 
behind entities, carrying out enhanced due diligence and appropriate risk 
categorisation were concerned; (ii) non-compliance of Income Recognition 
and Asset Classification (IRAC) norms by transfer of funds from one account 
to another; (iii) involvement of the directors in day-to-day affairs of the bank; 
and (iv) diversion of funds from loan accounts through current/savings bank 
accounts of borrowers to firms in which directors have an interest.  
 
The Reserve Bank of India had issued a show cause notice to the bank 
in response to which the bank submitted a written reply. After considering the 
facts of the case and the bank’s reply in the matter, the Reserve Bank came to 
the conclusion that the violations were substantiated and warranted imposition 
of the penalty. It, therefore, imposed the penalty on it in exercise of powers 
vested in it under the provisions of Section 47A(1)(b) read with Section 46(4) 
of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (As Applicable to Co-operative Societies).
