RBI issues Policy Document for Regulation and  
Supervision of Financial Market Infrastructures 
The Reserve Bank of India has today released a policy document on 
Regulation and Supervision of Financial Market Infrastructures regulated by it. The 
policy on supervision and regulation of the FMIs regulated by the Reserve Bank 
describes in detail the criteria for designating an FMI, applicability of PFMIs to the 
FMIs, oversight of FMIs and other related aspects. The financial market 
infrastructures regulated by the Reserve Bank include Real Time Gross Settlement 
(RTGS), Securities Settlement Systems (SSSs), Clearing Corporation of India Ltd. 
(CCIL) and Negotiated Dealing System (NDS).  
Background 
The Reserve Bank, as a member of Financial Stability Board (FSB) and of 
CPSS, is committed to the adoption and implementation of the “Principles for FMIs”. 
The commitment is outlined in its vision document on Payment Systems in India for 
2012-15 (Chapter-3: Assurance through Risk Management and Oversight).  
The Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS) and 
International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) had issued the 
“Principles for Financial Market Infrastructure” (PFMIs) in April 2012. The principles - 
24 for the financial market infrastructures and five responsibilities for the relevant 
public authorities - were issued to enhance safety and efficiency in payment, clearing, 
settlement and recording arrangements and, more broadly, to limit systemic risk and 
foster transparency and financial stability. The members of CPSS and IOSCO are 
required to strive to adopt the PFMI in their respective jurisdictions in line with G-20 
expectations.
