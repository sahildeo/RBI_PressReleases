Quarterly Industrial Outlook Survey: October-December 2013 (Round 64) 
th
 The Reserve Bank of India has launched the 64 round of the Industrial 
Outlook Survey (IOS) for reference period October-December 2013. The Reserve 
Bank has been conducting the Industrial Outlook Survey on a quarterly basis since 
1998. The survey gives an insight into the perception of the public and private limited 
companies engaged in manufacturing activities about their own performance and 
prospects. The survey covers non-financial private and public limited companies with 
a good size/industry representation. The assessment of business sentiments for the 
current quarter and expectations for the ensuing quarter are based on qualitative 
responses to 23 major parameters covering overall business situation, financial 
situation, demand indicators, price and employment expectations, profit margins, etc. 
The survey provides useful forward looking inputs for policymakers, analysts and 
business alike. 
 The salient features of this survey results at the aggregate level are published 
in Macroeconomic and Monetary Developments with data release in every quarter. A 
detailed article based on the results for the quarter April-June 2012-13 to January-
March 2012-13 was published in July 2013 issue of the RBI monthly Bulletin. The 
article can also be viewed or downloaded from the RBI website http://www.rbi.org.in. 
 M/s Centre for Research Planning and Action (CERPA), New Delhi has been 
authorised to conduct the survey for this quarter on behalf of the Reserve Bank of 
India. Manufacturing companies will be approached by this agency during the 
quarter. However, other manufacturing companies who are not approached by the 
agency can also participate in this survey by downloading the survey schedule from 
the Reserve Bank’s website www.rbi.org.in. The survey schedule is placed under the
