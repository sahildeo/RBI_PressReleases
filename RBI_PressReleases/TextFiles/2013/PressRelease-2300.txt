Report of the Committee to Assess the Feasibility of introducing more 
Long-Term Fixed Interest Rate Loan Products by Banks 
 
The Reserve Bank of India has today placed on its website the report of the 
Committee to Assess the Feasibility of Introducing more Long-Term Fixed Rate Loan 
Products by Banks. 
 
Some of the important recommendations made by the Committee are: 
? The banks which have not issued long-term  bonds (minimum maturity of 
5 years) to the extent of their exposure to the infrastructure sector 
(minimum residual maturity of 5 years) could utilize the room available to 
issue more Long Term bonds which would help release resources for 
extending long-term fixed rate loan products. 
? Banks should popularize the Fixed Deposit schemes with tenors of above 5 
years as the same are eligible for tax exemption. This would to some 
extent meet the long-term funding requirement of banks.         
? The Indian financial system has G-Secs upto 30 years, a benchmark to 
issue and price 30 year bonds by banks. Banks could, therefore, make 
efforts to offer longer-tenor fixed rate loans, say upto 30 years which 
would help reduce the EMIs of the borrowers.  
? Large institutional investors like Pension Funds, Provident Funds, 
Insurance Companies, etc. should be encouraged to invest in bonds 
issued by banks.  
? Fixed rate long-term loan products with periodic interest reset provision 
(say every 7-10 years) may be offered by banks in addition to plain vanilla 
fixed rate loan products. However, banks should take care that the 
resetting of interest rate does not violate regulatory guidelines on base 
rate.                                                                      
??? ??????????????? Banks may explore the option of take-out financing. In addition, banks 
may explore promoting securitization market for better asset liability 
management. 
? Banks should charge pre-payment penalty on fixed rate loan products on 
the outstanding amount only. Further, penalty should be reasonable so 
that it does not act as a disincentive for the fixed rate loan borrowers. 
? Banks and Indian Banks Association should play a prominent role in 
educating customers regarding possible impact of rate changes on their 
equated monthly instalments. 
 
RBI would examine and initiate appropriate action on the recommendations 
made by the Committee. 
 
It may be recalled that in terms of the announcement made in the Annual Policy 
Statement for the Year 2012-13 (para 104), a Committee comprising officials from 
commercial banks, Reserve Bank and other stakeholders was constituted under the 
Chairmanship of Shri K.K. Vohra, CGM, Internal Debt Management Department,
