Meaningful Financial Inclusion hinges on  
Commercial Banks’ Ability to meet Credit Gaps of the Poor:  
Finding of RBI’s Research Project Study in Kerala  
The Reserve Bank today released a Research Project Study titled “How the 
Poor Manage their Finances: A Study of the Portfolio Choices of Poor Households in 
Ernakulam District, Kerala” on its website. The Research Project Study is a 
collaborative outcome of researchers associated with the Centre for Socio-Economic 
and Environmental Studies (CSES), Kochi and Reserve Bank of India.   
A survey was conducted for the purpose of this Study, on a sample size of   
107 poor households in Ernakulum district in Kerala. The Study also employed a 
case study approach in tracking the financial lives of poor households. 
The information on both stock and flow variables pertaining to 107 households 
was collected through the survey based approach. While the financial diary method 
was employed to collect information on cash flows, a questionnaire was administered 
to collect information on stock variables. The Project Study thus also presents a 
collection of case studies showcasing the cash management strategies followed by 
the poor households.  
Major findings of the Project Study include:  
(i) The challenges faced by the poor households in the sample are not only 
insufficient income, but also irregular and unpredictable income flows. The 
poor need credit for meeting frequent gaps in income inflows and 
consumption outflows.  
(ii) A never ending cycle of lending and borrowing small amounts is observed 
among the poor households. When the shortfall is for meeting daily 
expenses, the households mostly depend on hand loans from friends and 
neighbours. However, if the need is for raising large amount for purposes, 
such as, house construction, purchase of land, etc., poor households also 
seek the support of formal institutions, mostly cooperative societies. The 
Study finds that cooperative societies have been more flexible in meeting 
the cash needs of the poor as compared to commercial banks.  
The Study concludes that meaningful financial inclusion of the poor by the 
commercial banks depends on their ability to meet the credit gaps of the poor 
households. 
The Reserve Bank has introduced a “Research Project Study/Report Series” 
with a view to disseminating the research output undertaken with the support of 
external experts under the Reserve Bank’s Scheme for support of economic research 
in areas like real economy, monetary sector, financial economics etc.  This would 
available in its website under ‘Publications>Occasional>>Project Research Study’

Research Project Studies/Reports are another effort made by the Reserve 
Bank for encouraging policy-oriented research and also providing data and reports 
for researchers at large. The Research Projects being funded under the scheme are 
assigned to external research institutions/scholars wherein internal researchers are 
also associated for collaborative research. On completion of these research projects, 
these studies are released on the Reserve Bank’s website for wider circulation with a 
view to generating constructive discussion among economists and policy makers on 
subjects of current interest.
