RBI Working Paper Series 5 / 2013: Persistence of Informal Credit in Rural 
India: Regulatory Policies Need to Recognise Changing Rural Landscape 
The Reserve Bank today placed on its website a Working Paper titled 
“Persistence of Informal Credit in Rural India: Evidence from ‘All-India Debt and 
Investment Survey’ and Beyond” under the RBI Working Paper Series. The paper 
has been authored by Dr. Narayan Chandra Pradhan. 
Rural credit market in India is characterised by the coexistence of both formal 
and informal sources of finance and the market is fragmented.  
The paper chronicles both ‘All-India Rural Credit Survey 1951-52’ (RBI, 1954) 
and ‘All-India Rural Debt and Investment Survey 1961-62’ (RBI, 1965) conducted by 
the Reserve Bank and four rounds of All-India Debt and Investment Surveys by 
‘National Sample Survey Organisation’ (NSSO) of the Government of India from 
1971-72 to 2002-03. To discuss the informal rural credit issue and to maintain 
consistency with All India Debt and Investment Survey (AIDIS) data, this paper treats 
credit supplied by non-institutional agencies as informal and that of institutional 
agencies as formal sources of credit. In the absence of further survey data, to extend 
discussion on rural credit scenario including ‘Micro Finance Institutions’ (MFIs) 
beyond 2002, the paper has heavily drawn upon four recent official Reports.  
The paper makes an attempt to assess the share of rural informal credit in 
total outstanding debt which has been decreasing over the period from 1950 to 2002 
with various financial inclusion initiatives of the Reserve Bank and legislations of the 
various State Governments to regulate moneylenders. However, about two-fifth of the 
rural households’ dependence on informal credit indicates further scope for financial 
inclusion in rural areas.  
Major findings of the paper are: 
? The share of institutional credit agencies in the outstanding cash dues of the 
rural households at the all-India level increased from 29 per cent in 1971 to 61 
per cent in 1981;  the pace of increase was arrested subsequently to 64 per 
cent in 1991. During 1990s, the share declined and reached 57 per cent in 
2002. 
? The period of distress in agriculture in the 2000s is also identified with a 
relatively declining contribution of cooperatives in agricultural credit, and with 
RRBs not showing substantial increase in agricultural credit, indicating the 
urgent need to ensure increased access to agricultural credit for small and 
marginal farmers.

? Rural borrowers prefer to use informal sources of credit despite the fact that 
they charge much higher interest rates. This is perhaps because informal 
sources do not insist on regular repayment as banks or cooperative credit 
societies do. Usually, it is possible to obtain loans for such purposes as 
marriage and attending to litigation only from informal sources and without 
collaterals.  
? There is a need for regulatory policies to recognise the changing rural 
landscape, adapt to new realities and bring in suitable changes as many of the 
informal players are not included in the existing regulatory framework on 
money lending. 
This calls for financial sector initiatives in the form of prompt and innovative 
policy responses to prioritise financial inclusion, financial education as well as 
financial literacy.
