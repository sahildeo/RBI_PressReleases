RBI Announces Additional Liquidity Support Through  
14-day Term Repo Auction  
 
 
 The Reserve Bank has been closely monitoring liquidity conditions so as to 
ensure that adequate liquidity is available to support the flow of credit to the 
productive sectors of the economy. As the liquidity conditions are expected to 
tighten on account of advance tax payments commencing from mid-December 
2013, Reserve Bank has decided to provide additional liquidity of 10,000 crore 
through the 14-day term repo scheduled to be conducted on December 13, 2013 
(Friday). Accordingly, the notified amount for the 14-day term repo auction to be 
conducted on December 13, 2013 will be adjusted upwards by  10,000 crore.
