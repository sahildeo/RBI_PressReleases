Macroeconomic and Monetary Developments : 
Third Quarter Review 2012-13 
The Reserve Bank of India today released the Macroeconomic and Monetary 
Developments Third Quarter Review 2012-13. The document serves as a backdrop to 
the Third Quarter Review of Monetary Policy Statement 2012-13 to be announced on 
January 29, 2013.  
Highlights:   
Overall Outlook 
Balance of macroeconomic risks suggests monetary policy needs to be 
calibrated in addressing growth risks as inflation turns sticky  
• Growth in 2012-13 is likely to fall below the Reserve Bank’s baseline projection 
of 5.8 per cent. However, output gap may start closing in 2013-14 although at a 
slow pace on the back of some revival in investment and consumption demand. 
• Inflation is likely to moderate below the Reserve Bank’s baseline projection of 
7.5 per cent. However, suppressed inflation continues to pose a significant risk 
to the inflation in 2013-14. As some of the risks materialises, inflation path may 
turn sticky. 
• Various surveys show that business confidence remains subdued. Survey 
shows that forecasters outside the Reserve Bank anticipate growth to recover 
from 5.5 per cent in 2012-13 to 6.5 per cent in 2013-14. Average WPI inflation 
is expected to moderate from 7.5 per cent in 2012-13 to 7.0 per cent in 2013-
14. 
Global Economic Conditions 
Unconventional monetary policies reduce stress, but risks remain ahead  
• Fiscal risks are likely to keep global recovery muted in 2013. While the 
immediate risk of the fiscal cliff in the US has been averted, risks to global 
growth emanating from euro area remain significant. There are some signs of 
growth bottoming out in Emerging Market and Developing Economies 
(EMDEs).    
• Global inflation scenario may stay benign as demand in advanced economies 
(AEs) remains weak. Improved supply prospects in commodities like oil and 
food are likely to restrain commodity price pressures. However, upside risks 
persist, with possible recovery in EMDEs and large quantitative easing in AEs.

Indian Economy 
Output 
Growth slowdown continues, revival may take some more time  
• Growth slowdown in India continues with growth remaining below potential for 
the fifth successive quarter. Policy initiatives of the government are yet to show 
up fully or definitively in data. Revival may take some more time.  
• Rabi crop is expected to be normal despite deficient rains, but is unlikely to fully 
compensate for kharif deficiency. Sowing under rabi crop has been broadly the 
same as the level in the previous year.    
• Weak industrial performance is likely to persist. Subdued external demand and 
lack of reliable power supply amidst coal shortages are constraining capacity 
utilisation. Lead indicators of service sector and the Reserve Bank’s Service 
Sector Composite Indicator signal moderation.  
• The Reserve Banks’ Order Books, Inventory and Capacity Utilisation Survey 
shows capacity utilisation increased marginally in Q2 of 2012-13. On a 
sequential basis, new orders moderated in Q2 of 2012-13. 
Aggregate Demand 
Improvement in investment climate is a prerequisite for economic recovery 
• Demand conditions remained tepid, with private consumption continuing to 
decelerate and with investment yet to recover.  
• Investment intentions in new projects improved marginally in Q2 of 2012-13, 
but investment is held back by project delays. Coal supply issues facing power 
sectors are yet to be fully resolved. Road investments have stalled due to 
issues relating to environmental clearances, land acquisition and financial 
closures.  
• Sales growth moderated further in Q2 of 2012-13 to its lowest level in three 
years, but net profit growth improved markedly. Early results for Q3 of 2012-13 
indicate continuation of the trend of sluggish sales.  
• Quality of fiscal adjustment remains a concern, even as fiscal risks have 
reduced in 2012-13. Government is working towards achieving revised fiscal 
deficit target of 5.3 per cent of GDP by restricting both plan and non-plan 
expenditure during the last quarter of the year, even as significant shortfall in 
tax revenue is likely.   
• Increased public investment to crowd in private investment along with removal 
of structural impediments that is slowing private investment is needed to pull 
the economy out of the current slowdown.  
External Sector 
Widening of CAD and its financing remains a key policy challenge 
• Widening current account deficit (CAD) has emerged as a major constraint in 
easing monetary policy. With the likelihood that CAD/GDP ratio may exceed 4 
per cent of GDP for the second successive year in 2012-13, prudence is 
necessary while stimulating aggregate demand.  
• The CAD/GDP ratio reached its highest ever peak of 5.4 per cent of GDP in Q2 
of 2012-13. Early indications are that it may increase further in Q3 of 2012-13. 
CAD has widened mainly due to worsening trade deficit.  
• Weak external demand alongside structural bottlenecks has led to contraction 
in exports of India as also of other EMDEs. In addition, continuing large imports 
of oil and gold has resulted in deterioration in India’s trade balance. 3 
 
• Strong capital flows have facilitated financing of CAD, resulting only in marginal 
draw down of reserves. While increased FII debt investment limits may 
enhance inflows, they do not provide a solution to CAD financing on a 
sustainable basis. 
Monetary and Liquidity Conditions 
With moderating inflation, Reserve Bank takes measures to infuse liquidity 
• Since the start of 2012, the Reserve Bank has worked towards easing 
monetary and liquidity conditions in a calibrated manner without jeopardising 
moderating inflation. With consequent moderation in inflation, the Reserve 
Bank took measures to combat tight liquidity conditions. 
• Liquidity conditions tightened in Q3 of 2012-13 due to build up of government 
cash balances and strong currency demand. The Reserve Bank resumed 
outright open market operations (OMOs). In 2012-13 so far, it has infused 
liquidity of `1.3 trillion through outright OMOs. 
• Broad money growth remains below indicative trajectory. Deposit growth has 
decelerated, while credit expansion has been in line with the trajectory. Even as 
asset quality concerns have impacted credit expansion, the increased wedge 
between deposit and credit growth remains a concern. 
Financial Markets 
Reforms and inflows improve market sentiments and revive the IPO market 
• Improved global liquidity  and recent policy reforms have aided FII inflows, 
leading to a turnaround in equity markets and revival of the Initial Public 
Offering (IPO) market.   
• Rupee remained largely range-bound in Q3 of 2012-13. Money market 
remained stable despite liquidity deficit. G-sec yields softened markedly since 
December 2012 on expectations of no additional government borrowing and 
policy rate cut, as also resumption of OMOs and deferment of an auction.   
• The Reserve Bank’s House Price Index (HPI) increased by 3 per cent quarter-
on-quarter in Q2 of 2012-13 alongside increase in transaction volumes. 
Price Situation 
Headline and core inflation moderated, but suppressed inflation poses risks  
• Headline inflation moderated in Q3 of 2012-13 with significant moderation of 
core inflation, but CPI inflation edged up to double digits. Core inflation 
pressures are unlikely to re-emerge quickly on demand-side considerations. 
Near-term inflation outlook indicates that the moderation may continue in Q4 of 
2012-13.  
• Wage inflation remains a source of concern. Rural wage inflation declined 
marginally but remained high at 18 per cent. In organised manufacturing, 
increases in staff costs remained in double digits.  
• Going forward, risks remain from suppressed inflation, pressure on food prices 
and high inflation expectations getting entrenched into the wage price spiral. 
The inflation path for 2013-14 could face downward rigidity.
