 Survey on Foreign Collaboration in Indian Industry: 2007- 2010  
The Reserve Bank of India today released, on its website, the data related to 
the results of the Survey on Foreign Collaboration in Indian Industry: 2007-2010. 
The survey captures comprehensive information relating to the nature, pattern, 
and operations of Indian companies having technical collaboration with foreign 
companies valid during the period April 2007 to March 2010 or part thereof. Apart 
from the information related to technical collaboration agreement, the survey also 
collected the information on equity participation as at end-March 2007-2010.  
Out of 836 Indian companies that responded to the survey, as per the 
Schedule, 158 companies reported 160 foreign technical collaboration agreements.  
The highlights of the survey results based on such foreign technical 
collaboration agreements are presented in section I and the results based on all 836 
reporting companies having foreign equity participation and/or technical collaboration 
are presented in section II below: 
th
Highlights: 8 Round 
I. Foreign Technical Collaboration Companies  
• Coverage: Out of the 158 companies which had entered into foreign technical 
collaboration agreements during the period 2007-08 to 2009-10, 129 were 
subsidiaries, 19 were associates having equity participation and 10 had pure 
technical collaboration (PTCC) (Table 1).  
• Industry-wise distribution of agreements: Foreign collaboration companies 
indicated that the share of manufacturing sector in the total foreign technical 
collaboration agreements had declined from the seventh round of the survey 
period to the present eighth round of survey while the share of service sector 
had increased (Table 2). 
• Country-wise distribution of agreements: The top four countries, in terms of 
source of technology transfer, were United States, Germany, United Kingdom 
and Japan in the present round of survey (Table 3). 
• Type of assets transferred: Agreements providing know-how transfer 
accounted for a major share of the foreign technical collaboration agreements. 
However, the share of agreements providing only know-how transfer declined 
from the seventh round of survey to the present survey (Table 4).

• Modes of Payment: The share of agreements involving royalty, lump-sum 
technical fees and both royalty and lump-sum technical fees stood at 26.3 per 
cent, 28.7 per cent and 45.0 per cent, respectively, according to the survey 
(Table 5).  
• Export restrictive clauses: The proportion of foreign technical collaboration 
agreements with export restrictive clauses declined significantly in the 
manufacturing sector as per the present survey. The survey also highlighted 
that the share of agreements with export restrictive clauses declined in most of 
the countries (Table 6 and 7). 
• Provision of exclusive rights: The proportion of agreements providing the 
exclusive rights on assets transferred under the agreements declined as per 
the survey except for the textile and electrical equipment sector. The provision 
of exclusive rights provided in the foreign collaboration agreement to an Indian 
company restricts the foreign collaborator from transferring such assets to any 
other parties operating in India  (Table 8).    
• Value of Production: The total value of production reported by the foreign 
collaboration companies covered in the present survey increased from ` 604.8 
billion in 2007-08 to ` 822.4 billion in 2009-10. The share of manufacturing 
sector in the total production declined but the share of services sector in total 
production improved mainly due to increase in computer and related services 
(Table 9 and 10).  
• Employment: The number of employees in the responding foreign 
collaboration companies increased from 62,166 in 2007-08 to 71,268 in 2010 
(Table 11).   
• Profitability: The profitability of foreign collaboration companies measured by 
ratio of gross profit to the capital employed declined from 14.1 per cent in 
2007-08 to 6.9 per cent in 2008-09; however it recovered to 12.8 per cent in 
2009-10 (Table 12).   
• Exports: Total exports of the foreign collaboration companies covered in the 
present survey increased from `120.7 billion in 2007-08 to ` 156.7 billion in 
2009-10. Manufacturing sector had a dominant share in exports (Table 13). 
• Imports: Total imports made by the foreign collaboration companies covered 
in the present survey increased from ` 275.0 billion in 2007-08 to ` 342.3 
billion in 2008-09 but declined to ` 299.0 billion in 2009-10. Import payments 
were dominantly made by the manufacturing sector among the foreign 
collaboration companies (Table 14). 
• R&D Expenditure: R&D intensity measured as the ratio of R&D expenditure 
to the value of production declined for both manufacturing as well as service 
sector from 2007-08 to 2009-10 (Table 15).

(Table17).  
• Industry wise-Foreign Equity: Data on companies covered in the present 
survey showed an increase in the share of foreign equity participation in 
services sector. The services sector and construction sector recorded a 
considerable increase in the foreign equity participation. The subsidiary 
companies had reflected similar trend during 2007-2010 (Table18 and 
Table19).
