RBI releases clarifications to the queries on the  
Guidelines for Licensing of New Banks in the Private Sector 
The Reserve Bank of India today released on its website, clarifications to 
queries on the Guidelines for Licensing of New Banks in the Private Sector.
The Reserve Bank of India released the Guidelines for Licensing of New 
Banks in the Private Sector on its website on February 22, 2013. Following the issue 
of the guidelines, RBI issued a press release on March 7, 2013 inviting queries from 
intending applicants seeking clarifications on the guidelines and also stated that 
considering that the clarifications provided would be of wider interest and use for all 
intending applicants, the Reserve Bank would post the clarifications on its website.   
In all, RBI has received 443 queries from 34 individuals/ organisations. Upto 
the end of March 31, 2013, RBI had received 71 queries from 9 individuals/ 
organisations. As many as 330 queries from 19 individuals/ organisations were 
th th
received between 5 to 10 April, 2013, of which 240 queries from 10 individuals/ 
organisations were received on April 10, 2013, i.e. on the last date. Further, 42 
queries were received after April 10, 2013. The clarifications to all the queries have 
been provided. A few queries have been clubbed with other related queries for the 
sake of clarity and continuity. 
A good number of queries have brought out issues relating to the provisions in 
the guidelines on the eligible promoters, ‘fit and proper’ criteria, corporate structure of 
the Non-Operative Financial Holding Company (NOFHC), foreign shareholding and 
on transition time to the new structure.  While interpreting the replies, it must be kept 
in view that though the replies are specific to the questions, these must be seen in 
the wider context of the guidelines. 
What’s New: 
Validity period of the in-principle approval 
As per the guidelines for licensing of new banks in the private sector issued 
vide RBI Press Release dated February 22, 2013, the validity of the in-principle 
approval for setting up of the NOFHC / bank was one year from the date of issue and 
would lapse automatically, thereafter.

The queries received from intending applicants brought out several complex 
issues pertaining to re-organisation of the existing corporate structure, restructuring 
of businesses and meeting the regulatory requirements. In the above context, RBI 
has been requested to clarify as to whether it would provide more time for a smooth 
transition from the existing structures to that prescribed in the guidelines as also for 
meeting the regulatory requirements. It has therefore, been decided to extend the 
validity period of the in-principle approval from one year to 18 months. Accordingly, 
the provisions at para 4(K) (vi) of the guidelines stand modified.  It is expected that 
this would provide sufficient time for the Promoters/Promoter Group to comply with 
the various stipulations in the guidelines and the terms and conditions that would be 
set out while granting the in-principle approvals to successful applicants. 
Applicability of norms of other regulators 
Some of the provisions in the guidelines relate to Non-operative Financial 
Holding Company (NOFHC) structure which envisages holding of the bank and other 
regulated financial services entities of the Promoters/Promoter Group under the 
NOFHC and prudential exposure norms for the regulated entities.  These 
requirements overlap with regulatory norms prescribed by other sectoral regulators 
like SEBI and IRDA. In this regard, queries were raised on adherence to different 
sector specific requirements. Such issues were examined in consultation with SEBI 
and IRDA.  It has been decided that while the structure prescribed in the guidelines is 
the preferred structure, the intending applicants should approach the other financial 
sector regulators for bringing the entities regulated by them under the NOFHC.  Their 
decision in this regard would prevail.  Therefore, at the minimum, the proposed bank 
and all RBI regulated entities will necessarily be under the NOFHC.
