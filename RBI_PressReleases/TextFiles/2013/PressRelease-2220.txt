Investment by FIIs under PIS :   
M/s IRB Infrastructure Developers Ltd and M/s Radico Khaitan Limited 
 The Reserve Bank of India today notified that M/s IRB Infrastructure 
Developers Ltd and M/s Radico Khaitan Limited have passed resolutions at the 
Board of Directors’ level and a special resolution by the shareholders, agreeing for 
enhancing the limit for the purchase of its equity shares and convertible debentures 
by FIIs, through primary market and stock exchanges: (1) Up to 49% (M/s IRB 
Infrastructure Developers Ltd) and (2) Up to 40% (M/s Radico Khaitan Limited) of the 
paid up capital of the company under Portfolio Investment Scheme.  
Since 49% for M/s IRB Infrastructure Developers Ltd & 40% for M/s Radico 
Khaitan Limited are intermediate ceilings fixed for the FIIs by the above companies, 
the Reserve Bank will not be monitoring the same and it will be the company’s 
responsibility to ensure that the applicable cap is not breached. 
This approval is given subject to the condition that the onus of compliance 
with FDI policy and FEMA regulations including downstream investment would 
continue to remain on the Indian companies, M/s IRB Infrastructure Developers Ltd 
and M/s Radico Khaitan Limited.
