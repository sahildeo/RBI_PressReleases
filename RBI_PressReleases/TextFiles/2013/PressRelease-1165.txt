RBI announces Additional measures to address Exchange Market Volatility 
 Over the last two months, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has undertaken 
several measures to contain the volatility in the foreign exchange market. Among 
them, some measures intended to check excessive speculation adding to undue 
volatility in market conditions were instituted vide the RBI's Press Release No.2013-
2014/100 dated July 15, 2013. These measures have had a restraining effect on 
volatility with a concomitant stabilising effect on the exchange rate. Based on a 
review of the measures, and an assessment of the liquidity and overall market 
conditions going forward, it has been decided to modify the liquidity tightening 
measures as follows: 
? The overall limit for access to LAF by each individual bank is set at 0.5 per 
cent of its own NDTL outstanding as on the last Friday of the second 
preceding fortnight. This measure will come into effect immediately, i.e., 
from July 24, 2013 and will remain in force until further notice. 
? Currently, banks are allowed to maintain their Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) 
prescribed by the RBI on an average daily basis during a reporting fortnight, 
with a minimum of 70 per cent of the required CRR on a daily basis. 
Effective from the first day of the next reporting fortnight i.e., from July 27, 
2013, banks will be required to maintain a minimum daily CRR balance of 
99 per cent of the requirement. 
Detailed guidelines regarding these measures are being issued separately.
