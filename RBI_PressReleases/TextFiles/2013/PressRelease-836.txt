RBI clarifies its recently revised Overseas Direct 
Investment Guidelines 
The Reserve Bank of India has today issued certain clarifications with respect to the 
applicability of the revised guidelines in respect of overseas direct investment 
notified on August 14, 2013 to facilitate genuine outward investment requirements of 
the Indian companies. The clarifications/answers to the queries raised by different 
stakeholders are contained in its AP (Dir) Circular No. 30 dated September 04, 2013. 
Among others, it has been clarified that in respect of funding of overseas direct 
investments by way of External Commercial Borrowings, instead of limit of 100 per 
cent of the net worth, the earlier limit of 400 per cent of the net worth will continue to 
apply. 
 
It may be noted that the Reserve Bank of India had announced the revised 
guidelines for overseas direct investment by Indian parties on August 14, 2013. This 
measure had been taken in the context of current macro-economic situation. It was 
not the intention of the Reserve Bank of India to restrict bona-fide and genuine 
overseas direct investment transactions by Indian companies.
