Board of the Reserve Bank of India today. He indicated that the Union Budget 2013-14,

finances. It is expected that the move towards fiscal consolidation will impart confidence 
in the economy, support domestic and foreign investments and will boost supply side 
initiatives.

Budget also focussed on infrastructure investment to restart the growth engine and that it 
has addressed divergent constraints in this regard.  
To protect savings from inflation, especially those of the poor and middle classes, 
the Budget has announced various measures including the introduction of inflation 
indexed bonds. He hoped that these measures would also incentivise the household
