RBI launches Consumer Confidence Survey (CCS) – September 2013 
The Reserve Bank of India has been conducting Consumer Confidence 
Survey of Households (CCS) on a quarterly basis since June 2010. The survey aims 
at capturing subjective assessments of around 5,400 households across 6 
metropolitan cities viz., Bangalore, Chennai, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Mumbai and New 
Delhi. The results of this Survey are being used by Reserve Bank as one of the 
 
important inputs to the monetary policy formulation. The latest round of the Survey 
with September 2013 as the reference period has been launched today. The Survey 
seeks qualitative responses on questions pertaining to economic conditions, and 
household circumstances, income & spending, perceptions on prices, employment 
prospects and major outlays such as gold, car, house, durable goods etc.
