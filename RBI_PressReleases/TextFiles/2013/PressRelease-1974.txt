RBI initiates Scrutiny of Three Banks for Alleged Violation of KYC Guidelines 
The Reserve Bank of India has initiated the process of carrying out 
comprehensive scrutinies covering both, Head Office and branches of three private 
sector banks, namely, ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank and Axis Bank. Apart from this, the 
Reserve Bank has also undertaken a thematic study in respect of banks that are 
active in selling gold coins / wealth management products to examine whether there 
are systemic issues and to plug deficiencies and legal loop-holes, if any.  
 
The scrutinies have been initiated after an online media firm called 
Cobrapost.com, on the basis of its sting operations across some branches of these 
banks alleged violation of several provisions of the Reserve Bank of India 
Regulations, Foreign Exchange Management Act guidelines, etc. The media firm had 
uploaded some videos on the internet relating to these banks as well as ICICI 
Prudential Life Insurance and HDFC Life Insurance. 
 
The final reports on all the three banks will be completed by March 31, 2013 
and thereafter further course of action as necessary will be initiated.
