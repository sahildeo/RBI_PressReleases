RBI’s Technical Committee suggests  
Merger of Issue and Banking Departments Balance Sheet 
 
The Reserve Bank of India placed on its website today, the report of the 
Technical Committee (Chairman: Shri Y. H. Malegam) set up to review the form of 
presentation of the Reserve Bank’s Balance Sheet and Profit & Loss Account. Some 
of the important recommendations made by the Technical Committee are: 
 
a) Form of Balance Sheet 
? Merger of the Issue and Banking Department balance sheets and 
preparation of a single balance sheet displaying at one place the total 
assets and liabilities of the Reserve Bank. 
? Only the main items of capital, reserves, assets and liabilities be 
reported in the Balance Sheet and all details be shown in 
accompanying schedules. 
? In determining the items which are to be shown separately in the 
schedules, items of similar nature can be grouped and shown as a 
single item and other items which are not material in value can be 
grouped and shown as a single item titled ‘Others’. 
 
b) Nomenclature and Form of Profit & Loss Account 
? The nomenclature ‘Profit & Loss account’ may be replaced by the 
nomenclature ‘Income Statement’. 
? A single Profit & Loss account (or as per nomenclature recommended, 
‘Income Statement’) may continue to be prepared. 
? All the unrealised valuation adjustments (gains/losses) on various 
assets arising on translation of foreign currency assets or on marking 
of assets to market, should be routed through the Profit & Loss 
Account, and the corresponding net transfers to the Contingency 
Reserve, Asset Development Reserve, Currency and Gold Revaluation 
Account, Investment Revaluation Account and Exchange Equalisation 
Account be shown as a single item in the Profit & Loss Account 
(Income Statement) under the heading ‘Provisions’. 
? Since interest income is the major source of income for the Reserve 
Bank, all items of a non interest earning nature be grouped under a 
single head and be shown as ‘Others’. 
 
 
????? ?????????????? 
c)   Accounting Policy 
? While the Reserve Bank would prepare its financial statements 
generally in accordance with International Accounting Standards 
(IAS)/International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), it may make 
such departures as it considers appropriate. 
? Rupee Securities should be carried at fair value, and any unrealised 
gain or loss on revaluation should be transferred to the Investment 
Revaluation Account. If the balance in this account turns into debit at 
any time, the debit balance should be charged off to the Profit & Loss 
Account (Income Statement). 
? While Oil Bonds will be treated as ‘Held to Maturity’ and carried in the 
Balance Sheet at cost, all other domestic securities, other than treasury 
bills will be treated as ‘Available for Sale’ and accounted for 
accordingly. All foreign securities would also be treated as ‘Available 
for Sale’. 
? Repo and Reverse Repo transactions be accounted for as lending and 
borrowing of funds and not as sale and purchase of securities. 
The Reserve Bank would examine the report in consultation with all 
stakeholders. 
 
Background 
It may be recalled that the Reserve Bank had set up the Technical Committee 
in November 2012 (Press Release: 2012-2013 /901 dated November 29, 2012) to 
examine the form of presentation of its financial statements, the style and content of 
the management commentaries thereon and notes to the accounts of the balance 
sheet and to make recommendations to effect changes, if necessary, by appropriate 
legislative / regulatory modifications. The Committee submitted its report recently.
