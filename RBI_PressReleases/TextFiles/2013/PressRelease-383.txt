RBI releases Framework for setting up of  
Wholly Owned Subsidiaries by Foreign Banks in India 
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) today released on its website, the framework for 
setting up of Wholly Owned Subsidiaries (WOS) by foreign banks in India. The policy is 
released in pursuance of the announcement made in the Second Quarter Review of 
Monetary Policy 2013-14 (para 26). 
The policy is guided by the two cardinal principles of (i) reciprocity and (ii) single 
mode of presence. As a locally incorporated bank, the WOSs will be given near national 
treatment which will enable them to open branches anywhere in the country at par with 
Indian banks (except in certain sensitive areas where the Reserve Bank’s prior approval 
would be required). They would also be able to participate fully in the development of the 
Indian financial sector.  The policy incentivises the existing foreign bank branches which 
operate within the framework of India’s commitment to the World Trade organisation 
(WTO) to convert into WOS due to the attractiveness of near national treatment. Such 
conversion is also desirable from the financial stability perspective. To provide 
safeguards against the possibility of the Indian banking system being dominated by 
foreign banks, the framework has certain measures to contain their expansion if the 
share of foreign banks exceeds a critical size. Certain measures from corporate 
governance perspective have also been built in so as to ensure that the public interest is 
safeguarded.   
Background 
In 2004, Government of India with a view to liberalising foreign direct investments 
(FDI) in private sector banks raised the FDI limit to 74 per cent in the private sector 
banks under the automatic route and also permitted foreign banks, regulated by a 
banking supervisory authority in the home country and meeting the Reserve Bank’s 
licensing criteria to hold 100 per cent paid up capital, to set up a WOS in India. 
To operationalise the FDI guidelines, the Reserve Bank released the roadmap for 
presence of foreign banks in India in consultation with the Government of India on 
February 28, 2005.  The roadmap was divided into two phases – the first phase spanning 
the period March 2005 to March 2009 and the second phase beginning after a review of 
experience gained in the first phase.   
In the first phase, foreign banks already operating in India were allowed to convert 
their existing branches to WOS while following the ‘one-mode presence’ criterion and the 
WOS was to be treated at par with the existing branches of foreign banks for branch 
expansion in India. The second phase of the roadmap which was to commence in April 
2009 envisaged removal of limitations on the operations of WOS and treating them on 
par with the domestic banks to the extent appropriate.  During the first phase no foreign 
?nullnull???nullnullnull??2 
 
bank came forward to set up or convert their branches into WOS in the absence of 
adequate incentives. 
As a sequel to the roadmap of 2005 and pursuant to the announcements made in 
the Annual Policy Statement for 2010-11, the Reserve Bank issued a Discussion Paper 
in January 2011 on the mode of presence of foreign banks in India. The framework for 
setting up of WOS by foreign banks in India has now been finalised taking into account 
the feedback received on the Discussion Paper and factoring in the lessons from the 
crisis which favours a subsidiary mode of presence from financial stability perspective.   
Key features of the Framework 
• Banks with complex structures, banks which do not provide adequate disclosure in 
their home jurisdiction, banks which are not widely held, banks from jurisdictions 
having legislation giving a preferential claim to depositors of home country in a 
winding up proceedings, etc., would be mandated entry into India only in the WOS 
mode.  
• Foreign banks in whose case the above conditions do not apply can opt for a branch 
or WOS form of presence. 
• A foreign bank opting for branch form of presence shall convert into a WOS as and 
when the above conditions become applicable to it or it becomes systemically 
important on account of its balance sheet  size in India. 
• Foreign banks which commenced banking business in India before August 2010 
shall have the option to continue their banking business through the branch mode.  
However, they will be incentivised to convert into WOS because of the 
attractiveness of the near national treatment afforded to WOS.   
• To prevent domination by foreign banks, restrictions would be placed on further 
entry of new WOSs of foreign banks/ capital infusion, when the capital and 
reserves of the WOSs and foreign bank branches in India exceed 20 per cent of 
the capital and reserves of the banking system.  
• The initial minimum paid-up voting equity capital for a WOS shall be ` 5 billion for 
new entrants. Existing branches of foreign banks desiring to convert into WOS 
shall have a minimum net worth of ` 5 billion. 
• The parent of the WOS would be required to issue a letter of comfort to the RBI for 
meeting the liabilities of the WOS. 
• Corporate Governance – (i) not less than two-third of the directors should be non-
executive directors; (ii) a minimum of one-third of the directors should be independent 
of the management of the subsidiary in India, its parent or associates; (iii) not less 
than fifty per cent of the directors should be Indian nationals /NRIs/PIOs subject to 
rd
the condition that not less than 1/3 of the directors are Indian nationals resident in 
India.  
• The branch expansion guidelines as applicable to domestic scheduled commercial 
banks would generally be applicable to WOSs of foreign banks except that they will 
require prior approval of RBI for opening branches at certain locations that are 
sensitive from the perspective of national security.  3 
 
• Priority Sector lending requirement would be 40 per cent for WOS like domestic 
scheduled commercial banks with adequate transition period for existing foreign bank 
branches converting into WOS.  
• On arm’s length basis, WOS would be permitted to use parental guarantee/ credit 
rating only for the purpose of providing custodial services and for their international 
operations. However, WOS should not provide counter guarantee to its parent for 
such support. 
• WOSs may, at their option, dilute their stake to 74 per cent or less in accordance with 
the existing FDI policy.  In the event of dilution, they will have to list themselves. 
The issue of permitting WOS to enter into M&A transactions with any private sector bank 
in India subject to the overall investment limit of 74 per cent would be considered after a 
review is made with regard to the extent of penetration of foreign investment in Indian 
banks and functioning of foreign banks (branch mode and WOS).
