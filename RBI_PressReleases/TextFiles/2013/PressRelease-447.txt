Second Quarter Review of Monetary Policy 2013-14 
Statement by Dr. Raghuram G. Rajan, Governor, Reserve Bank of India  
"Good Morning and welcome to the Reserve Bank. 
 Today, continuing the process begun in September, we have announced the 
following policy measures: 
• we have reduced the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate by 25 basis 
points from 9.0 per cent to 8.75 per cent with immediate effect; 
• we have also increased the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment 
facility (LAF) by 25 basis points from 7.5 per cent to 7.75 per cent with 
immediate effect; and  
• the liquidity provided through term repos of 7-day and 14-day tenor has 
been increased from  0.25 per cent of net demand and time liabilities 
(NDTL) of the banking system to 0.5 per cent with immediate effect. 
Assessment 
 Our policy decisions are based on a detailed assessment of the global and 
domestic macroeconomic situation. The outlook for global growth has improved 
modestly and the prospect of delay in the taper of the Federal Reserve’s bond 
purchases has brought calm to financial markets.    
 Domestically, while industrial activity has weakened, strengthening export 
growth, signs of revival in some services along with the expected pick-up in 
agriculture could increase the real GDP growth from 4.4 per cent in Q1 to a central 
estimate of 5.0 per cent for the year as a whole. The revival of large stalled projects 
and the pipeline cleared by the Cabinet Committee on Investment may buoy 
investment and overall activity towards the close of the year. 
 On inflation, both wholesale and consumer price inflation are likely to remain 
elevated in the months ahead, warranting anappropriate policy response. 
 We have calibrated liquidity management to the system’s requirements. We are 
providing liquidity through overnight LAF repos, through export credit refinance and 
through 7-day and 14-day term repos. We have also given greater flexibility in 
managing reserve requirements. Going forward, however, the more durable strategy 
for mitigating mismatches between the supply of, and demand for, funds is for banks 
to step up efforts to mobilise deposits.

 On the external sector, a perceptible narrowing of the trade deficit coupled with 
policy interventions have brought some calm to the foreign exchange market, but 
normalcy will be restored only when the demand for dollars from public sector oil 
marketing companies is fully returned to the market.   
Policy Stance and Rationale 
 We began a calibrated change in the exceptional liquidity measures since 
September. As steps to contain the current account deficit started taking effect in an 
improving external environment and as volatility in the foreign exchange market 
ebbed, it became possible for us to unwind the exceptional liquidity tightening 
measures. With the reduction of the MSF rate and the increase in the repo rate in this 
review, the process of re-aligning the interest rate corridor to normal monetary policy 
operations is now complete.   
 However, it is important to break the spiral of rising price pressures in order to 
curb the erosion of financial saving and strengthen the foundations of growth. It is in 
this context that the LAF repo rate has been increased by 25 basis points.  Curbing 
mounting inflationary pressures and managing inflation expectations will help 
strengthen the environment for growth by fostering macroeconomic and financial 
stability. The Reserve Bank will closely monitor inflation risk while being mindful of 
the evolving growth dynamics.  
Developmental and Regulatory Policies 
 We plan to build the Reserve Bank’s developmental measures over the next 
few quarters on five pillars. These are: 
a. Clarifying and strengthening the monetary policy framework. 
b. Strengthening banking structure through new entry, branch expansion, 
encouraging new varieties of banks, and moving foreign banks into better 
regulated organizational forms. 
c. Broadening and deepening financial markets and increasing their liquidity 
and resilience so that they can help absorb the risks entailed in financing 
India’s growth. 
d. Expanding access to finance to small and medium enterprises, the 
unorganized sector, the poor, and remote and underserved areas of the 
country through measures to foster financial inclusion. 
e. Improving the system’s ability to deal with corporate distress and financial 
institution distress by strengthening real and financial restructuring as well 
as debt recovery. 
 Action on the monetary policy framework will follow the submission of the      
Dr. Urjit Patel Committee report. A number of measures to strengthen bank 
structures and financial markets have already been announced, and more will follow 
as they are worked out. The strategy to expand financial inclusion will be informed by 
the Dr. Nachiket Mor Committee report, though significant efforts to explore the use 
of technology are already under way. 
 I invite you all to go through Part B of the Policy Statement which lays out 
developmental and regulatory initiatives. I will only list a few important ones. We are 3 
 
discussing other measures and the fact that I do not mention them does not mean 
that they are not on the table, only that more work is needed to get them to the point 
where they can be announced. 
 In formulating these measures, we have listened to concerns that have been 
expressed to us. For instance, a number of banks have expressed concerns about 
the difficulty of settling  electronic funds transfers when the markets have closed. 
Keeping this in mind, we have revised the timing of MSF operations. With effect from 
November 5, 2013 they will be conducted between 7.00 pm and 7.30 pm instead of 
between 4.45 pm and 5.15 pm. I believe this new timing will help the banks greatly in 
their reserve management and help free up liquidity for the economy. Turning to 
other measures 
• The report of the Group to operationalise the countercyclical capital buffer 
framework in India (Chairman: Shri B. Mahapatra) will be placed on our 
website by end-November for comments. 
• The draft of the proposed framework for dealing with Domestic 
Systemically Important Banks in India will be placed on our website by end-
November. 
• The scheme of subsidiarisation of foreign banks in India in order to reduce 
the risks they pose to the system while giving them the near national 
treatment promised in the past will be placed on our website within two 
weeks. It will be guided by the two cardinal principles of reciprocity and 
single mode of presence. 
• Inflation Indexed National Saving Securities (IINSSs) will be launched for 
retail investors in November/December 2013.  
• Guidelines on cash settled 10-year interest rate futures contracts will be 
issued by mid-November so that the product can be launched by the 
exchanges by end-December. 
• A number of suggestions from the FSLRC report to improve the interaction 
between the RBI and its regulated entities are being implemented. 
 I thank you for your attention and on behalf of the Reserve Bank, my best 
wishes to everyone for a Happy Diwali."
