Reserve Bank Cancels the Licence of Swami Samarth Sahakari Bank Ltd., 
Akkalkot, Solapur, (Maharashtra)  
In view of the fact that Swami Samarth Sahakari Bank Ltd., Akkalkot, Solapur, 
(Maharashtra), had ceased to be solvent, all efforts to revive it in close consultation 
with the Government of Maharashtra had failed and the depositors were being 
inconvenienced by continued uncertainty, the Reserve Bank of India [RBI] delivered 
the order cancelling its licence to the bank and the same is effective from the close 
of business as on December 28, 2012. The Registrar of Co-operative Societies, 
Maharashtra has also been requested to issue an order for winding up the bank and 
appoint a liquidator for the bank.  It may be highlighted that on liquidation, every 
depositor is entitled to repayment of his/her deposits up to a monetary ceiling of 
`1,00,000/- (Rupees One lakh only) from the Deposit Insurance and Credit 
Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) under usual terms and conditions.  
The bank was granted a licence by RBI on February 13, 1988 to commence 
banking business. The statutory inspection of the bank conducted under section 35 
of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (As Applicable to Co-operative Societies) 
(hereinafter referred to as the ‘Act’), with reference to its financial position as on 
March 31, 2006 revealed that the networth and CRAR were assessed at                   
`58.16 lakh and 4.2%, respectively. The bank was, therefore, not complying with the 
regulatory capital requirement of 9%. Further, the gross and net NPAs were 
assessed at 23.4% and 18.5% of the gross and net advances, respectively. The 
bank was issued operational instructions vide RBI letter dated December 1, 2006 in 
terms of which it was, interalia, advised to restrict exposure limits for lending to 
individual and group borrowers at 5% and 10%, respectively, of its capital funds.  
The financial indicators of the bank continued to deteriorate further as 
revealed during the subsequent inspections conducted with reference to its financial 
position as on March 31, 2006, March 31, 2007, March 31, 2008, March 31, 2009 
and March 31, 2010.  
The statutory inspection of the bank under section 35 of the Act, with 
reference to the financial position as on March 31, 2011, interalia, revealed further 
deterioration in the financial position of the bank and other violations. Its net worth 
was assessed at (-) `384.89 lakh and CRAR was assessed at (-) 45.3%. The erosion 
in deposits was to the extent of 22.7%. The gross and net NPAs formed 61.0% and 
56.5% of the gross and net advances respectively. The assessed net loss of the 
bank stood at `510.77 lakh for the year ended March 31, 2011. The bank had 
defaulted in the maintenance of CRR on three occasions and SLR on four occasions 
in February 2011 and, thereafter, the SLR default continued from March 21, 2011. 
The BoD didn’t function in a cohesive manner. The enquiry conducted by RCS under 
section 83 of the MCS Act, 1960 brought out serious irregularities in the functioning 
of the bank.

assessed at (-) 49.1%. The gross and net NPAs formed 56.5% and 50.5% of the

76/12.22.282/2011-12 dated March 30, 2012 for a period of six months, subject to

29, 2013 vide directive UBD.CO.BSDI/D-9/12.22.282/2012-2013 dated September 
14, 2012. The action plan submitted by the bank vide its letter dated April 9, 2012 
was examined and not found to be satisfactory.  
Serious deficiencies as mentioned above revealed that the affairs of the bank 
were being conducted in a manner detrimental to the interests of the depositors. The 
bank did not comply with the provisions of sections 11(1), 18, 20A, 22(3) (a), 22(3) 
(b), 24, 29 and 31 of the Act. Based on the financial position of the bank as on 
December 31, 2011 the bank  was issued a Show Cause Notice (SCN) vide letter 
UBD.CO.BSD I.SCN.70/ 12.22.282/ 2011-12 dated May 15, 2012 to show cause as 
to why the licence granted to it on February 13, 1988 to carry on banking business 
under section 22 of the Act should not be cancelled and the bank be taken into 
liquidation. The bank’s reply to the SCN vide letter dated June 14, 2012, and further 
vide letters dated July 12, 2012 & July 19, 2012 were examined. As the bank 
claimed improvement in its financials, it was decided to carry out a quick scrutiny to 
verify the claims made by the bank.  
However, the scrutiny of the financial position of the bank as on             
September 30, 2012 revealed deterioration in the financial position of the bank. The 
CRAR and networth were assessed at (-)52.7% and (-) `420.49 lakh, respectively. 
The deposits erosion stood at 28.9%. The gross and net NPAs formed 63.9% and 
40.8% of the gross and net advances respectively. The bank reported accumulated 
loss amounting to  `590.62 lakh.                  
Therefore, RBI took the extreme measure of cancelling licence of the bank in 
the interest of bank's depositors. With the cancellation of licence and 
commencement of liquidation proceedings, the process of paying the depositors of 
the Swami Samarth Sahakari Bank Ltd., Akkalkot, Solapur, (Maharashtra)) the 
amount insured as per the DICGC Act, will be set in motion subject to the terms and 
conditions of the Deposit Insurance Scheme.

Ltd., Akkalkot, Solapur, (Maharashtra) is prohibited from carrying on ‘banking 
business’ as defined in section 5(b) of the Act.
