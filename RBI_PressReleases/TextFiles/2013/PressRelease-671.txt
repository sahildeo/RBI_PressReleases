RBI Working Paper Series 8 
 Macroprudential Regulation and Bank Performance: Evidence from India 
The Reserve Bank today placed on its website a Working Paper titled 
“Macroprudential Regulation and  Bank Performance: Evidence from India”. The 
paper has been authored by Dr. Saibal Ghosh. 
In recent times, a lot of emphasis has been placed on financial sector reforms 
as a means to improve the overall functioning of the sector. As it well-acknowledged, 
such reforms have encompassed a significant gamut of measures, including lowering 
of statutory reserve requirements, deregulation of interest rates, introduction of 
measures relating to income recognition, loan classification and provisioning, 
allowing more liberal entry of foreign banks and diversifying the ownership base of 
state-owned banks. The evidence emanating from empirical research is admittedly 
mixed. The existing literature tends to look at each macroprudential measure in 
isolation, thereby ignoring the effect of these measures in totality on bank 
performance.  
In this context, the paper investigates how various measures of 
macroprudential regulation affect the performance of the banking sector. More 
specifically, employing bank-level data across various ownership categories for the 
period 1992-2012, the paper considers the impact of three major dimensions of 
macroprudential regulation – capital adequacy ratio, provisioning norms and loan 
classification requirements – on the performance of the Indian banking sector. To 
assess the impact, the author employs four indicators: return on asset (RoA) as the 
profitability measure, net interest margin (NIM) as the measure of economic 
efficiency, Z-score as the measure of bank stability and finally, advances growth 
(Gr_Advances) as a measure of bank business.  
The major findings of the paper can be summarised as follows: 
• Banks with greater retail dependence have higher profitability and margins. 
In the baseline specification, a 10 per cent increase in retail dependence 
improves RoA by nearly 0.3 percentage points. One reason for this could be 
the low (or negligible) cost of such deposits, which enables banks to earn 
higher margins and profitability on such funds.  
• Bigger banks appear to exhibit greater stability. As well, credit growth is 
slower for big banks, suggestive of the fact that smaller banks increase 
credit at a faster pace to gain market share.

• When we include bank ownership, it is observed that as compared to 
domestic private banks, foreign banks have lower credit growth and 
stability. The effect is quantitatively important, indicating that the average 
foreign bank has a credit growth that is 0.08 percentage points lower as 
compared to an average domestic private bank. 
• Next, the analysis examines whether such differentials between state-
owned and private banks are driven by macroprudential measures; it finds 
strong support for this hypothesis.  
The Reserve Bank of India introduced the RBI Working Papers series in 
March 2011. These papers present research in progress of the staff members of the 
Reserve Bank and are disseminated to elicit comments and further debate. The 
views expressed in these papers are those of authors and not those of the Reserve 
Bank of India. Comments and observations may kindly be forwarded to authors. 
Citation and use of such papers should take into account its provisional character.
