Personal Hearing for Compounding under FEMA: RBI Clarification 
The Reserve Bank of India today clarified that appearing for a personal hearing 
before the compounding authority is optional and the applicant can choose not to 
appear for it. The applicant may enclose full information relating to the case as 
prescribed in AP (Dir series) Circular Nos. 56 and 57 dated June 28, 2010 and 
December 13, 2011, respectively, with the application or thereafter and may exercise 
his discretion with regard to appearing for hearing.  
The Reserve Bank also clarified that if the applicant opts for appearing for the 
personal hearing, the Reserve Bank would encourage the applicant to appear directly 
for it rather than being represented / accompanied by legal experts / consultants, as 
compounding is only for admitted contraventions. The Reserve Bank further stated 
that appearing for or opting out of personal hearing does not have any bearing 
whatsoever on the amount of penalty involved in the compounding order. 
Rule  8(2) of Foreign Exchange (Compounding Proceedings) Rules, 2000 
states that the compounding authority shall pass an order of compounding after 
affording an opportunity of being heard to all the concerned as expeditiously as 
possible and not later than 180 days from the date of application. Many applicants 
interpret this provision / facility to mean that personal hearing is compulsory and that 
consultants / advocates must represent them in the personal hearing before the 
compounding authority.
