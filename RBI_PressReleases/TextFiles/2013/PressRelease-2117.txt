Finances of Non-Government Non-Financial   
Large Public Limited Companies, 2011-12 
  The Reserve Bank of India today released on its website the data related to 
Finances of Non-Government Non-Financial (NGNF) Large Public Limited 
Companies, 2011-12. The data have been compiled based on audited annual 
accounts of 1,843 large (each with paid-up capital of    `10 million and above) NGNF 
public limited companies. It draws a comparative picture over the three year period 
2009-10 to 2011-12. ‘Explanatory notes’ to the statements are given separately in 
Annexure. 
Main Findings 
? Sales growth moderated during 2011-12. As operating expenses continued to 
grow at a rate higher than that of sales, Earnings Before Interest, Tax, 
Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA) and net profit (PAT) declined. 
Consequently, gross saving by the select companies also declined in 2011-12. 
Profit margin of the select companies was also lower in 2011-12 than in 2010-
11. 
? Sales size-wise disaggregated position showed that in case of the smaller 
companies with sales ‘below `250 million’ and ‘`500 million - `1 billion’, sales 
declined in 2011-12 compared with that in 2010-11. The EBITDA margin fell 
across all sales-size groups in 2011-12. The companies with sales ‘below `250 
million’ continued to make operating losses.  
? The moderation in growth of sales was steeper in the services sector than in 
the manufacturing sector, but the margin declined by a smaller amount in the 
former case. Companies in the ‘Transportation’ and ‘Real Estate’ industries 
performed poorly, both in terms of sales and EBITDA. On the other hand, 
companies belonging to ‘Chemical and Chemical Products’, ‘Cement and 
Cement Products’, ‘Iron and Steel’, ‘Construction’, ‘Computer and related 
activities’ industries recorded higher growth in sales in 2011-12. Also, 
companies in the ‘Cement and Cement Products’ industry recorded a high 
growth in EBITDA in 2011-12 contrary to the general trend. 
? Growth rate in total borrowing in 2011-12 was at the same level as that in 
2010-11. Largest sales size companies with sales ‘above `10 billion’ recorded 
the highest growth in borrowing while the smallest ones with sales ‘below `250 
million’ borrowed less in 2011-12. Companies in ‘Food Products and 
Beverages’ industry continued to borrow significantly, recording high growth in 
2011-12 like in 2010-11. Besides, high growth in borrowing in 2011-12 was 
observed in ‘Machineries and equipments (non-electrical)’, ‘Construction’, 
‘Chemical and Chemical Products’ industries.

? Total net assets, at aggregate level, have also grown at lower rate in 2011-12 
compared with that in 2010-11. Similar trend is observed across most of the 
sales size groups and in most of the industries.  
? Debt to equity ratio (debt as percentage of net worth) increased in 2011-12 as 
compared with 2010-11. However, it  declined for companies in sales size 
group `5 billion - `10 billion and also in ‘Food Products and Beverages’, 
‘Pharmaceuticals’, ‘Electrical Machineries’, ‘Motor vehicles and other transport 
equipments’ and ‘Computer and related activities’ industries. Debt to equity 
ratio continued to be high in ‘Transportation’, ‘Textiles’ and ‘Iron and Steel’ 
industries.  
? Around 60.8 per cent of incremental funds during 2011-12 for the select 
companies came from external sources (other than companies’ own sources). 
Share of borrowing in total sources of funds increased while that of fresh issue 
of capital declined.  
? As compared to 2010-11, significantly higher share of funds raised during 
2011-12 was used for acquiring plant and machineries. Similarly, funds used 
for financial investment during the year were higher than the previous year. 
      An article analysing the performance of NGNF large public limited companies 
at the aggregate level as well as based on sales, size, and industry for a longer 
period is being published in the March 2013 issue of RBI Bulletin.
