Quarterly Order Books, Inventories and Capacity Utilisation Survey 
January-March 2013 (Round 21) 
st
The Reserve Bank of India has launched the 21 round of its Order Books, 
Inventories and Capacity Utilisation Survey (OBICUS). The survey is for the 
reference period January-March 2013.  
The Reserve Bank has been conducting Order Books, Inventories and 
Capacity Utilisation Survey (OBICUS) of the manufacturing sector on a quarterly 
basis. The survey seeks quantitative information on order books, inventories and 
capacity utilisation, such as, pending order books, backlog order books, total 
inventories, finished goods inventories, work in progress inventories, installed 
capacity, quantity produced, capacity utilisation, value of production, etc. from 
companies involved in manufacturing activities. The information on installed 
capacity, quantity produced, value of production, etc. are used for calculating the 
capacity utilisation at industry as well as at an all India level. The survey has been 
providing a significant input to the Reserve Bank in monetary policy formulation.  
 The salient features of this survey results at the aggregate level are published 
in Macroeconomic and Monetary Developments (MMD) with data release in every 
quarter. A detailed article based on the results for the quarter ending October 2011 
to September 2012 was published in March 2013 issue of the RBI monthly Bulletin. 
 M/s Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy Private Ltd. (CMIE), Mumbai, has 
been mandated to conduct the survey for this quarter on behalf of the Reserve Bank 
of India. The major manufacturing companies will be approached by the agency 
during the quarter. Other manufacturing companies that are not approached by the 
agency can also participate in this survey round by downloading the survey 
schedule from the Reserve Bank’s website www.rbi.org.in. The survey schedule is
