Basic Statistical Returns of  
Scheduled Commercial Banks in India - Volume 41, March 2012 
 
The Reserve Bank of India today placed on its website Basic Statistical Returns of  
Scheduled Commercial Banks in India - Volume 41.   
 
                       “Basic Statistical Returns of Scheduled Commercial Banks in India”, provides granular 
data on different dimensions of deposits and credit of the banking sector. The information is 
collected from bank branches through Basic Statistical Returns 1 & 2 (BSR 1&2), annually. 
Under BSR 1, account level data for loan accounts with credit limit more than `200,000 and 
occupation-wise consolidated data for loan accounts with credit limit up to  `200,000 (small 
borrowal accounts) are collected branch-wise. The parameters for account level information 
are occupation/activity and organisational sector of the borrower, type of account, interest 
rate, credit limit and amount outstanding. Under BSR 2, branch-wise data on type of 
deposits, maturity pattern of term deposits as well as number of employees are collected.  
 
         Such information is aggregated at population group, bank group and state level in this 
publication. A unique feature of this publication is that it covers spatial distribution of credit in 
st
terms of place of sanction and place of utilisation. The present volume, 41 in the series, 
st
provides data of scheduled commercial banks as on 31 March 2012. A set of important 
tables are now being released in Bank’s website. The hardcopy of the publication along with 
the CD version containing more detailed information will be released in due course.
