IMF-World Bank: India - Basel Core Principles for Effective Banking 
Supervision - Detailed Assessment Report  
 RBI welcomes the comprehensive review of banking regulation and 
supervision in India done with respect to the highest international standards, by the 
joint IMF-World Bank team. The Detailed Assessment Report (DAR) recognised that 
India made considerable progress towards developing a stable financial system 
through improvements in the legal, regulatory and supervisory framework, which led 
India to be less affected by the global financial crisis. It added that Indian financial 
system’s vulnerabilities appeared manageable. 
 The assessment, however, identifies several gaps and constraints in the 
implementation of regulatory and supervisory framework. These include international 
and, to a lesser extent, domestic supervisory information sharing and cooperation, 
consolidated supervision of financial conglomerates, higher large exposure limits for 
group borrowers and some limits on the independence of the Reserve Bank.   
 Since the assessment, Reserve Bank has made significant progress regarding 
supervisory information sharing and cooperation with jurisdictions where Indian 
banks are operating. Reserve Bank has entered into Memorandums of 
Understanding (MoUs) on “Supervisory Co-operation and Exchange of Information” 
with 16 overseas jurisdictions where Indian banks have significant presence. 
Correspondence is in progress with another 28 jurisdictions to finalise mutually 
agreeable MoUs. Inspection of Indian banks in five overseas jurisdictions covering 
almost 60 per cent of the total overseas assets of Indian banks was undertaken last 
year. Inspection of Indian banks in six other overseas jurisdictions covering another 
20 per cent of the total overseas assets of Indian banks is currently in progress. The 
Reserve Bank had also hosted supervisory colleges for State Bank of India and ICICI 
Bank Limited. Proposals are also under consideration to set up supervisory colleges 
for two more globally active Indian banks. The Financial Stability and Development 
Council (FSDC), under the chairmanship of the Finance Minister, serves as the apex 
forum for effective regulatory coordination. A Sub-Committee of the FSDC, under the 
chairmanship of the Reserve Bank Governor, provides the next layer of co-ordination 
on a more frequent basis. To streamline and further strengthen the statutory 
framework and address regulatory overlaps, the Financial Sector Legislative Reforms 
Commission (FSLRC) has made recommendations that are under the consideration 
of the Government of India. 
 There has also been significant progress regarding supervision of financial 
conglomerates and monitoring of corporate indebtedness with the amendment of 
Section 29A of Banking Regulation Act in December 2012. With this amendment, the 
Reserve Bank is now empowered to effect an inspection of any associate enterprise 
of a banking company jointly by one or more officers of the Reserve Bank along with 
????? ??????????????2 
 
the respective regulatory authority. Efforts are also underway to strengthen 
consolidated supervision of identified financial conglomerates under the aegis of the 
Inter-Regulatory Forum (IRF), as a sub-group of the FSDC Sub-Committee. To 
enable the IRF to have an institutional mechanism for periodic co-ordination on 
supervisory related issues and enable the lead regulators to effectively discharge 
their duties towards consolidated supervision of identified financial conglomerates, an 
MoU for facilitating data/information sharing and formalising other co-operation 
arrangements like coordinated inspection, recovery and resolution planning, etc., has 
been signed by Reserve Bank of India (RBI), Securities and Exchange Board of India 
(SEBI), Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) and Pension Fund 
Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) under the aegis of the Sub-
Committee of the FSDC.  
 The Reserve Bank is aware that the group borrower limit in India is higher than 
international norms. This deviation is on account of the development needs of the 
country. Some of the major corporate groups are key drivers of growth, and keeping 
the group borrower limit at levels comparable to the international practice would 
constrain the bank finance and hamper growth. Further, once the Basel Committee 
on Banking Supervision (BCBS) releases the report of Large Exposure Group (LEG), 
which will set the standards and harmonise the current varying practices in countries, 
a medium-term action plan for aligning the large exposure norms with international 
best practices as suitable to Indian conditions will be explored.   
 Regarding the moral hazard posed by the presence of Reserve Bank’s 
nominee director on the banks’ board, the matter has been taken up with 
Government of India for amendment of the enabling legal provision. As regards 
Reserve Bank’s autonomy from Government, it is felt that it has de facto autonomy, 
even as it does not have de jure independence.  
 In India, banking regulations are completely ownership neutral and the same 
level of scrutiny is applied to all banks. Foreign banks have the same amount of 
freedom as domestic banks (except regarding expansion) and are treated at par with 
domestic banks for prudential purposes. Reserve Bank does not consult the 
government while imposing penalty on public sector banks, and places it in public 
domain as it does for other banks. 
 Finally, the Reserve Bank recognises the importance of FSAP in promoting 
financial stability, even as it may differ on some aspects. Reserve Bank is committed 
to meet the best international practices that are appropriate for India. Reserve Bank 
wishes to express its support for the role FSAP would play in future in promoting the 
soundness of global financial system and looks forward to a continuing dialogue with 
the IMF/World Bank and other global counterparts in seeking to improve the stability 
and effective supervision of the global financial system. 
Background 
In 2011-2012, a Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) for India was 
conducted by a joint IMF-World Bank team and the report prepared in the context of 
that assessment was published in January 2013. IMF has released the Detailed 
Assessment Report (DAR) on Basel Core Principles for Effective Banking 
Supervision today.
