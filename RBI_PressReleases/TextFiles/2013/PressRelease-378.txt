Photographs
The Reserve Bank of India, on November 1, 2013, signed a Memorandum of 
Understanding (MoU) on “Supervisory Cooperation and Exchange of Supervisory 
Information” with Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA). Later on 
November 4, 2013, it also signed a similar Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) 
with Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ). With this, the Reserve Bank has signed 
such MoUs with 18 supervisors.  
 The MoU with APRA was signed by Mr. John Laker, Chairman, APRA and   
Dr. K. C. Chakrabarty, Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India. The function was 
held at APRA Head Quarters in Sydney, Australia. Shri Arun Kumar Goel, Consul 
General, Indian High Commission in Australia, graced the occasion. The MoU with 
Reserve Bank of New Zealand was signed by Mr. Grant Spencer, Governor, RBNZ 
and by Dr. K. C. Chakrabarty, Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India. The function 
was held at RBNZ Head Quarters in Wellington, New Zealand. Shri Mukesh Randev, 
First Secretary, Indian High Commission in New Zealand, graced the occasion. 
The MoUs provide a formal, yet legally non-binding, channel for information 
exchange between the supervisors.  The MoU provides for sharing of information on 
health of the supervised entities, cooperation between the supervisors during on-site 
examinations, frequent meetings between the supervisors and preserving the 
confidentiality of information shared. Thus MoU is not an event but a process for 
strengthening co-operation between the two supervisors. This is done through pre-
identified contact points as mentioned in the MoU which makes it easier for either 
supervisor to get in touch with their counterpart in a far easier manner.  The MoU 
does not override the laws of the land of either supervisor but only tries to build an 
environment of supervisory cooperation and coordination in complete adherence to 
such laws.  The MoU is not just a document but a mechanism that aims to augment 
the supervisory strength of both supervisors in overseeing the supervised entities and 
address concerns, if any, in a timely manner.
