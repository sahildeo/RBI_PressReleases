Financial Sector Regulators sign an MoU to monitor Financial Conglomerates; 
Approve National Strategy for Financial Education at FSDC Meeting held Today 
The financial sector regulators (Reserve Bank of India, Securities and 
Exchange Board of India, Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority and 
Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority) signed a Memorandum of 
Understanding (MoU) for co-operation in the field of consolidated supervision and 
monitoring of financial groups identified as financial conglomerates. The Sub 
Committee of the Financial Stability and Development Council (FSDC) also approved 
the National Strategy for Financial Education (NSFE). The NSFE has been revised 
incorporating the feedback received from public consultations and from a global peer 
review.  
These were the two major achievements of the meeting of the Sub Committee 
of the Financial Stability and Development Council (FSDC) held today in New Delhi. 
Dr. D. Subbarao, Governor, Reserve Bank of India, chaired the meeting. The meeting 
was attended by Shri R S Gujral, Finance Secretary; Dr. Arvind Mayaram, Secretary, 
Department of Economic Affairs (DEA); Shri Rajiv Takru, Secretary, Department of 
Financial Services (DFS); Dr. Raghuram G Rajan, Chief Economic Adviser; Shri U. 
K. Sinha, Chairman, Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI); Shri T. S. 
Vijayan, Chairman, Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA); Shri 
Yogesh Agarwal, Chairman, Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority 
(PFRDA); Deputy Governors of RBI, Dr. K.C. Chakrabarty, Shri Anand Sinha, Shri H. 
R. Khan and Dr. Urjit Patel, Executive Director of RBI, Shri G. Gopalakrishna, and 
other officials.  
The Sub-Committee also discussed the continuing uncertainty in the Eurozone 
and the US. Their impact on capital flows to India and other Emerging Market 
Economies (EMEs) also featured in the discussions. The potential risks to stability of 
the domestic financial system on account of slowing domestic growth, rising current 
account deficit and concerns on asset quality of banks were reviewed. The Sub-
Committee took stock of the country’s position vis-à-vis the global reforms agenda 
spearheaded by G20/Financial Stability Board (FSB) and emphasised the need for 
concerted efforts from all agencies concerned towards implementation of the reform 
measures.
