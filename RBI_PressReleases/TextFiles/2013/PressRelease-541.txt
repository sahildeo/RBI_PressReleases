Reserve Bank Cancels the Licence of  Shri Siddhi Vinayak Nagari  
Sahakari Bank Ltd.,Rasayani, Raigad Dist., (Maharashtra)   
 
In view of the fact that Shri Siddhi Vinayak Nagari Sahakari Bank Ltd., Rasayani, 
Raigad Dist., (Maharashtra) had ceased to be solvent, all efforts to revive it in close 
consultation with the Government of Maharashtra had failed and the depositors were being 
inconvenienced by continued uncertainty, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) delivered the 
order cancelling its licence to the bank and the same is effective from the close of business 
as on September 25, 2013. The Registrar of Co-operative Societies, Maharashtra has also 
been requested to issue an order for winding up the bank and appoint a liquidator for the 
bank. It may be highlighted that on liquidation, every depositor is entitled to repayment of 
his/her deposits up to a monetary ceiling of `1,00,000/- (Rupees One lakh only) from the 
Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) under usual terms and 
conditions.  
The bank was granted a licence by RBI on January 7, 1995 to commence banking 
business. The major financial indicators of the bank with reference to its financial position as 
on March 31, 2010, March 31, 2011 and March 31, 2012 are detailed in Annex.  
The Statutory Inspection of the bank conducted by RBI under Section 35 of the BR 
Act, 1949 (AACS) with reference to its financial position as on March 31, 2010 revealed that 
the gross and net NPAs stood high at 15.2% & 8.8%, respectively. Based on the financial 
position as on March 31, 2010, operational instructions were issued to the bank vide RBI’s 
letter dated June 8, 2011. 
The inspection of the bank as on March 31, 2011 was prioritized on account of run on 
the deposits of the bank. In the absence of required liquidity and to prevent any preferential 
payment, all-inclusive directions were imposed on the bank from the close of business as on 
September 29, 2011. The validity of directions was extended from time to time. It was, 
interalia, observed during the above inspection that (i) assessed networth stood at  (-) 
`235.59 lakh, (ii) assessed CRAR stood at (-) 9.5%, (iii) deposits had eroded to the extent of 
6.9%, (iv) quality of management was not satisfactory, (v) there were large scale accounting 
manipulations by passing of fraudulent entries from October 18, 2010 to February 25, 2011 
by way of fresh fictitious deposits in six dormant savings bank  accounts  and four  term  
deposit accounts, (vi) some loan accounts were also closed by crediting amounts 
aggregating `312.35 lakh in July 2010 through contra debit of Branch Adjustment account, 
(vii) the bank had granted loans to the father-in-law and the sister-in-law of the ex-Vice 
Chairperson without any security, (viii) the bank had defaulted in maintenance of CRR / SLR 
during the period October 01, 2010 to March 31, 2011, (ix) the bank violated Single Borrower 
norms, (x) the bank violated directive on unsecured loans, (xi) the quality of credit appraisal 
and post disbursement credit supervision was not satisfactory and (xii) the bank had not 
adhered to IRAC norms.  A monetary penalty of `1.00 lakh was imposed on the bank for 
violation of RBI directives (as pointed out in inspection report as on March 31, 2011) vide 
Speaking Order dated November 6, 2012. The bank had not paid the penalty till date.

Based on the findings of the above inspection, the Board of the bank was 
superseded by Registrar of Co-operative Societies, Maharashtra on May 05, 2012 on the 
requisition issued by RBI and the bank was under an Administrator since May 08, 2012. 
The statutory inspection of the bank with reference to its financial position as on 
March 31, 2012 revealed severe deterioration of its financial position. The assessed 
networth stood at (-) `738.97 lakh, assessed CRAR stood at (-) 25.5% and deposits had 
eroded to the extent of 23.5%. The inspection also, interalia, revealed that (i) the bank had 
defaulted in maintenance of SLR from October 2010 to May 31, 2012 and CRR from 
October 10, 2010 to September 09, 2012, (ii) the investment in SLR securities at 17.2% was 
below the requirement of 25.0% of the applicable NDTL, (iii) the bank had not made 
provisions for interest liability on matured deposits, (iv) the bank had created floating charge 
on its assets without obtaining approval from RBI thereby violating section 14A of the 
B.R.Act, 1949 (AACS), (v) the bank had made certain fraudulent entries aggregating 
`923.45 lakh, (vi) the bank’s exposure to unsecured advances including the fraudulent 
entries amounting to `923.45 lakh stood at 21.3% of total assets of previous year thereby 
breaching the limit of 10.0%, (vii) the bank had not adhered to IRAC norms, (viii) there was 
wide divergence in classification of NPAs, (ix) NPA management of the bank was not 
satisfactory as there was a huge slippage of `1519.04 lakh against recovery of `352.72 lakh 
and (x) the bank had one fraud case outstanding in its books amounting to `1141.61 lakh as 
its Panvel branch but the bank had not initiated any legal action against the employee who 
committed the above fraud.  
 Penal interest amounting to `21,97,768/- was imposed on the bank for non-
maintenance of CRR/ SLR from November 2010 to September 2011. The bank had not paid 
the penal interest till the date of cancellation of licence. 
Based on the financial position of the bank as on March 31, 2012 the bank was 
issued a Show Cause Notice (SCN) vide letter dated June 5, 2013 to show cause as to why 
the licence granted to it on January 7, 1995 to  carry  on  banking  business  under  section  
22  of the  BR  Act, 1949 (AACS)  should  not be cancelled and the bank be taken into 
liquidation. The bank’s reply to the SCN vide letter dated July 2, 2013 was examined and not 
found to be satisfactory. The bank had also informed that the Administrators are exploring 
merger possibilities with two banks. However, no concrete merger proposal had been 
received from any bank till date. 
From the above, it is conclusively established that 
 
i. The bank is not in a position to pay its present and future depositors; 
 
ii. The affairs of the bank were and are being conducted in a manner detrimental  
to the interests of the depositors; 
iii. The bank does not comply with section 11(1), 22(3)(a) and 22(3)(b) of the BR Act, 
1949 (AACS); 
iv. The financial position of the bank leaves little scope for its revival and 
 
v. In all likelihood, public interest would be adversely affected if the bank were allowed 
to carry on its business any further. 
Therefore, RBI took the extreme measure of cancelling the licence of the bank in the 
interest of bank's depositors. With the cancellation of licence and commencement of 
liquidation proceedings, the process of paying the depositors of Shri Siddhi Vinayak Nagari 
Sahakari Bank Ltd., Rasayani, Raigad Dist., (Maharashtra), the amount insured as per the 
DICGC Act, 1961 will be set in motion subject to the terms and conditions of the Deposit 
Insurance Scheme.
