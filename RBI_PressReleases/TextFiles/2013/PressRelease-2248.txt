RBI releases Financial Literacy Material 
  
Financial Literacy creates demand for financial products & services, thereby 
accelerating the pace of financial inclusion as it enables the common man to understand the 
needs and benefits of the products and services offered by the banks. Towards this 
objective, RBI had issued revised guidelines on the Financial literacy Centres (FLC) on   
June 6, 2012, advising banks that FLCs and all the rural branches of  scheduled commercial 
banks  should scale up financial literacy efforts through conduct of outdoor Financial Literacy 
Camps, at least once a month, to facilitate financial inclusion through provision of two 
essentials i.e. ‘Financial Literacy’ and easy ‘Financial Access’. 
 
As advised therein, we have now prepared a comprehensive Financial Literacy 
Guide containing Guidance Note for Trainers, Operational Guidelines for conduct of 
Financial Literacy Camps & Financial Literacy Material as also a Financial Diary and a set of 
16 posters. The Financial Literacy Guide contains operational guidelines which clearly spell 
out the manner in which Financial Literacy Camps should be conducted so as to  
synchronise it with providing financial access and thus linking the financially excluded 
section with the banking system. The objective of Financial Literacy material is to aid 
creating financial awareness and educate common people on management of money, 
importance of savings, advantages of saving with banks, other facilities provided by banks 
and benefits of borrowing from banks.  This guide is a ready reckoner for trainers involved in 
Financial Literacy and Financial Inclusion. The Financial Diary has been prepared for 
distribution to the target audience with the objective of enabling them to keep a record of 
their income and expenses leading to better financial planning and understanding of how 
they spend. The posters with simple and appealing slogans, which communicate the 
messages of money management, savings, borrowings and basic banking products 
pictorially, may be displayed prominently before, during and after the Financial Literacy 
Camps.  
 
To start with, the entire material has been prepared in Hindi and English. It will also 
be translated in other Indian languages in due course of time.  It is time for banks to conduct 
Financial Literacy Camps in a mission mode, with the ultimate objective of making financial 
inclusion a viable business model by capturing the untapped business opportunities. In order 
to ensure consistency in the messages reaching the target audience of financially excluded 
people during the Financial Literacy Camps, we have advised banks to use the Financial 
Literacy Guide as a standard curriculum to impart basic conceptual understanding of 
financial products and services. For any further details, we may be contacted by email.
