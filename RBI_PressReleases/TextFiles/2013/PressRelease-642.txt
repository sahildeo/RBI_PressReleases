increase of US$ 0.5 billion during April-June 2012. The foreign exchange reserves in

The valuation loss, reflecting the appreciation of the US dollar against major 
currencies and fall in international gold prices, amounted to US$ 9.2 billion during 
April-June 2013 as compared to a loss of US$ 5.2 billion during the same period of 
preceding year.
