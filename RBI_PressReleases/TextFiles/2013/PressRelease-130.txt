2. Strengthening banking structure through new entry, branch expansion, 
encouraging new varieties of banks, and moving foreign banks into better 
regulated organisational forms; 
3. Broadening and deepening financial markets and increasing their liquidity and 
resilience so that they can help allocate and absorb the risks entailed in financing 
India ’s growth; 
4. Expanding access to finance for small and medium enterprises, the unorganised 
sector, the poor, and remote and underserved areas; 
5.  Improving the system ’s ability to deal with corporate distress and financial
