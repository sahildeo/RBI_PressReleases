A similar scrutiny was also conducted in seven other banks during April and 
May 2013. The process of follow up action in respect of those banks is at different 
stages of its completion.  
The penalties have been imposed in exercise of powers vested in the Reserve 
Bank under the provisions of Section 47(A)(1)( c ) read with Section 46(4)(i) of the 
Banking Regulation Act, 1949.  
Background 
It may be recalled that the Reserve Bank of India had carried out a scrutiny of 
books of accounts, internal control, compliance systems and processes of these 
banks at their offices during April 2013. The scrutiny of these banks revealed 
violation of certain regulations and instructions issued by the Reserve Bank of India, 
namely, 
• non-adherence to certain aspects of know your customer (KYC) norms and 
anti money laundering (AML) guidelines like customer identification procedure, 
risk categorisation, periodical review of risk profiling of account holders, 
periodical KYC updation;  
• non-adherence of KYC for walk in customers including for sale of third party 
products, omission in filing of cash transaction reports (CTRs) in respect of 
some cash transactions, sale of gold coins for cash beyond  50,000; 
• non-adherence to instructions on monitoring of transactions in customer 
accounts; 
• non-adherence to instructions on classification of accounts as ‘in-
operative’/dormant and lapses in monitoring of transactions in dormant 
accounts; 
• non-adherence to instructions which prohibits acceptance of cash above 
50,000 from customers for sale of gold coins and issue of Demand Drafts, 
etc.; 
• non-adherence to instructions on the upper limit for remittances under 
Liberalised Remittance Scheme, upper limit for repatriation of funds from non 
resident ordinary (NRO) accounts; 
• non-adherence to instructions on import of gold on consignment basis.

The investigation did not reveal any prima facie evidence of money laundering. 
However, any conclusive inference in this regard can be drawn only by an end to end 
investigation of the transactions by tax and enforcement agencies.  
Based on the findings of the scrutiny, the Reserve Bank issued a show cause 
notice to each of these banks, in response to which the individual banks submitted 
written replies. After considering the facts of each case and individual bank’s reply, 
as also, personal submissions, information submitted and documents furnished, the 
Reserve Bank came to the conclusion that some of the violations were substantiated 
and warranted imposition of monetary penalty. The Reserve Bank penalised the first 
lot of three banks, on June 10, 2013.
