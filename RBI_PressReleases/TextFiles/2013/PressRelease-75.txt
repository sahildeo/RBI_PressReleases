Performance of the Private Corporate Business Sector  
during Second Quarter of 2013-14 – Data Release 
The Reserve Bank of India today released, on its website, the data on the 
performance of non-financial private corporate business sector during second quarter of 
2013-14 (July-September 2013). 
The data compiled are based on the abridged financial results of 2,708 listed non-
government non-financial (NGNF) companies. To enable comparison, similar data 
pertaining to Q1:2013-14 and Q2:2012-13 are also presented. Coverage of companies in 
different quarters varies to some extent, depending on date of declaration of quarterly 
results but it is not expected to alter the aggregate position significantly. ‘Explanatory 
Notes’ containing the brief methodology followed for compilation of data and the glossary 
of terms is given at the end. 
Highlights: 
• Sales growth (Y-o-Y) improved in Q2:2013-14 after successive deceleration since 
Q3:2011-12. This improvement was due to the large (annualised sales above         
`10 billion) companies.  
• Sales of small (annualised sales below `1 billion) companies, however, continued to 
contract. 
• The upturn in sales growth is noticeable for the manufacturing and the IT sectors, 
while slowdown continued in the non-IT services sector. 
• Among the major industries, sales growth was high in textiles, coke & refined 
petroleum products, chemicals and chemical product industries. However, cement& 
cement products, iron & steel, motor vehicle & transport equipments and machinery 
industries continued to record contraction in sales.  
• The improvement in sales growth was not reflected in profit growth (Earnings before 
Interest, Tax, Depreciation & Amortisation (EBITDA) and Net Profit growth) and profit 
margins.  
• Pricing power, as measured by profit margins remained low since Q2:2011-12 and 
eroded further in Q2:2013-14. As compared to the previous quarter, EBITDA margin 
declined at the aggregate level and also for the manufacturing and the non-IT 
services sectors. Net profit margin remained almost unchanged at the aggregate 
level. However, it declined for manufacturing sector. Both the margins improved for 
the IT sector.  
• Interest expenses grew at a higher rate in Q2:2013-14 across all sectors. Interest 
coverage ratio (Earnings before Interest & Tax (EBIT)/Interest expenses) was 
distinctly lower than that observed in Q2:2012-13; however, the ratio remained almost 
similar to that in Q1:2013-14.
