RBI holds Annual Statistics Conference 2013
The Annual Statistics Conference 2013 of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)
was organised by the Department of Statistics and Information Management during
March 22-23, 2013 in Mumbai. The conference provided a platform to the
statisticians of the Reserve Bank to present their research before external experts
and receive their feedback in order to make the analysis more meaningful for policy
and research.
Dr. Urjit R. Patel, Deputy Governor inaugurated the conference. Shri Deepak
Mohanty, Executive Director; heads of select central office departments of the
Reserve Bank; renowned statisticians and economists from the academia; and the
statisticians of the Reserve Bank participated in the conference.
The conference highlighted some broad features of statistical activity in the
Reserve Bank. Three important and key takeaways were:
· The use of statistical tools for modelling and forecasting macroeconomic
variables of critical importance to the Reserve Bank needs to be constantly
improved.
· The initiatives to externally validate statistical research, surveys and other
statistical activities are useful and should be continued.
· Focussed approach to research across various central office departments and
the regional offices should be pursued to accomplish the research agenda of
the department encompassing both policy and operational areas in a timely
manner.
Building on the initiatives of the department in managing statistical databases,
providing research inputs, undertaking forward looking surveys and data
dissemination, some areas for further work were identified. These included, among
other things, taking forward G-20 data gaps initiatives, developing a full-fledged
forecasting suite including Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) models,
undertaking surveys on financial inclusion and bringing out a revised edition of the
Manual on Banking and Financial Statistics.
The technical sessions of the conference deliberated upon, among other
things, analytical issues in modelling and forecasting, external sector developments,
banking and corporate sector, surveys and economic measurements. The
conference also deliberated upon issues in strengthening micro-level, granular and
consistent statistical information system on banking statistics to enhance its use for
policy.
