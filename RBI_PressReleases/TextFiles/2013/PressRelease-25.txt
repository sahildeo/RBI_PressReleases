RBI releases Financial Stability Report – December 2013 
The Reserve Bank of India today released the Financial Stability Report (FSR) 
– December 2013.  The eighth in the series, the FSR – December 2013 is being 
released against the backdrop of a mild positive market reaction to the 
announcement of tapering in the US Federal Reserves’ bond purchase programme 
from January 2014. The commencement of the taper should signal a calibrated return 
to normal liquidity and credit conditions in the global markets and also better pricing 
of risk. This will mean a repricing of certain assets with consequent volatility. Efforts 
during the past few months have been directed to make the Indian economy more 
resilient to the ultimate withdrawal of liquidity from the system and less reliant on 
unstable external capital for growth. 
The FSR, published every six months, aims to create awareness about the 
vulnerabilities in the financial system, to inform about the resilience to stress of the 
financial institutions and to generally serve as a health check on the financial system. 
The Report reflects the collective assessment of the Sub-Committee of the 
Financial Stability and Development Council (FSDC) on risks to financial stability. 
Highlights: 
? The US Federal Reserve has now laid to rest the uncertainty on timing of the 
exit and tapering in its bond purchase programme, which is set to begin from 
January 2014. However, financial market volatility will be conditioned by the 
pace of tapering going forward. 
(Paras 1.1  – 1.2, Chapter I) 
? Realignment of global growth as well as high inflation differential between 
advanced economies (AEs) and Emerging Markets and Developing 
Economies (EMDEs) is a potential source of exchange rate volatility and may 
result in volatile cross-border flows with every repricing of risk.  
(Paras 1.4  – 1.5, Chapter I) 
? The delay in tapering allowed India to bring about adjustment in the current 
account deficit (CAD) and build buffers by replenishing its foreign exchange 
reserves. However, macro-economic adjustment is far from complete, with 
persistence of high inflation amidst growth slowdown. Fall in domestic savings 
and high fiscal deficit are other major concerns for India. 
(Paras 1.8  – 1.23, Chapter I) 
? Corporate performance continues to be weighed down by boom period 
expansions and excess capacities, amid shifting asset composition towards 
financial investments.

(Paras1.24 - 1.27, Chapter I) 
? House prices and outstanding loans for housing by housing finance 
companies have grown relatively faster during the last few years. 
(Para 1.32, Chapter I) 
? Inadequate social security coverage in India against a backdrop of changing 
demographics will pose challenges for expanding the pension system given 
the fiscal constraints. The National Pension System (NPS) was created to 
serve Government employees and private sector workers. 
  (Paras 1.35 – 1.37, Chapter I) 
? The risks to the banking sector have further increased since the publication of 
the previous FSR in June this year. All major risk dimensions captured in the 
Banking Stability Indicator show increase in vulnerabilities in the banking 
sector.  
     (Para 2.1, Chapter II) 
? Network tools have been used to assess impact of contagion due to risk of 
credit concentration. Failure of a major corporate or a major corporate group 
could trigger a contagion in the banking system due to exposures of a large 
number of banks to such corporates. 
(Paras 2.4  – 2.17, Chapter II) 
? Asset quality continues to be a major concern for Scheduled Commercial 
Banks (SCBs). The Gross Non-performing Assets ratio of SCBs as well as 
their restructured standard advances ratio have increased. Therefore, the total 
stressed advances ratio rose significantly to 10.2 per cent of total advances as 
at end September 2013 from 9.2 per cent of March 2013. 
        (Paras 2.28 – 2.29, Chapter II) 
? Five sectors, namely, Infrastructure, Iron & Steel, Textiles, Aviation and Mining 
together contribute 24 percent of total advances of SCBs, and account for 
around 53 per cent of their total stressed advances.  
(Paras 2.34 – 2.37, Chapter II) 
? Macro stress tests on credit risk suggest that if the adverse macroeconomic 
conditions persist, the credit quality of commercial banks could deteriorate 
further. However, under improved conditions, the present trend in credit quality 
may reverse during the second half of 2014-15. 
 (Paras 2.51 – 2.61, Chapter II) 
? India stands committed to the implementation of the global regulatory reforms 
agenda and has made considerable progress on this front. Although firms and 
markets are beginning to adjust to the regulatory approach towards ending 
too-big-to-fail (TBTF), recent research indicates continued expectation of 
sovereign support to such institutions.  
   (Paras 3.1 – 3.5, Chapter III) 
? Due to the interconnectedness with banks, liquidity pressure is felt by the 
money market mutual funds (MMMFs) whenever redemption requirements of 
banks are large and simultaneous. Regulatory measures taken to reduce the 
degree of interconnectedness seem to have been successful in reducing the 
liquidity risk in the system. 3 
 
(Paras 3.13 – 3.17, Chapter III) 
? India’s domestic markets for interest rate derivatives have not taken off due to 
the absence of some of the basic building blocks. Efforts are on to address 
these issues.  
(Paras 3.22 – 3.26, Chapter III) 
? Action to create central repositories for the banking sector, corporate bond 
market and insurance sector has been initiated. This move is expected to 
break the information asymmetry in those markets.  
(Paras 3.31 – 3.37, Chapter III) 
? It has been observed that the equity prices of the companies in which the 
promoters had pledged significant portions of their shares, are relatively more 
volatile than the broader market during times of correction.
