Performance of Financial and Investment Companies, 2011-12 - Data Release 
The Reserve Bank of India today released on its website the data related to 
‘Performance of Financial and Investment Companies, 2011-12’. The data have been 
compiled based on audited annual accounts of select financial and investment 
companies. The data draw a comparative picture over the three year period 2009-10 
to 2011-12. ‘Explanatory notes’ are given at the end. 
In all, annual accounts of 1,349 companies were analysed. The select 1,349 
companies accounted for 52.1 per cent of population paid-up capital (PUC) 
(provisional estimate supplied by Ministry of Corporate Affairs, GoI) of all non-
government financial and investment companies as on March 31, 2012. 
However, results of HDFC, by virtue of its size, considerably influence the 
overall performance. Further, it was observed that results of six other companies 
were in large variance with the remaining companies. To maintain 
representativeness, 1,342 companies were included in final analysis. However, the 
results of all 1,349 companies are presented in Annex 1 to 3.  
Highlights: 
• The financial income of the select companies increased at a higher rate of 
29.5 per cent in 2011-12, as against an increase of 24.3 per cent registered in 
the previous year. Interest income grew by 51.0 per cent as against 41.8 per 
cent in previous year. 
• Total expenditure grew at higher rate of 37.9 per cent in 2011-12 as against 
17.3 per cent in 2010-11. Interest payments went up steeply by 66.2 per cent 
in 2011-12. 
• Growth in operating profits (i.e., earnings before depreciation and tax) as well 
as net profits of the companies were lower in 2011-12 as compared to the 
previous year.  
• Operating profit margin of select companies declined during 2011-12. This 
was witnessed across all activity groups except for ‘Asset Finance’ companies, 
which registered some improvement as compared to the previous year.  
• Similarly, return on assets declined across all activity groups except for ‘Asset 
Finance’ companies in 2011-12.  
• Growth in borrowings, particularly from banks decelerated during the year, as 
compared to 2010-11.

• Companies continued to rely heavily on external sources of funds. However, 
incremental borrowings through debentures and from banks declined during 
the year. 
• There was higher growth in loans and advances extended by the companies.  
Correspondingly, lower growth in investments was recorded across all activity 
groups in 2011-12. 
• Share of fresh investments in total uses of funds declined from 15.4 per cent in 
2010-11 to 4.7 per cent in 2011-12, while that of loans increased from 74.0 per 
cent to 92.7 per cent in 2011-12. 
An article analysing the performance of non-government financial and 
investment companies at the aggregate level as well as activity-wise, for a longer 
period is being published in the October 2013 issue of the RBI Bulletin.
