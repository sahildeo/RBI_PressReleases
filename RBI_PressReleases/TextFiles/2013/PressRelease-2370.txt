State Finances: A Study of Budgets of 2012-13 
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) today released a report “State Finances: A 
Study of Budgets of 2012-13”, an annual publication that provides data, analysis and 
an assessment of the finances of state governments. It also serves as a primary 
source for disaggregated state-wise fiscal data. 
All the key deficit indicators of states at the consolidated level are budgeted to 
improve in 2012-13, indicative of the states’ intent to carry forward fiscal 
consolidation as envisaged by the Thirteenth Finance Commission (FC-XIII). The 
consolidated revenue surplus of the state governments is budgeted to increase 
mainly due to an increase in the revenue receipts-GDP ratio, which is being 
supplemented by a reduction in the revenue expenditure-GDP ratio. The budgeted 
increase in revenue surplus would enable a higher capital outlay-GDP ratio for the 
states in 2012-13, even while reducing their consolidated GFD-GDP ratio. The 
majority of the states are expected to meet the deficit/debt targets set by the FC-XIII, 
indicating their commitment to the fiscal consolidation process. The challenge for the 
states is to avoid sacrificing the quality of fiscal adjustment in their endeavour to 
meet the incentivised quantitative targets.  
Sub-national Debt Sustainability: An Assessment of the State Governments 
The theme chapter, “Sub-national Debt Sustainability: An Assessment of the 
State Governments”, undertakes an assessment of public debt sustainability at the 
state level in India. Starting with the conceptual definition and measurement of debt, 
it traces the evolution of states’ debt in various phases. The concerted efforts at 
fiscal consolidation and institutional reforms enabled states to embark on the path of 
fiscal correction and consolidation. Although states have faced fiscal stress, there 
have been no instances of systemic insolvency and defaults. Indicator analysis of 
debt sustainability for states shows progress on most of indicators since the onset of 
fiscal consolidation. Although the necessary conditions for sustainability, viz., higher 
growth of GDP than debt growth and higher real output growth than real interest rate, 
are satisfied for the consolidated state governments during the phase of fiscal 
consolidation, the sufficient condition of generating primary surpluses has not been 
fulfilled in the post-fiscal consolidation phase. While the consolidated debt-GDP ratio of 
the states has significantly declined in recent years, growing contingent liabilities 
arising from guarantees to state public sector utilities pose a risk to state finances, 
unless monitored and adequately controlled. Moreover, the aggregate picture masks 
interstate disparities and vulnerabilities, which require customised reforms and 
corrective packages rather than a uniform across-the-board prescription.  
 Empirical evidence using panel regression analysis shows that apart from the 
reversal of the interest rate cycle, the higher growth in nominal GSDP and policy 
measures such as the debt swap scheme (DSS) and the debt consolidation and 
relief facility (DCRF) contributed to the debt reduction of the states. The approach to  
?nullnull???nullnullnull??2 
 
debt relief, linked with incentives to implement reforms, has greatly helped avoid 
moral hazard problems. Going forward, given that restructuring of all past high-cost 
debt of the states has already been undertaken and there is limited fiscal space 
available with the centre, substantial debt relief and interest relief measures from the 
centre may not be forthcoming. It is, therefore, necessary that states focus on 
revenue-enhancing and expenditure compression measures that are more durable to 
improve their debt sustainability. Further, as tax revenue is more sensitive to growth 
cycles, prudent expenditure management measures, which contain non-productive 
expenditure while simultaneously providing for counter-cyclical growth-inducing 
expenditure, may be required to maintain and strengthen debt sustainability. 
 Issues in State Finances 
The report highlights several issues of significance and concern for the state 
governments. With the second phase of a rule-based fiscal consolidation path 
underway, some key challenges that the state governments need to address are: 
improving tax efforts by increasing efficiency and other initiatives; reorienting 
expenditure policies to improve the quality of expenditure, while also aiming at fiscal 
sustainability in the medium term; enhancing fiscal transparency so as to enable 
effective monitoring of the quality, durability and effectiveness of the fiscal correction 
process; factoring in the fiscal implications of the financial restructuring package for 
state discoms; and strengthening the supply chain through legislative interventions 
and building appropriate infrastructure. 
Major findings of the Study 
State finances budgeted to improve further in 2012-13 
• Key deficit indicators of the states are budgeted to show improvement during 
2012-13. While the consolidated revenue surplus is budgeted to increase to 
0.4 per cent of GDP in 2012-13 from 0.1 per cent in 2011-12, GFD and PD as 
ratios to GDP are budgeted to decline to 2.1 per cent and 0.6 per cent, 
respectively, in 2012-13 from 2.3 per cent and 0.8 per cent, respectively, in 
2011-12. 
• The consolidated revenue surplus is budgeted to increase due to an increase 
in revenue receipts coupled with a reduction in revenue expenditure. Both 
own revenues and current transfers from the centre are budgeted to increase 
during 2012-13. The revenue surplus is expected not only to provide 
resources for increased capital outlay during 2012-13 but would also enable a 
reduction in the GFD-GDP ratio.  
Improvement in key fiscal indicators to be broad-based across States 
• For 2012-13, state governments are expected to strengthen their fiscal 
position, which would be primarily contributed by increasing surplus in the 
revenue account, with 23 of the 28 states budgeting for revenue surplus 
during 2012-13. The capital outlay is budgeted to be higher during 2012-13 in 
the majority of the revenue surplus states, indicating that the quality of 
expenditure is not being compromised in achieving the deficit targets.    
• A comparison of the fiscal performance of states with the FC-XIII targets for 
deficits indicates that while the envisaged revenue balance may be achieved 
by most of the states, the GFD-GSDP ratio is budgeted to exceed the FC-
XIII’s target in 2012-13 in two special category (SC) states and one non-
special category (NSC) state.

Decline in States’ overall debt-GDP ratio to continue in 2012-13  
• Despite the increase in aggregate market borrowings by the state 
governments, the consolidated debt-GDP ratio of the states continued to 
decline in 2011-12, reflecting the impact of a faster increase in nominal GDP 
relative to overall debt. During 2012-13, the consolidated debt-GDP ratio of 
the states is expected to decline further and remain below the FC-XIII’s 
recommended benchmark, indicating the continuation of the fiscal 
consolidation process at the state level.
