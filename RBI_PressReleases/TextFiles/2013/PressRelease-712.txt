Mid-Quarter Monetary Policy Review: September 2013 
Statement by Dr. Raghuram G. Rajan 
Governor, Reserve Bank of India 
"Good Afternoon.  In the mid-quarter review today, we began a calibrated 
change in the exceptional liquidity measures we introduced in July by cutting the 
Marginal ‘Standing Facility rate, which is the effective policy rate today by 75  basis 
points or 0.75 percentage points.  
We also reduced the minimum daily CRR balance that banks have to maintain 
to 95% of the requirement.   
We believe that easing the exceptional liquidity measures was warranted 
given that the external environment has improved and given that the Government 
and the RBI have used the time since the measures were put in place to narrow the 
current account deficit and to ease its financing.   
The calibrated withdrawal will provide a boost to growth, reduce the financing 
distortions that are emerging in the market, and reduce the strain on corporate and 
bank balance sheets.  We remain vigilant about external market conditions and will 
do what is necessary if they deteriorate once again. 
We have also announced an intention to return to normal monetary operations 
where the repo rate will return to being the effective policy rate and liquidity 
conditions need not be as tight as they currently are.  Let me emphasize that the 
difference between the MSF and repo rate will be brought down to 100 basis points.  
At the same time, recognizing that inflationary pressures are mounting and 
determined to establish a nominal anchor which will allow us to preserve the internal 
value of the rupee, we have raised the repo rate by 25   basis points.  
The intent here is that when the repo rate becomes the effective policy rate, it 
should be consistent with inflationary conditions in the economy. On net, these 
measures will reduce the cost of bank financing substantially while allowing us to 
take an appropriately precautionary stance on inflation.  
Let us remember that the postponement of tapering is only that, a 
postponement.  We must use this time to create a bullet proof national balance sheet 
and growth agenda, which creates confidence in citizens and investors alike.

At the Reserve Bank of India, my colleagues and I have been busy developing 
the measures we announced about two weeks ago.  Yesterday, the RBI implemented 
the full liberalization of bank branching, with some safeguards to encourage 
inclusion.  We announced both the FCNR(B) swap facility as well as the swap facility 
for bank borrowings. 
I am glad to say that banks have started bringing in money.  Till yesterday, we 
had received  $ 466 million  through the FCNR(B) and $ 917 million through the swap 
facility to a total of nearly $ 1.4 billion.  We have started the process to issue two 
kinds of retail inflation indexed retail certificates, one with a lump sum payment at the 
end and the other with indexed interest payments.  We have set up the central credit 
registry for large bank borrowers.  The various committees we announced are 
swinging into action.  
Over the next few weeks, together with the government, we will take a close 
look at corporate distress and bank NPAs to see how we can accelerate the process 
of resolution.   
Finally, we are taking a look at a variety of markets to deepen them and make 
them more vibrant.  Measures will be announced periodically."
