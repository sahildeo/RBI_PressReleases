Currency Swap Arrangement with Japan enhanced to US$ 50 billion 
Indian and Japanese Governments have decided to expand their bilateral 
currency swap arrangement from US$ 15 to US$ 50 billion. It is expected that this will 
contribute to the stability of financial markets. The Government of India and the 
Reserve Bank of India will discuss and finalise the terms of this enhancement with 
their Japanese counterparts.  
It may be recalled that on December 4, 2012 a bilateral swap agreement was 
signed between the Bank of Japan and the Reserve Bank of India for US$ 15 billion. 
This arrangement aimed at addressing possible short-term liquidity mismatches and 
supplementing existing international financial arrangements, is part of the effort to 
strengthen mutual cooperation between Japan and India.
