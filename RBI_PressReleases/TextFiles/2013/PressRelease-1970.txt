Mid-Quarter Monetary Policy Review: March 2013 
Monetary and Liquidity Measures  
Based on an assessment of the current macroeconomic situation, it has been 
decided to:  
• reduce the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) by 25 
basis points from 7.75 per cent to 7.5 per cent with immediate effect;  
Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF stands adjusted to 6.5 per 
cent and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate to 8.5 per cent 
with immediate effect.  
Introduction  
2. Since the Reserve Bank’s Third Quarter Review (TQR) of January 2013, 
global financial market conditions have improved, but global economic activity has 
weakened. On the domestic front too, growth has decelerated significantly, even as 
inflation remains at a level which is not conducive for sustained economic growth. 
Although there has been notable softening of non-food manufactured products 
inflation, food inflation remains high, driving a wedge between wholesale price and 
consumer price inflation, and is exacerbating the challenge for monetary 
management in anchoring inflationary expectations.

Global Economy  
3. Global economic developments over the last few months present a mixed 
picture. US GDP estimates for Q4 of 2012 indicate a tentative upturn on the back of 
improvement in housing and payroll employment. However, US macroeconomic 
prospects are clouded by the uncertainty surrounding the temporary appropriations 
and the debt ceiling. In the euro area, plagued by contingent risks of political 
uncertainty and adjustment fatigue, GDP shrank for the third successive quarter in 
Q4. Output in Japan too contracted in Q4, and it is as yet unclear how effective the 
emerging package of stimulus measures will be and how quickly they will turn 
around the economy. While some emerging and developing economies (EDEs), 
including China, are gradually returning to faster growth, activity is slowing in 
others, hobbled by weak external demand and slack domestic investment. 
International non-fuel commodity prices have softened in Q4, but fuel prices have 
remained firm, despite the growth slowdown, portending persisting inflationary 
pressures, particularly for net energy importers.  
Domestic Economy  
Growth  
4. India’s GDP growth in Q3 of 2012-13, at 4.5 per cent,  was the weakest in 
the last 15 quarters. What is worrisome is that the services sector growth, hitherto 
the mainstay of overall growth, has also decelerated to its slowest pace in a decade. 
While overall industrial production growth turned positive in January, capital 
goods production and mining activity continued to contract. The composite 
purchasing managers’ index (PMI) declined in February, largely reflecting slower 
expansion in services. In the agriculture sector, the second advance estimates of 
kharif production indicate a decline in relation to the level last year. However, that 
may be offset, at least partly, by the rabi output for which sowing has been 
satisfactory.

Inflation  
5. The year-on-year headline WPI inflation edged up to 6.8 per cent in 
February 2013 from 6.6 per cent in January, essentially reflecting the upward 
revisions effected to administered prices of petroleum products. On the other hand, 
non-food manufactured products inflation, and its momentum, continued to ebb 
along the trajectory that began in September 2012, enabled by softening prices of 
metals, textiles and rubber products. Worryingly, retail inflation continued on the 
upward path that set in from October 2012, with the new combined (rural and 
urban) CPI (Base: 2010=100) inflation at a high of 10.9 per cent in February 2013 
on sustained price pressures from food items, especially cereals and proteins. 
Consequently, the divergence between wholesale and consumer price inflation 
continued to widen during the year.  
Monetary and Liquidity Conditions  
6. Money supply (M ) and bank credit growth have broadly moved in alignment 
3
with their revised indicative trajectories. With government cash balances with the 
Reserve Bank persisting at a higher than normal level, the liquidity deficit, as 
reflected by the net drawals by banks under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF), 
has remained above the indicative comfort zone. The reduction in the cash reserve 
ratio (CRR) of banks by 25 basis points, effective from February 9 and open market 
purchases of `200 billion since February have enabled money market rates to  
remain anchored to the policy repo rate. The Reserve Bank will continue to actively 
manage liquidity through various instruments, including open market operations 
(OMO), so as to ensure adequate flow of credit to productive sectors of the 
economy.

Fiscal Situation 
7. The Union Budget for 2013-14 has made a firm commitment to fiscal 
consolidation. According to the revised budget estimates for 2012-13, the gross 
fiscal deficit (GFD)-GDP ratio, at 5.2 per cent, was contained around its budgeted 
level, mainly by scaling down plan and capital expenditures. The GFD-GDP ratio 
is programmed to decline to 4.8 per cent in 2013-14 and further down to 3.0 per 
cent by 2016-17, in line with the revised road map for fiscal consolidation.   
External Sector  
8. With merchandise exports recording positive growth for the second 
successive month in February and non-oil imports contracting, the trade deficit 
narrowed significantly. For April-February 2012-13, however, the trade deficit was 
higher than its level a year ago with adverse implications for the current account 
deficit (CAD), already at a record high. Although capital inflows, mainly in the form 
of portfolio investment and debt flows, provided adequate financing, the growing 
vulnerability of the external sector to abrupt shifts in sentiment remains a key 
concern.  
Outlook  
9. There are several risks to the global outlook. The impact of sequestration in 
the US on the global economy is likely to be muted in view of legislation initiated to 
avert the debt ceiling. Nevertheless, lead indicators point to sluggish global growth. 
Political economy risks that block or delay credible and determined policy actions in 
advanced economies (AEs) are inhibiting recovery. For EDEs, risks of spillovers 
from AEs remain significant. While global inflationary pressures are likely to be 
subdued, given still large output gaps, several EDEs could potentially face the threat 
of elevated energy prices.

10. On the domestic front, the key macroeconomic priorities are to raise the 
growth rate, restrain inflation pressures and mitigate the vulnerability of the external 
sector. These are briefly addressed in the following paragraphs. 
11. The Central Statistics Office (CSO) has projected GDP growth for 2012-13 of 
5.0 per cent, lower than the Reserve Bank’s baseline projection of 5.5 per cent set 
out in the TQR, reflecting slower than expected growth in both industry and 
services. Key to reinvigorating growth is accelerating investment. The government 
has a critical role to play in this regard by remaining committed to fiscal 
consolidation, easing the supply bottlenecks and improving governance surrounding 
project implementation.  
12. On the inflation front, some softening of global commodity prices and lower 
pricing power of corporates domestically is moderating non-food manufactured 
products inflation. However, the unrelenting rise in food inflation is keeping 
headline wholesale price inflation above the threshold level and consumer price 
inflation in double digits. Also, there is still some suppressed inflation related to 
administered prices which carries latent inflationary pressures. All this complicates 
the task of inflation management and underscores the imperative of addressing 
supply constraints. From an inflation perspective, upward revisions in the minimum 
support prices (MSP) should warrant caution in view of their implications for overall 
inflation. 
13. On the external sector front, the key challenge is to reduce the CAD, which is 
well above the sustainable threshold.  This adjustment, requiring as it does, measures 
to improve the competitiveness of exports and wean away demand for unproductive 
imports, will inevitably take time. Meanwhile, financing of the CAD with stable 
flows remains a challenge.

14. The foremost challenge for returning the economy to a high growth trajectory 
is to revive investment. A competitive interest rate is necessary for this, but not 
sufficient. Sufficiency conditions include bridging the supply constraints, staying the 
course on fiscal consolidation, both in terms of quantity and quality, and improving 
governance.  
Guidance  
15.  Notwithstanding moderation in non-food manufactured products inflation, 
headline inflation is expected to be range-bound around current levels over 2013-14 
in view of sectoral demand-supply imbalances, the ongoing corrections in 
administered prices and their second-round effects. In addition, elevated food prices, 
including pressures stemming from MSP increases, and the wedge between 
wholesale and retail inflation have adverse implications for inflation expectations.  
Risks on account of the CAD remain significant notwithstanding likely 
improvement in Q4 over an expected sharp deterioration in Q3 of 2012-13. 
Accordingly, even as the policy stance emphasises addressing the growth risks, the 
headroom for further monetary easing remains quite limited.
