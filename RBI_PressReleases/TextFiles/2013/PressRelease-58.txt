RBI cautions users of Virtual Currencies against Risks 
The Reserve Bank of India has today cautioned the users, holders and 
traders of Virtual currencies (VCs), including Bitcoins, about the potential financial, 
operational, legal, customer protection and security related risks that they are 
exposing themselves to.  
 The Reserve Bank has mentioned that it has been looking at the 
developments relating to certain electronic records claimed to be “Decentralised 
Digital Currency” or “Virtual Currency” (VCs), such as, Bitcoins, litecoins, bbqcoins, 
dogecoins etc., their usage or trading in the country and the various media reports in 
this regard.  
The creation, trading or usage of VCs including Bitcoins, as a medium for 
payment are not authorised by any central bank or monetary authority. No regulatory 
approvals, registration or authorisation is stated to have been obtained by the 
entities concerned for carrying on such activities. As such, they may pose several 
risks to their users, including the following:  
? VCs being in digital form are stored in digital/electronic media that are called 
electronic wallets. Therefore, they are prone to losses arising out of hacking, 
loss of password, compromise of access credentials, malware attack etc. 
Since they are not created by or traded through any authorised central 
registry or agency, the loss of the e-wallet could result in the permanent loss 
of the VCs held in them.  
? Payments by VCs, such as Bitcoins, take place on a peer-to-peer basis 
without an authorised central agency which regulates such payments. As 
such, there is no established framework for recourse to customer problems / 
disputes / charge backs etc.  
? There is no underlying or backing of any asset for VCs. As such, their value 
seems to be a matter of speculation. Huge volatility in the value of VCs has 
been noticed in the recent past. Thus, the users are exposed to potential 
losses on account of such volatility in value.  
? It is reported that VCs, such as Bitcoins, are being traded on exchange 
platforms set up in various jurisdictions whose legal status is also unclear. 
Hence, the traders of VCs on such platforms are exposed to legal as well as 
financial risks.  
? There have been several media reports of the usage of VCs, including 
Bitcoins, for illicit and illegal activities in several jurisdictions. The absence of 
information of counterparties in such peer-to-peer anonymous/ 
pseudonymous systems could subject the users to unintentional breaches of 
anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) 
laws.

The Reserve Bank has also stated that it is presently examining the issues 
associated with the usage, holding and trading of VCs under the extant legal and 
regulatory framework of the country, including Foreign Exchange and Payment 
Systems laws and regulations.
