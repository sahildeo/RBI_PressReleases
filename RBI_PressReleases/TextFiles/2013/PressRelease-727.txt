RBI Working Paper Series - 7 
Size of Government Expenditure Multipliers in India:  
A Structural VAR Analysis 
 
The Reserve Bank today placed on its website a Working Paper titled “Size of 
Government Expenditure Multipliers in India: A Structural VAR Analysis”. The paper 
has been authored by Dr. Rajeev Jain and Shri Prabhat Kumar.  
In the recent years, active fiscal policy has been used across countries to 
mitigate the negative macroeconomic shocks generated by the global financial crisis 
in credit markets and banking systems. This, in turn, led to a considerable discussion 
among policy makers and researchers regarding the potential effectiveness of fiscal 
policy as a stabilisation tool. In case of India as well, the Central government 
undertook three stimulus packages during December 2008 - March 2009. Thus, it is 
important to estimate the size of expenditure multipliers as it not only reflects upon 
the quality and effectiveness of fiscal policy but also assumes importance when 
there is a need for undertaking a credible fiscal consolidation.  
Against this background, a study “Size of Government Expenditure Multipliers 
in India: A Structural VAR Analysis” was undertaken which estimated the size of 
expenditure multiplier at the level of Central and the State governments, using 
annual data for the period from 1980-81 to 2011-12. The structural vector 
autoregression framework was used to gauge the effects of various categories of 
government expenditure on India’s GDP. The major findings of the paper are: 
? It is estimated that combined expenditure by Centre and States leads to a 
multiplier effect of 0.59 on GDP. Since the revenue expenditure accounts for a 
major share in aggregate expenditure at both levels of government, the 
impact multiplier for overall expenditure is estimated to be less than one and it 
is found that the positive impact dissipates immediately after the first year of 
shock. 
? The size of multiplier for all categories of expenditure by State governments is 
estimated to be larger than that of the Central government. As was a priori 
expected, capital outlay is found to be more growth inducing and have 
prolonged impact than revenue expenditure in case of both, Centre and 
States.  
? Empirical findings suggest the need for change in composition of expenditure 
in favour of capital outlay and greater decentralisation of expenditure.
