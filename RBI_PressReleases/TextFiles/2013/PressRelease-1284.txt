RBI Board meets in Chennai 
The Central Board of the Reserve Bank of India met today at Chennai. Dr. D. 
Subbarao, Governor, Reserve Bank of India, chaired the meeting. Dr. Anil Kakodkar, 
Shri Kiran Karnik, Prof. M.V. Rajeev Gowda, Dr. Nachiket M. Mor, Shri Y.H. 
Malegam,      Shri Azim Premji, Shri K.M. Birla, Prof. Dipankar Gupta, Shri G.M. Rao, 
Dr. Indira Rajaraman, Shri Y.C. Deveshwar and Prof. Damodar Acharya, Directors, 
attended the meeting. Dr. K.C. Chakrabarty, Shri Anand Sinha, Shri Harun R. Khan 
and Dr. Urjit R. Patel, Deputy Governors, were also present. 
The Board reviewed the current economic situation and global and domestic 
challenges and policy responses. 
 The Central Board meets at least once every quarter. Apart from holding 
meetings in Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata and one in New Delhi after the Union Budget, 
which is addressed by the Finance Minister, the rest of the meetings are held in other 
state capitals by rotation. The main function of the Central Board of Directors of the 
Reserve Bank is to provide overall direction to its affairs.  
Earlier, on July 3, 2013, the Governor chaired a special State Level Bankers’ 
Committee meeting. The meeting was attended by senior officials of the State 
Government, banks and the Reserve Bank. The following decisions were taken at 
this meeting: 
? Banks in Tamil Nadu should speed up opening of branches and bank 
accounts in remote areas of the State as infrastructure in Tamil Nadu was 
relatively better. They should also improve the ratio of physical branches to 
bring it closer to the stipulated 25 per cent.  
? In the next two months, the State Government will identify 10 districts of the 
State where Business Correspondents (BCs) can be trained, with the help of 
banks, in actual banking activities/products so as to enable them to increase 
business. 
? In order to have a better understanding, the State Government would, through 
senior officers of District Industries Centre (DIC), initiate a study of banks on 
granting loans of less than ? 10 lakh without collaterals in four more districts of 
Tamil Nadu.  The Reserve Bank will also associate with the study. Earlier, the 
Reserve Bank had undertaken a study of four districts in Tamil Nadu to assess 
whether banks were insisting on collaterals for loans below ?10 lakh. It was 
observed that substantial part of loans under this category was granted 
without insisting on collaterals.

? Bankers would support the State Government’s effort in 
furthering agricultural insurance scheme, in six districts identified by the State. 
 
 Dwelling at length on the fraudulent money collection schemes prevalent in 
the country, the Governor stated that although schemes like chit funds and multi-level 
marketing companies did not fall under the jurisdiction of the Reserve Bank, it had, as 
a public policy measure undertaken to create awareness about these schemes. The 
Reserve Bank of India has, for instance, published in 13 languages, frequently asked 
questions (FAQs) about non-banking financial companies.  It also conducted a town 
hall meeting in Chandigarh on the subject in partnership with a national television 
channel. The Governor, then stressed on the need to sensitise police officials on this 
issue so that they give priority to these complaints. The Governor also emphasised 
the need to fast track the disposal of seized assets of the fraudsters to repay the 
public deposits. He informed that the Reserve Bank Staff College at Chennai would 
draw up a training capsule especially for senior police officials and urged the State 
Government to help the Reserve Bank in ramping up publicity about such fraudulent 
schemes through its district machinery. Since the public was generally unaware 
about who regulates what, the Reserve Bank has announced that the public could 
complain to any regulator and all regulators would coordinate resolution of complaints 
among themselves.
