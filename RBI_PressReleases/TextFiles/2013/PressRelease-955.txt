Avoid Last Minute Rush; Pay IT in Advance at Bank Branches/RBI: 
RBI appeals to Public 
The Reserve Bank of India has appealed to public to avoid last minute rush 
and remit their Income-tax dues sufficiently in advance of the due date of September 
30, 2013. It has also urged the assessees to take advantage of paying taxes at select 
branches of accredited agency banks which have been authorised to accept 
payments of Income Tax dues.  Most of these banks also provide facilities for on-line 
payment of taxes, it has added.   
The rush for remitting Income Tax dues through the Reserve Bank of India has 
been far too heavy towards the end of September and it becomes difficult for the 
Reserve Bank to cope with the pressure of receipts despite opening additional 
counters to the maximum extent possible for the purpose.  Consequently, members 
of public are required to wait in queues at the Reserve Bank for unnecessarily long 
periods.  
The banks authorised to accept payment of Income Tax dues in Mumbai are:  
1. Allahabad Bank 16. Syndicate Bank 
2. Andhra Bank 17. UCO Bank 
3. Bank of Baroda 18. Union Bank of India 
4. Bank of India 19. United Bank of India 
5. Bank of Maharashtra 20. Vijaya Bank 
6. Canara Bank 21. State Bank of India
