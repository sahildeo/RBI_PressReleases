            April 10, 2013  
RBI releases its monthly Bulletin for April 2013 
The Reserve Bank of India today released the April 2013 issue of its monthly 
Bulletin. The Bulletin includes three special articles: (i) India’s Foreign Trade: 2012-
13 (April - December); (ii) North-East Monsoon 2012: An Overview (October - 
December) and (iii) Investment Portfolio of Scheduled Commercial Banks: March 
2012. 
1. India’s Foreign Trade: 2012-13 (April - December) 
India’s trade performance continued to show deterioration in H1 of 2012 as export 
recorded a sharper decline than imports. The deterioration in export performance 
was broad-based in H1 of 2012-13 as compared with H2 of 2011-12 as concerns 
regarding global slowdown had escalated during the period. Major highlights of 
India’s trade performance during the period of April-December 2012-13 are set out 
below: 
• The export figures during April-December 2012 stood at US$ 214.1 billion with 
a decline of 5.5 per cent as compared to a growth of 29.6 per cent during 
April-December 2011.  
• Imports during this period, at a level of US$ 361.3 billion registered a decline 
of 0.7 per cent as against an increase of 35.2 per cent in April-December 
2011.  
• The decline in imports was mainly on account of the fall in gold and non-oil 
non-gold imports. Import of petroleum, oil and lubricants (POL) continued to 
rise, notwithstanding a decline in international prices of crude oil (Indian 
basket). 
• The greater fall in exports than in imports resulted in a trade deficit of US$ 
147.2 billion during April-December 2012, of which, oil deficit contributed the 
most at the level of US$ 85.4 billion. 
• The disaggregated data for merchandise exports of commodities during H1 of 
2012-13 show that decline in exports was largely on account of reversal of 
growth momentum in case of exports of petroleum products and engineering 
goods. 
• Exports to EU countries have been severely impacted due to sluggish 
demand, particularly in Germany, Italy, UK and Belgium. Reflecting adverse 
spillovers from advanced economies to other economies, India’s exports to 
most EMDEs either declined or showed decelerated growth during H1 of 
2012-13 as compared with the corresponding period of 2011-12.

2. North-East Monsoon 2012: An Overview (October - December) 
The North-East monsoon during October-December 2012 was 21 per cent 
below its long period average (LPA) as against 48 per cent below LPA a year ago. 
The overall production of rabi foodgrains in 2012-13 is estimated marginally lower at 
125.5 million tonnes (128.1 million tonnes in 2011-12). Rabi pulses are poised for a 
record production while the production  of rabi oilseeds is estimated to increase. Rabi 
sowing has picked-up in the latter part of the season, with total area coverage under 
rabi crops being around 101 per cent of normal at the end of the season, marginally 
higher than that of the previous year. 
3. Investment Portfolio of Scheduled Commercial Banks: March 2012 
The article presents an analysis of the investment portfolio of scheduled 
commercial banks (excluding Regional Rural Banks) as at end-March 2012, based 
on annual Basic Statistical Return 5 (BSR-5).  
 The major findings of the article are as follows: 
• The outstanding investments of the scheduled commercial banks (SCBs)  
increased by 19.8 per cent in 2011-12 as compared with 8.9 per cent growth in 
the previous year. 
• Investment of SCBs in government securities increased by 23.1 per cent in 
2011-12 as compared to 9.1 per cent increase in other domestic securities.  
• SCBs investment in securities of joint stock companies grew at 25.2 per cent 
in 2011-12 on top of 28.1 per cent growth in 2010-11; however, investments in 
certificate of deposits and commercial papers declined by 8.0 per cent.  
• The weighted average coupon rate of central government securities held by 
banks increased by 4 bps to 7.85 per cent and that of state government 
securities increased by 14 bps to 7.87 per cent in 2011-12. 
• The maturity profile of the central government securities held by the SCBs 
showed that the share of securities with long-term maturities of more than 11 
years declined to 13.2 per cent as at end-March 2012 from 18.1 per cent in the 
previous year.  
• The maturity profile of very short-term holdings (maturing within one year) had 
a share of 21.0 per cent as at end-March 2012 as against 14.8 per cent as at 
end-March 2011, mainly due to steep increase in holdings of Treasury bills. In 
the case of foreign banks, Treasury bills constituted more than half of their 
holdings in government securities.  
• About 44 per cent of SCBs’ holding in central and state government dated 
securities (excluding Treasury bills) were with a residual maturity of 6 to 11 
years as at end-March 2012. The average residual maturity was reduced to 
7.18 years as on March 31, 2012 from 7.37 years a year ago.
