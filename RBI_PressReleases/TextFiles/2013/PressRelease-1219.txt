RBI announces Measures to address Exchange Rate Volatility 
The market perception of likely tapering of US Quantitative Easing has triggered outflows 
of portfolio investment, particularly from the debt segment. Consequently, the Rupee has 
depreciated markedly in the last six weeks. Countries with large current account deficits, such as 
India, have been particularly affected despite their relatively promising economic fundamentals. 
The exchange rate pressure also evidences that the demand for foreign currency has increased vis-
a-vis that of the Rupee in part because of the improving domestic liquidity situation. 
 
Against this backdrop, and the need to restore stability to the foreign exchange market, the 
following measures are announced:  
i) The Marginal Standing Facility (MSF) rate is recalibrated with immediate effect to be 300 
basis points above the policy repo rate under the Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF). 
Consequently, the MSF rate will now be 10.25 per cent.  
ii) Accordingly, the Bank Rate also stands adjusted to 10.25 per cent with immediate effect. 
iii) The overall allocation of funds under the LAF will be limited to 1.0 per cent of the Net 
Demand and Time Liabilities (NDTL) of the banking system, reckoned as Rs.75,000 crore 
for this purpose. The allocation to individual banks will be made in proportion to their bids, 
subject to the overall ceiling. This change in LAF will come into effect from July 17, 2013. 
iv) The Reserve Bank will conduct Open Market Sales of Government of India Securities of 
 
Rs.12,000 crore on July 18, 2013. Details of the securities included for the OMO sale 
auction will be announced through a separate press release tomorrow.  
 The Reserve Bank will continue to closely monitor the markets, the liquidity situation and 
the macroeconomic developments and will take such other measures as may be necessary, 
consistent with the growth-inflation dynamics and macroeconomic stability.
