India: Financial System Stability Assessment  
Consequent upon the IMF Board decision adopted on September 21, 2010 it 
was decided to include 25 systemically important economies, including India, under 
the Financial Stability Assessment Programme (FSAP) for members with 
systemically important financial sectors. The joint IMF-World Bank Financial Stability 
Assessment Programme (FSAP) was conducted for India. IMF has now released 
their report on the Financial Sector Stability Assessment for India. The Reserve Bank 
of India (RBI), the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) and the Insurance 
Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) welcome the comprehensive review 
of the Indian financial system by the joint IMF-World Bank team. The Indian financial 
system has been assessed in relation to the highest international standards.  
2. The assessment recognises that the Indian financial system remained largely 
stable on account of a sound regulatory and supervisory regime. However, the 
assessment identifies some gaps, including in international and domestic 
supervisory information sharing and co-operation, consolidated supervision of 
financial conglomerates, and some limits on the de jure independence of the 
regulators (RBI and IRDA).  
3. RBI, recognising their importance, has made efforts to establish information 
sharing mechanisms with various jurisdictions in which Indian banks are operating. 
RBI has so far entered into information-sharing MoUs with 12 jurisdictions. An 
additional 2 MoUs are scheduled to be signed shortly. Furthermore, RBI has carried 
out overseas inspections of Indian bank branches in the UK, the USA, Bahrain, Hong 
Kong and Singapore covering around 60 per cent of their total assets overseas. 
Efforts are also underway to establish supervisory colleges. The IRDA is also 
addressing issues relating to sharing of information at the international level through 
entering into a Multilateral Memorandum of Understanding (MMoU) under the aegis 
of the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS). 
4. With regard to the issue of large exposure limits, it is true that the group 
borrower limit is higher than international norms. Some of the major corporate 
groups are key drivers of growth of the Indian economy. Keeping the group borrower 
limit at the level of the single borrower limit would severely constrain the availability 
of bank finance, which would hamper the growth of the economy.  
5. RBI recognises that there could be moral hazard issues posed by the 
appointment of an RBI officer as a nominee director on the banks’ board. However, 
this system has served India well and ensured more effective compliance with RBI 
regulations from the banks’ side. Nevertheless, RBI is sensitive to the issue and has 
taken up the matter with Government of India for amendment of the enabling legal 
provisions.

6. As regards Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) hampering monetary transmission 
mechanism, it is observed that the SLR holding of banks has been brought down 
over time. As government market borrowings are at market-determined interest 
rates, monetary policy transmission is not impeded by SLR holdings. The holding of 
government bonds could help banks to better cope with financial stress situations by 
giving greater access to liquidity. While the Financial System Stability Assessment 
(FSSA) recognises the benefit of Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR)/SLR in providing 
liquidity to banks in crisis time, the financial stability enhancing role played by them is 
also important. Nevertheless, steps are underway to enhance liquidity in government 
securities market. 
7. With respect to securities markets regulation, SEBI has clear regulatory 
framework for all market segments and products, including the structure and 
operations of collective investment schemes. SEBI has taken several steps to re-
energise mutual fund industry to increase product penetration especially in smaller 
cities/towns: regulation of distributors, advisors, and issues concerning investor 
protection; develop a long-term policy; and increase household savings through 
mutual funds.  
8. As regards better auditing and accounting standards in the securities market, 
the Companies Act and Chartered Accountants Act provide a framework  to maintain 
objectivity and integrity of accounting and audit. The Government of India has set up 
Quality Review Board (QRB) for reviewing the quality of auditors. The Companies 
Bill 2012 as passed by Lok Sabha contains provisions for establishment of an 
independent quasi-judicial agency, the National Financial Reporting Authority, to 
oversee the functions of Auditors and to ensure scrutiny and compliance with 
accounting and auditing standards. SEBI has set up a Forensic Accounting Cell on 
February 7, 2012 to improve quality of financial information disclosed and to assist in 
detection of financial irregularities. To enhance the quality of financial reporting done 
by listed entities, SEBI has set up a Qualified Audit Report Review Committee 
(QARC) on which ICAI, Stock Exchanges and others are represented. 
9. As far as recommendation of the assessor to establish independent risk 
committees in Central Counter Parties (CCPs) is concerned, SEBI has already 
decided in April 2012, while reviewing the ownership and governance of Market 
Infrastructure Institutions (MIIs), that CCPs will constitute a risk committee 
comprising independent members which shall report to the Board of the CCP as well 
as directly to SEBI on issues and matters so identified and prescribed. 
10. With regard to strengthening the supervision of intermediaries, the level of 
enforcement action taken by SEBI is very high. SEBI has used warnings and letters 
of deficiency to address findings from inspection reports, although in a few cases 
‘harder’ measures, such as disgorgement and payment of money under adjudication 
or consent proceedings, have been imposed. Theme-based inspections have been 
carried out by SEBI in respect of market intermediaries, mutual funds, depositories, 
stock exchanges, etc.  
11. Under the framework of recently constituted inter-regulatory Early Warning 
Group (EWG) for financial markets under the Financial Stability and Development 
Council (FSDC) Sub-Committee, SEBI has constituted an Early Warning Team 
which monitors and takes steps to address various potential crisis scenarios as per 
the crisis prevention and management plan of SEBI. 
12. SEBI has laid down a two-tier supervision system for mutual funds. At the first 
level the trustees of mutual funds supervise the day-to-day operations of mutual 
funds. Further, the mutual funds are required to periodically report on their 
operations/activities to SEBI. A risk-based approach is followed in this regard.

13. With respect to regulation of the insurance industry, IRDA is of the view that 
there is complete oversight over the Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) with 
regard to both market conduct and prudential regulations. While Indian Third Party 
Motor Pool has been dismantled in the year 2012, in its place the framework for 
Motor Third Party Declined Risk Insurance Pool has been put in place.  The issues 
relating to inadequacy of reserves have also been addressed through directions 
issued to increase the premium in this segment. The enforcement powers are being 
strengthened in the proposed Insurance Laws (Amendment) Bill. IRDA is working 
towards a comprehensive fraud monitoring policy for both life and non-life insurance 
companies.  Further, the IRDA is also examining various issues relating to moving 
towards the risk-based approach to solvency. 
14. With regard to the information sharing and co-ordination among domestic 
regulatory authorities, it may be noted that the FSDC, under the chairmanship of 
Finance Minister, provides for effective regulatory co-ordination.  
15. With regard to the de jure autonomy of regulatory bodies, it merits 
consideration that financial sector regulators in India operate within statutory 
frameworks that prudently balance the role of Government in policy making with 
autonomy and independence for regulatory bodies to transparently perform 
regulatory functions through exercise of statutory powers.  The de facto position too 
reveals no interference in the functioning of regulators.  Steps are underway to 
accord a statutory basis to the pensions regulator also.  To streamline and further 
strengthen the statutory framework, comprising an array of statutes enacted since 
1930s and address regulatory overlaps, the Financial Sector Legislative Reforms 
Commission (FSLRC) has been set up by Government, which is expected to give its 
report by March 2013. 
16. Despite having reservations on a few issues, overall the Indian authorities 
expect the FSAP exercise to play a significant role in shaping our post-crisis 
initiatives to strengthen the regulatory and supervisory architecture based on the 
evolving international consensus as well as careful examination of their relevance in 
the India-specific context. As a member of the FSB, BCBS and IMF, India is actively 
participating in post-crisis reforms of the international regulatory and supervisory 
framework under the aegis of the G20. India remains committed to adoption of 
international standards and best practices, in a phased manner and calibrated to 
local conditions, wherever necessary, as it is a country characterised by complex 
and diverse socio-political and economic conditions.
