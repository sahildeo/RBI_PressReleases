Reserve Bank of India penalizes  
The  Nasik Merchants’ Co-operative Bank Ltd., Nasik, Maharashtra 
 
The Reserve Bank of India has imposed a monetary penalty of `5.00 lakh 
(Rupees Five Lakh Only) on The Nasik Merchants’ Co-operative Bank Ltd., Nasik, 
Maharashtra, in exercise of the powers vested in it under the provisions of Section 
46(4) read with Section 47A(1)(a) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949(As Applicable 
to Co-operative Societies), for violation of instructions/guidelines of the Reserve 
Bank of India. 
 
Inspection of the bank with reference to its position as on March 31, 2012 
revealed that the bank had persistently violated section 6(1) (j) of the banking 
Regulation Act 1949 (AACS) as it had set up a trust in the name and style of 
NAMCO Charitable Trust and the trust had seven Trustees who were also Directors 
of the bank and the purpose of the trust was to run a medical college cum hospital 
for general public. Thus there was evidence of recurrence of violation of section 6(1) 
(j) of the Banking Regulation Act 1949 (AACS) 
 
The Reserve Bank of India had issued a show cause notice to the bank, in 
response to which the bank submitted a written reply. After considering the facts of 
the case and bank’s reply in the matter, the Reserve Bank of India came to the 
conclusion that the violations were substantiated and classified as ‘Major’ which 
warranted imposition of penalty.
