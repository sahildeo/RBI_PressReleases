Framework for setting up of Wholly Owned Subsidiaries by 
 Foreign Banks in India – Taxation matters  
 
 
The Reserve Bank has been receiving queries from foreign banks regarding 
capital gains tax and incidence of Stamp Duty on conversion of existing foreign bank 
branches into wholly owned subsidiaries.  
 
In this context it may be indicated that Government of India has inserted, by 
the Finance Act, 2012, a new Chapter XII-BB titled- ‘Special Provisions relating to 
Conversion of Indian Branch of a Foreign Bank into a Subsidiary Company’ in 
Income Tax Act, 1961, inter alia, exempting capital gains arising from such 
conversion from capital gains tax, with effect from April 1, 2013.  
 
As regards applicability of stamp duty in the case of conversion of existing 
branch of a foreign bank into a wholly owned subsidiary, a new section ‘8E’ has been 
inserted in Indian Stamp Act, 1899 vide Banking Laws (Amendment) Act, 2012 
notified in Gazette of India Notification dated January 18, 2013, exempting from 
stamp duty any conversion of a branch of a foreign bank into wholly owned 
subsidiary or transfer of shareholding of a bank to a holding company in terms of the 
scheme or guidelines of RBI. 
 
Foreign bank desirous of converting their branches into wholly owned 
subsidiaries may take into account the above developments.
