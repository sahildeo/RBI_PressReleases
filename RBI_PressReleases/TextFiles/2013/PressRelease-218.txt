Inflation Indexed National Saving Securities- Cumulative (IINSS-C) 
The Reserve Bank of India, in consultation with Government of India, has 
decided to launch Inflation Indexed National Savings Securities-Cumulative (IINSS-
C) for retail investors in the second half of December 2013.  
 These securities are being launched in the backdrop of announcement made 
in the Union Budget 2013-14 to introduce instruments that will protect savings from 
inflation, especially the savings of the poor and middle classes.  
 The distribution/sale of IINSS-C would be through banks. Interest rate on 
these securities would be linked to final combined Consumer Price Index [CPI (Base: 
2010=100)]. Interest rate would comprise two parts - fixed rate (1.5%) and inflation 
rate based on CPI and the same will be compounded in the principal on half-yearly 
basis and paid at the time of maturity. Early redemptions will be allowed after one 
year from the date of issue for senior citizens (i.e. above 65 years of age) and 3 
years for all others, subject to penalty charges at the rate of 50% of the last coupon 
payable for early redemption. Early redemptions, however, will be made only on 
coupon dates. 
 The date of issuance for subscription would be announced shortly. The details 
of the product design and other operational issues are furnished in the Annex.  The 
issuance of non-cumulative Inflation Indexed National Saving Securities for retail 
investors will be examined in due course.
