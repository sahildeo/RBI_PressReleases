RBI announces Measures to address Market Conditions 
On July 15, 2013, the Reserve Bank of India had announced measures for 
liquidity tightening in order to raise the short-term interest rate and thereby curb 
volatility in the exchange rate. These measures were recalibrated on July 23, 2013. A 
review of these measures suggests that the immediate objective of raising the short-
term interest rates has substantially been achieved as evidenced by the money 
market rates anchoring to the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate of 10.25 per cent. 
Going forward, the Reserve Bank will calibrate the issue of cash management bills 
(CMBs), including scaling it down as may be necessary, to keep the money market 
rates around MSF rate until the volatility of rupee eases. 
It is important to address the risks to macroeconomic stability from external 
sector imbalances. At the same time, it is also important to ensure that the liquidity 
tightening does not harden longer term yields sharply and adversely impact the flow 
of credit to the productive sectors of the economy. It may be recalled that in its first 
quarter monetary policy statement of July 30, 2013, the Reserve Bank had said that 
the stance of its monetary policy is intended, among other things, “to manage liquidity 
conditions to ensure adequate credit flow to the productive sectors of the economy.” 
In pursuance of this objective, it has been decided that: 
• The Reserve Bank will conduct open market purchase operations (OMOs) 
of long dated Government of India Securities of Rs.8,000 crore on August 
23, 2013, and thereafter calibrate them both in terms of quantum and 
frequency, as may be warranted by the evolving market conditions. 
 The hardening of long term yields has resulted in banks incurring large mark-
to-market (MTM) losses in their investment portfolio. Since these MTM losses are 
partly resulting from abnormal market conditions and could be expected to be largely 
recouped going forward, the Reserve Bank has decided to provide the following 
prudential adjustments for a limited period: 
• Current regulations require banks to bring down their statutory liquidity 
ratio (SLR) securities in held to maturity (HTM) category from 25 per cent 
to 23 per cent of their Net Demand and Time Liabilities (NDTL) in a 
progressive manner in a prescribed time frame. The requirement stood at 
24.5 per cent as at end June 2013. It has now been decided to relax this 
requirement by allowing banks to retain SLR holdings in HTM category at 
24.5 per cent until further instructions.

• Further, banks will now be allowed to transfer SLR securities to HTM 
category from available for sale (AFS) / held for trading (HFT) categories 
up to the limit of 24.5 per cent as a one-time measure. Such transfer of 
securities from AFS/HFT category to HTM category should be made at the 
lower of the book value or market value. Banks have the option of valuing 
these securities for the purpose of such transfer as at the close of 
business of July 15, 2013. 
• In addition, banks can spread over the net depreciation, if any, on account 
of MTM valuation of securities held under AFS/HFT categories over the 
remaining period of the current financial year in equal instalments. 
A detailed circular in this regard will be issued shortly.
