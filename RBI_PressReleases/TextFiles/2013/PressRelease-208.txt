RBI releases Draft Report on Implementation of  
Countercyclical Capital Buffer Framework in India  
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) today placed on its website the Draft Report 
of the Internal Working Group (IWG) on Implementation of Countercyclical Capital 
Buffer (CCCB) in India (Chairperson: Shri B. Mahapatra). Comments on the Report 
may please be emailed or forwarded by December 31, 2013 to the Principal Chief 
General Manager, Department of Banking Operations and Development, Reserve 
Bank of India, Central Office, Mumbai-400 001.  
The IWG approached the implementation framework keeping two main issues 
in mind. First, the structural changes that the Indian economy has been going 
through should be considered in calibrating the indicator/s for CCCB imposition; 
secondly, being an emerging economy, the maximum potential growth may not have 
been achieved by it so far and hence CCCB imposition should not stifle the possibility 
of the same.  
The key recommendations of the IWG are:  
• While the credit-to-GDP gap shall be used for empirical analysis to facilitate 
CCCB decision, it may not be the only reference point in the CCCB framework 
for banks in India and the credit-to-GDP gap may be used in conjunction with 
other indicators like Gross Non-Performing Assets (GNPA) growth for CCCB 
decisions in India.  
• The CCCB decision may be pre-announced with a lead time of 4-quarters.  
• The lower threshold (or L) of the CCCB when the buffer is activated may be 
set at 3 percentage points of the credit-to-GDP gap, provided its relationship 
with GNPA remains significant and the upper threshold (or H) may be kept at 
15 percentage points of credit-to-GDP gap.  
• The CCCB shall increase linearly from 0 to 2.5 per cent of the risk weighted 
assets (RWA) of the bank based on the position of gap between 3 percentage 
points and 15 percentage points. However, if the gap exceeds 15 percentage 
points, the buffer shall remain at 2.5 per cent of the RWA. If the gap is below 3 
percentage points then there will not be any CCCB requirement. 
• The supplementary indicators shall include incremental C-D ratio for a moving 
period of three-years (along with its correlation with credit-to-GDP ratio gap 
and GNPA growth), Industry Outlook (IO) assessment index (along with its 
correlation with GNPA growth) and interest coverage ratio (along with its 
correlation with credit-to-GDP gap). In due course, indices like House Price 
Index / RESIDEX and Credit Condition Survey may also form a part of the 
supplementary indicators for CCCB decision.

• The Reserve Bank of India may apply discretion in terms of use of indicators 
while activating or adjusting the buffer. 
• The CCCB framework in India may be operated in conjunction with sectoral 
approach that has been successfully used in India over the period of time. 
• The same set of indicators that are used for activating CCCB may be used to 
arrive at the decision for the release phase of the CCCB. However, instead of 
hard rules-based approach, flexibility in terms of use of judgement and 
discretion may be provided to the Reserve Bank of India for operating the 
release phase of CCCB. Further, the entire CCCB may be released promptly 
at a single point in time. 
• For all banks operating in India, CCCB shall be maintained on solo basis as 
well as on consolidated basis in India.  
• The indicators and thresholds used for CCCB decisions may be subject to 
continuous research and empirical testing for their usefulness and new 
indicators may be explored to support CCCB decisions. 
Background  
 It may be recalled that in the aftermath of the financial crisis in 2008, the Group 
of Central Bank Governors and Heads of Supervision (GHOS) showed commitment 
to introducing Countercyclical Capital Buffer Framework vide its press release dated 
September 7, 2009. Subsequently, in July 2010, the Basel Committee issued a 
consultative Document on Countercyclical Capital Buffer titled ‘Guidance for national 
authorities operating countercyclical capital buffer’.   
 Against this backdrop, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) set up an Internal 
Working Group (IWG) under the Chairmanship of Shri B. Mahapatra, Executive 
Director, RBI, to create a CCCB framework for banks in India. Further, in the second 
quarter review of the Monetary Policy Statement of 2013-14, it was stated that the 
draft report of the IWG would be placed on RBI website by November 30, 2013.
