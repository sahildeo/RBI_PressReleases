RBI Working Paper Series 9: 
Corporate Pricing Power, Inflation and IIP Growth: An Empirical Investigation 
The Reserve Bank of India today placed on its website a Working Paper titled 
“Corporate Pricing Power, Inflation and IIP Growth: An Empirical Investigation” under 
the Reserve Bank of India Working Paper Series* (RBIWPS). The working paper has 
been authored by Shri Angshuman Hait, Shri Joice John, Dr. Abhiman Das and     
Shri Anujit Mitra. 
Pricing power is generally characterised as the degree to which firms pass 
through changes in input costs to prices of finished goods. Previous studies have 
indicated that the degree to which firms pass through both, price increases at 
competing firms and cost increases, depends upon the level of inflation. Further, the 
relationship among corporate pricing power, inflation and output might well be 
affected by other variables, namely, market structure and the level of economic 
activity.  
This paper examines the relationship among pricing power, inflation and 
manufacturing output under a structural vector auto regression (SVAR) framework, 
after controlling the effects of market power and level of economic activity using 
quarterly data for Q1 of 2000-01 to Q3 of 2011-12. The analysis was carried out for 
Non-Food Manufacturing Products (NFMP), various use-based categories and select 
industries.  
  Major findings of this study are: 
• The pricing power has statistically significant, positive and lagged impact on 
output growth for the NFMP group of companies at the aggregate level.  
• The impact of declining pricing power on inflation is found to be positive but 
relatively subdued.  
• The fall in pricing power is reflected sooner in the moderation of output growth 
than on inflation.  
• Among the use-based groups, the impact of pricing power on inflation and 
output growth is significant and positive only in the case of intermediate goods.
