Report on Trend and Progress of Banking in India – 2012-13 
 
The Reserve Bank of India today released the statutory Report on Trend and 
Progress of Banking in India 2012-13. This Report presents the performance and 
salient policy measures relating to the banking sector during 2012-13. The Report 
also provides an analysis of the co-operative banks and non-banking financial 
institutions.  
 
The key messages of the Report are set out below: 
 
Perspectives on the Indian Banking Sector  
• The weakening domestic macroeconomic conditions combined with the 
continuing subdued global growth posed challenges to the banking sector 
during 2012-13. However, the comfortable capital base continues to lend 
resilience to the Indian banking sector (para 1.1, page 1). 
• The regulatory and supervisory policy responses during the year pertained to 
initiatives for implementing risk-based supervision, enhanced oversight of 
financial conglomerates and steps towards improved co-ordination among 
regulators, besides positioning banks to meet the needs of inclusive growth 
(para 1.11-1.17, pages 4-6).  
• Initiatives were undertaken to expand the banking system, increase 
competition, further strengthen the payments and settlement mechanism and 
fortification of capital (para 1.18-1.21, pages 6-7). 
• At the present juncture, the key issues related to the Indian banking sector 
include: 
o effective reduction in NPAs and improvements in the loan recovery 
process;  
o need to achieve sustainable financial inclusion through suitable 
business and delivery models;  
o need to stimulate and foster competition in the banking sector and 
liberalise licensing policies; and 
o need for decisive changes in the present banking structure to enable it 
to grow in size, resources, efficiency and inclusivity (para 1.25-1.28, 
pages 8-9; para 1.33-1.34, page 10).  
 
Global Banking Developments  
 
• Globally, the banks continued their efforts to repair their balance sheets and 
improve their capital ratios, albeit at an uneven pace across countries (para 
2.3, page 12; para 2.12, page 16).  
• The growth in global credit was multi-paced. The return on assets (RoA) 
improved for banks in the US and some emerging market and developing 
economies (EMDEs), but declined in European countries (para 2.4, para 2.6-
2.7, page 12).  
?nullnull???nullnullnull??• Financial conditions in the global banking system improved following 
monetary easing measures by central banks in advanced economies (para 
2.8, page 12).  
• The global regulatory reforms initiated in 2009 to strengthen the financial 
sector and to support sustainable economic growth by reducing future risks  
progressed in many areas such as Basel III framework, systemically important 
financial institutions (SIFI) and financial market infrastructures (para 2.28-
2.35; pages 26-27).  
 
Policy Environment  
 
• Many initiatives were undertaken in the sphere of regulatory and supervisory 
policies during the year. These include issuing guidelines for new bank 
licences, rationalising branch authorisation policy and revision in policy 
regarding restructuring of advances by banks/financial institutions. Also, policy 
framework was released for setting up of wholly owned subsidiaries by foreign 
banks in India (para 3.24-3.29, pages 34-36; para 3.40-41, pages 38-39). 
• Measures were also introduced for rationalisation of bank lending against gold 
and bank finance for purchase of gold. Discussion papers on banking 
structure and dynamic provisioning framework were released and risk-based 
supervisory approach for banks was adopted (para 3.30-3.31, para 3.33-3.34, 
pages 36-37; para 3.48, page 41).  
• Significant headway was made in improving credit delivery channels, credit 
flow towards productive sectors and financial inclusion by revising priority 
sector loan limits and refocusing on credit growth to micro and small 
enterprises. Further, bank licence was issued to Bharatiya Mahila Bank Ltd. to 
address gender related aspects of empowerment (para 3.10, para 3.12-3.13, 
pages 31-32; para 3.18-3.20, page 33). 
 
Operations and Performance of Commercial Banks 
 
• Against the backdrop of a slowdown in the domestic economy and tepid 
global recovery, the growth of the Indian banking sector slowed down for the 
second consecutive year in 2012-13 (para 4.3, page 55). 
• Both balance sheet and off-balance sheet operations of Indian banks slowed 
down in 2012-13. There was a slowdown in credit growth to all productive 
sectors though retail credit remained buoyant (para 4.3, page 55).  
• The lower credit off-take, despite the softening of interest rates, affected the 
profits of SCBs with all major indicators of profitability, viz., return on assets 
(RoA) and return on equity (RoE) showing a decline during the year. New 
private sector banks and foreign banks, however, could improve their RoA 
with the help of reduced operational costs (para 4.13-4.14, pages 60-61). 
• The ratio of NPAs increased further during 2012-13. There was a rise in the 
slippage ratio as well as the ratio of restructured advances to gross advances 
(para 4.19-4.22, pages 65-67).  
• The increased stress in asset quality during the year was primarily on account 
of non-priority sectors. There was a rise in the NPA ratios for the industrial 
and infrastructural sectors (para 4.25, page 68).  
• The capital adequacy positions of SCBs remained above the stipulated norm 
at the aggregate and bank group-levels (para 4.17-4.18, page 65). 
• With the completion of three years of financial inclusion plans, there were 
signs of considerable progress in terms of expanding the outreach of banking 
through both branch and non-branch means. While banking outlets were 
provided in almost all identified unbanked villages with a population of more 
2 
 than 2,000, the process of bringing in unbanked villages with a population of 
less than 2,000 was in progress during the year (para 4.59, page 83).  
 
 
Developments in Co-operative Banking 
 
• Urban Co-operative Banks (UCBs) registered a stable growth in assets during 
2012-13 but there was some moderation in profitability. The asset quality of 
these institutions witnessed sustained improvement (para 5.13, page 95; para 
5.17, page 99).  
• With regard to rural co-operatives, State Co-operative Banks (StCBs) and 
District Central Co-operative Banks (DCCBs) showed improvement in 
profitability and asset quality in 2011-12. The Primary Agricultural Credit 
Societies (PACS) incurred losses outpacing the profitability of StCBs and 
DCCBs during 2011-12 resulting in losses for the short-term co-operative 
credit structure (para 5.25, page 104; para 5.28-5.29, pages 105-106; para 
5.34-5.35, pages 107-108). 
• The long-term rural co-operative credit institutions continued to witness losses 
and also exhibited weak asset quality in 2011-12 (para 5.45-5.46, page 113; 
para 5.49-5.50, page 115).  
 
Non-Banking Financial Institutions 
 
• Financial performance of Financial Institutions (FIs) improved during 2012-13 
in terms of both operating and net profits (para 6.9, page 121). 
• During 2012-13, net profits of Non-Banking Financial Companies - Deposit 
taking (NBFCs-D) and Systemically Important Non-Deposit taking NBFCs 
(NBFCs-ND-SI) showed only marginal improvement (para 6.30, page 130; 
para 6.41, page 135).  
• Profits of Standalone Primary Dealers showed a significant expansion (para 
6.50, page 138). 
• Overall asset quality of a large part of the NBFI sector deteriorated during the 
year, partly reflecting economic slowdown (para 6.52, page 140).  
• With regard to capital adequacy, the entire NBFI sector was comfortably 
placed (para 6.52, page 140).
