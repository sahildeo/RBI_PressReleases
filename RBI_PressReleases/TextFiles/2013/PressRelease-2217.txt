RBI releases Final Report of the Working Group on  
Issues Related to Gold Imports and Gold Loan NBFCs in India    
The Reserve Bank of India has today placed on its website the final Report of 
the Working Group to Study the Issues Related to Gold Imports and Gold Loan 
NBFCs (non-banking finance companies) in India. 
Key Recommendations of the Working Group: 
a. Macro Issues 
? There is a need to moderate the demand for gold imports considering its 
impact on the current account deficit. A combination of demand reduction 
measures, supply management measures and measures to increase 
monetisation of idle stocks of gold need to be put in place. 
i. Demand Reduction Measures: 
? Fiscal measures to reduce the gold imports may be revisited; 
? Better documentation of gold deals and ensuring a better tax treatment of gold 
is important; 
? There is a  need to design innovative financial instruments that can provide 
real returns to investors, i.e., inflation indexed bonds; 
? Need to convert both rural and urban demand for gold into investment in gold-
backed financial instruments through dematerialisation of gold; 
? There is a  need to consider introducing new gold-backed financial products to 
unlock the hidden economic value in the idle gold in the economy; 
? Introduction of products like Gold Accumulation Plan, Gold Linked Account, 
Modified Gold Deposit and Gold Pension Product may be considered; 
? Careful evaluation of  regulatory issues in introducing the proposed gold-
backed products is critical; 
? Differential pricing of banking services and finance for gold imports may be 
considered; 
? Bank finance to purchases of gold bullion may be prohibited; 
? Preferential treatment accorded to gold imports in the procedures, etc., may 
be reviewed; 
????? ??????????????2 
 
? There is no strong case to exempt Metal Gold Loans from the Base Rate 
stipulations; 
ii. Supply Management Measures: 
? There is a need to recycle considerable domestic scrap gold; 
? Banks may continue their role as nominated agencies in gold imports; 
? But, limits on the volume and value of gold to be imported by banks may be 
considered, if required under extreme situation; 
? Consider imposing export obligation on bulk gold importers; 
? Idle gold reserves of gold exchange traded funds (ETFs) may be put to 
productive use; 
? Introduction of tax incentives on instruments that can impound idle gold may 
be considered like introduction of gold bonds;  
? Authorities may consider setting up of a Gold Bank. This institution can pool 
the idle stocks of gold besides undertaking several other functions including 
providing refinance. In this regard,  a Concept Paper on Bullion Corporation of 
India is also enclosed;  
iii. Measures to expand monetisation of gold: 
? Banks may expand their gold jewellery loan portfolio to monetise the stocks of 
idle gold; 
? There should not be any curb or limits on advances against gold jewellery and 
gold coins by individuals; 
b. Institutional and Micro Issues 
? The rapid growth of the assets, borrowings and branch network of gold loan 
NBFCs need to be monitored continuously; 
? Need to reduce the gold loan NBFCs’ heavy borrowings from the banking 
system so as to reduce their interconnectedness with the formal financial 
system gradually; 
? Declining capital adequacy ratio – Need to improve the capital of gold loan 
NBFCs; 
? Need to review the current stipulations pertaining to raising of resources 
through non-convertible debentures (NCDs) by gold loan NBFCs; 
? The exemption available to secured debentures from the definition of “deposit” 
may be reviewed; 
? There is a need for monitoring transactions between gold loan NBFCs and 
unincorporated bodies; 
? Though leverage of the gold loan NBFCs is not a cause for concern at the 
present juncture, going forward, there is a need for improving owned funds of 
the NBFCs; 3 
 
? There is a need to thoroughly review the operational practices followed by 
gold loans NBFCs; 
? There is a need to ensure transparent communication of loan terms by gold 
loans NBFCs; 
? Institution of a customer complaints and grievances redressal system by gold 
loans NBFCs is important; 
? Need to review the auction procedures followed by gold loans NBFCs; 
? Location of auctions should be the same Taluka where the borrower is 
located; 
? Post-auction safeguards should be followed by gold loans NBFCs; 
? Better disclosure standards need to be followed by gold loans NBFCs; 
? Monitoring the implementation of the Fair Practices Code is necessary; 
? Standard documentation to be followed by gold loans NBFCs needs to be 
ensured; 
? Use of PAN Card for large gold loan transactions is advised; 
? Payment through cheque for large gold loan transactions may be tried; 
? As of now, there is no case for conceding level playing field for the gold loan 
NBFCs with the banks; 
? There is a case for reviewing the extant ‘loan to value ratio’; however, a well-
defined and standardised concept of the term ‘value’  is necessary; 
? Unbridled growth of branches by large gold loan NBFCs needs to be 
moderated; 
? There is a need for an ombudsman to address the grievances of gold loan 
borrowers; 
? Rationalisation of interest rate structure by gold loans NBFCs is advised; 
? Some gold loan NBFCs have been raising public deposits surreptitiously 
through unincorporated bodies raising concerns; 
III. Major Findings from Technical Work 
? Gold loans have a causal impact on gold imports substantiating the 
emergence of a liquidity motive for holding gold; 
? International gold prices and exchange rates significantly and positively affect 
the gold price in India; 
? Increase in gold price appears to be a main factor in increasing the gold loans 
outstanding; 
? Increase in gold loans extended by NBFCs and banks does not impact 
significantly the gold price in India; 4 
 
? Going by the past trends, a sharp and sudden drop in gold price by 30 to 40 
per cent is a remote possibility causing financial distress to the gold loan 
NBFCs; 
? The extant loan to value ratio (LTV) ratio should provide a reasonable risk 
cover in case the gold prices fall by 10 per cent; 
? NPAs as per cent of total credit exposure and Capital adequacy of gold loan 
NBFCs are not a cause for concern at present; 
? Banking sector’s existing exposure in the form of their individual gold loans 
appears small and may not have any significant repercussions for the stability 
of the banking sector at present; 
? Gold loan NBFCs are doing a socially useful function and that provides a 
strong rationale for careful regulation of the activities of these NBFCs; 
? The recent slew of regulatory measures taken by the Reserve Bank on the 
functioning of the gold loan NBFCs may be continued to ensure a healthy 
growth of the sector in the medium and long term; 
The Reserve Bank would examine the recommendations of the Working 
Group and take a view. 
Background 
The motivation for the study of gold related issues stemmed from 
macroeconomic issues, namely, impact of large gold imports on external sector 
stability and also domestic financial stability due to strong interconnectedness 
between gold loan NBFCs and the banking system. Large rise in the gold loan 
business, rapid expansion of branch network of gold loan NBFCs in a short span of 
time, quantum jump in bank borrowings by NBFCs raised certain regulatory 
concerns. Accordingly, the Monetary Policy Statement 2012-13 announced on April 
17, 2012, stated that a Working Group to Study the Issues Related to Gold Imports 
and Gold Loan NBFCs in India would be constituted. The Working Group was later 
constituted with Shri K.U.B. Rao, Adviser, Department of Economic and Policy 
Research, Reserve Bank of India as its Chairman. Members for the Working Group 
were drawn from various Reserve Bank departments, such as, Department of 
Economic and Policy Research, Department of Non-Banking Supervision, 
Department of Banking Operations and Development, Department of Statistics and 
Information Management, Department of External Investments and Operations and 
Financial Stability Unit. The draft report of the Working Group was placed on the RBI 
website for public comments on January 2, 2013. After incorporating comments and 
suggestions received from experts, stakeholders and general public, the Working 
Group submitted its final report to the Reserve Bank on January 31, 2013.
