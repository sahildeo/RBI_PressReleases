RBI discusses Challenges to Policy Making and Evolving Role of 
Statistical Analysis at its Seventh Statistics Day Conference 
 
th
The Reserve Bank of India organised the 7 Statistics Day Conference 
on August 30, 2013. The theme of the conference was 'Challenges to Policy 
Making and Evolving Role of Statistical Analysis'. Statistics Day is observed in 
India to commemorate the sterling contribution of Prof. Prasanta Chandra 
Mahalanobis to statistics and the Indian statistical system. 
 
Distinguished statisticians and academicians from India and abroad, 
such as, Prof. Bimal Roy, Director, Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata; Prof. 
Richard Smith, University of Cambridge, UK; Prof. B. L. S. Prakasa Rao, C. R. 
Rao Institute of Mathematics, Statistics and Computer Science, Hyderabad; 
and Prof. Subhashis Ghosal, North Carolina State University, spoke in the 
conference. The conference deliberated upon the role of statistical 
measurement and analysis for dealing with policy challenges, use of survey 
data and recent advances in high-dimensional data analysis. Recent 
initiatives by the Reserve Bank in development of indicators for 
macroeconomic measurement were also presented. 
 
Dr. D. Subbarao, Governor, in his inaugural address, alluded to a host 
of conceptual issues in statistical analysis in the course of policy making and 
dilemmas faced in resolving them during the last five years. In his remarks, he 
raised the following five conceptual issues: (i) Inflation measure for monetary 
policy in India: WPI or CPI? (ii) Potential output, threshold inflation and Taylor 
Rule for monetary policy reaction function; (iii) Neutral interest rate and 
assessment of monetary policy stance; (iv) Equilibrium exchange rate - Why 
no single statistical measure is acceptable as a consensus reference value?, 
and (v) Financial stability and stress indicators - way forward. Through these 
issues, he highlighted the formidable challenges confronting statisticians in a 
world which is becoming increasingly integrated and complex. 
Simultaneously, the demands on statisticians are increasing as policy makers 
are looking towards them for robust and reliable technical analysis to guide 
policy making (http://rbi.org.in/scripts/BS_SpeechesView.aspx?Id=835).  
 
Prof. Bimal Roy, in his keynote address, reminisced the role and 
contributions of the Indian Statistical Institute in the development of Statistics 
and Statistical Systems in India.  He recounted in particular the fundamental 
contributions of internationally acclaimed statisticians of ISI in the fields of 
sample survey, design of experiments, theory of estimation, inference, 
probability and stochastic processes.  He highlighted the role of statistics in 
implementation of data security including algorithm for data encryption. He 
emphasised that internal testing and monitoring of these aspects would be 
critical for the economy, especially for the financial sector.

Prof. Richard Smith presented an econometric framework of using 
qualitative survey data for forecasting of economic activity. Categorical 
responses of the firms were linked with official data through ordered discrete-
choice models and a statistically efficient composite indicator was developed. 
Empirical results based on the proposed indicator showed its relative 
advantage of producing early estimates of output than traditional indicators.  
 
Prof. Prakasa Rao highlighted the recent advances in statistical 
analysis of high-dimensional data, which is characterized by large number of 
parameters as compared to the number of observations. As the classical 
statistical methods are not applicable to analyse such data, alternative 
methods were suggested to model the intrinsic heterogeneity of big and high-
dimensional data.  
 
In spite of the very high complexity of large-dimensional data, a key 
feature that allows valid statistical analysis is its property of sparsity. How to 
use this characteristics in a Bayesian framework was the essence of Prof. 
Ghosal’s talk. From the computational perspectives, he proposed a new 
technique based on Laplace approximation for structure detection and 
demonstrated its usefulness for the analysis of high-dimensional financial 
data. 
 
Dr. Urjit R. Patel, Deputy Governor highlighted three major areas of 
research as (i) development of models for forecasting of macroeconomic 
variables and policy simulation which captures the dynamics and the 
stochastic behaviour of the economic agents; (ii) explore the scope to 
integrate the results of surveys on industrial outlook, inflation expectations, 
consumer confidence and credit conditions in models to enhance their utility 
for policy, and (iii) strengthen our research capabilities for analysing financial 
market data, where the linkage with real sector constitutes an important 
feedback channel.  
 
Earlier, while welcoming the participants, Shri Deepak Mohanty, 
Executive Director, noted that in the Reserve Bank, we treat statistics as a 
public good. It is necessary not only to aid our decision making but also for 
empowerment of citizens. He emphasised the need for harmonisation of data 
definition across various returns submitted to RBI and adoption of straight 
through processing by reporting entities without manual intervention for 
submission of information to maintain data integrity. He also underscored the 
need for enhancing the scope and coverage of corporate finance statistics 
and further development of asset price statistics 
(http://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/BS_SpeechesView.aspx?Id=834). 
 
The deliberations in the conference provide input for crafting the 
agenda of future statistical work in the Reserve Bank.
