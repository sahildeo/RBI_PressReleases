Performance of Private Corporate Business Sector 
during First Half of 2012-13 
 
The Reserve Bank of India today released, on its website, the data related to 
Performance of Private Corporate Business Sector during First Half of 2012-13.  
The data compiled are based on abridged financial results of 2,832 listed non-
government non-financial (NGNF) Companies and provide details regarding the 
performance of private corporate sector during first half (H1) of 2012-13. Data 
pertaining to two quarters (Q1 and Q2 of 2012-13) for the same period covering 2,790 
and 2,749 companies, respectively, are also included and so is the performance of 
390 financial companies for first half of 2012-2013. ‘Explanatory Notes’ containing, in 
brief, the methodology followed for compilation of data and the ‘Glossary of Terms’ are 
given at the end. 
Highlights: 
1. Sales growth (Y-o-Y) further moderated in H1:2012-13. The moderation was 
deeper in the second quarter than in the first. In H1, sales contracted for 
smaller companies with annualised sales below `1 billion. 
2. The Y-o-Y growth in operating profit (EBITDA) in H1:2012-13 was also lower as 
compared with H1: 2011-12. The contraction in profits observed in the first 
quarter, however, reversed in the second.  
3. IT sector performed better compared to the manufacturing and non-IT services 
sector, maintaining its net profit margin at above 17 per cent in H1:2012-13. 
Corresponding net profit margins for manufacturing and non-IT services sectors 
were 5.7 and 4.9 per cent, respectively. 
4. Smaller companies (sales up to ` 1 billion) incurred losses in H1:2012-13, 
though larger companies recorded a higher rise in net profits. Net profit margin, 
in aggregate, was impacted by the poor performance of smaller companies.  
An article analysing the aggregate performance of these companies and capturing 
the evolving trend in their sales, expenditure and profit margin over a longer time 
horizon is being published in the January 2013 issue of the RBI Bulletin.
