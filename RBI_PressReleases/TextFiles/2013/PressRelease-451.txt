Macroeconomic and Monetary Developments, 
Second Quarter Review 2013-14 
The Reserve Bank of India today released the Macroeconomic and Monetary 
Developments, Second Quarter Review 2013-14. The document serves as a 
backdrop to the Second Quarter Review of Monetary of Policy 2013-14 to be 
announced on October 29, 2013. Highlights: 
Growth 
• Modest improvement in growth is expected in the second half (H2) of 2013-14 
following a rebound in agriculture and an improvement in exports. However, a 
fuller recovery is likely to start taking shape towards the end of the fiscal year 
on the back of current steps to clear impediments that were stalling projects. 
• With deceleration in private consumption and fall in investment, overall 
demand conditions remain weak. However, a good monsoon and pick-up in 
exports, if sustained, could provide some momentum. At this stage, demand 
management requires balancing fiscal consolidation with investment support. 
Inflation 
• WPI inflation is ruling above the Reserve Bank’s comfort level and may remain 
range-bound around the current level during H2 of 2013-14. Moreover, the 
persistence of high CPI inflation remains a concern. 
• The good monsoon should have a salutary effect on food inflation, but second-
round effects from already high food and fuel inflation could impart upside 
pressures on prices of other commodities and services. 
Other macro-aspects 
• External sector risks have reduced as CAD is likely to moderate since Q2 of 
2013-14. The trade balance has responded to the policy measures taken; 
exports have picked up and gold imports have declined.  
• Broad money growth is largely in line with the Reserve Bank’s indicative 
trajectory and credit growth has accelerated with greater recourse to bank 
finance by corporates. While financial markets have rallied, near-term 
uncertainties on account of 'tapering' continue to be a concern. 
Overall Outlook 
• Monetary policy faces an unenviable task of anchoring inflation expectations, 
amid tepid growth and weak business confidence. It is, therefore, important to 
craft policy responses so that growth concerns are addressed in an 
environment of stable prices. 
?nullnull???nullnullnull??2 
 
• With the normalisation of exceptional liquidity measures under way, 
incremental calibration of monetary policy will be shaped by changes in the 
growth-inflation balance, keeping overall macroeconomic stability in 
consideration. For supporting growth, complementary action aimed at 
productivity enhancement, structural reforms and quick project implementation 
will be needed.
