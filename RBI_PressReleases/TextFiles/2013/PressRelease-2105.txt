RBI places Rupee Co-operative Bank, Maharashtra  under Directions  
     The Reserve Bank of India has placed Rupee Co-operative bank Ltd., Dist. 
Pune, Maharashtra, under Directions. According to the Directions, depositors will be 
allowed to withdraw  a sum not exceeding `1000/- (Rupees one thousand only) of the 
total balance held in every savings bank or current account or any other deposit 
account by whatever name called, subject to conditions stipulated in the RBI 
Directions. Rupee Co-operative Bank will, without prior approval in writing from the 
Reserve Bank, also not be able to grant or renew any loans and advances, make any 
investment, incur any liability including borrowal of funds and acceptance of fresh 
deposits, disburse or agree to disburse any payment whether in discharge of its 
liabilities and obligations or otherwise, enter into any compromise or arrangement 
and sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its properties or assets except as 
notified in the RBI Directions dated February 21, 2013. The Directions have been 
issued from the close of business on February 22, 2013. 
The Reserve Bank has, however, clarified, that issue of the Directions by the 
Reserve Bank should not per se be construed as cancellation of banking licence. 
Rather, Rupee Cooperative Bank will continue to undertake banking business but 
with restrictions till its financial position improves. The Reserve Bank may consider 
modifications of these Directions depending upon circumstances.  
The Reserve Bank has issued these Directions in exercise of powers vested in 
it under sub section (1) of Section 35A of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (As 
Applicable to Co-operative Societies) read with Section 56 of the Banking Regulation 
Act, 1949.
