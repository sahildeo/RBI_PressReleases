RBI Announces Measures to Improve Liquidity Conditions 
Starting with the Mid-Quarter Review of September 2013, the Reserve Bank of India 
(RBI) began a calibrated withdrawal of exceptional measures undertaken since July 
2013. This was done with a view to normalising liquidity conditions. Accordingly, the 
marginal standing facility (MSF) rate was reduced by 75 basis points from 10.25 per 
cent to 9.5 per cent. Furthermore, open market purchase operations of Rs. 9,974 
crore were conducted today to inject liquidity into the system. On a review of 
evolving liquidity conditions and in continuation of this calibrated unwinding, it has 
been decided to:  
(a) Reduce the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate by a further 50 basis points 
from 9.5 per cent to 9.0 per cent with immediate effect.  
 
(b) Provide additional liquidity through term repos of 7-day and 14-day tenor for a 
notified amount equivalent to 0.25 per cent of net demand and time liabilities 
(NDTL) of the banking system through variable rate auctions on every Friday 
beginning October 11, 2013. The notified amount and tenor of the term repo 
auctions will be announced prior to the dates of the auctions.  
 
Detailed guidelines regarding term repos are being issued separately.
