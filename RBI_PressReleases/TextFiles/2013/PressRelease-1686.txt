RBI Committee suggests GIRO based Indian Bill Payment System 
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has today released the report of the 
committee set up to study the feasibility of implementation of GIRO based payment 
systems in India (Chairman, Shri G. Padmanabhan). The committee has highlighted 
the need for developing an electronic bill payment system based on a GIRO model 
for payment of dues of essential services, insurance premia, utility payments, taxes, 
university fees, examination fees, school fees, etc. This model will enable the setting 
up of a centralised infrastructure bringing all the billers and banks to the bill platform 
through the aggregators. It will also allow interoperability in the bill payment process 
and enable the consumers to make payments at any of the collection points which is 
the essence of GIRO system.  
The  committee has made major recommendations pertaining to a) setting up 
of the Indian Bill Payment System (IBPS) which would be the centralised 
infrastructure connecting the billers through the aggregators and the customers 
through the customer service points, for management of all  bill payments; b) 
Extending the IBPS value chain of banks/non-banks/billers/aggregators, etc.; c) Bill 
data codification and presentment; d) process of settlement; e) Roles and 
responsibilities of stakeholders; and f) Customer support  and redressal mechanism.  
GIRO payment is a credit push transaction initiated by the payer and may 
involve the presence of three banks (collecting bank, payer bank and the payee 
bank). Bill paying public/customers can access any payment channel through 
banks/non-bank entity under the proposed GIRO system.  
Background 
It may be mentioned that the Reserve Bank of India, has been constantly 
endeavouring to ensure that the payment and settlement systems in the country are 
safe, secure, efficient, inter operable, inclusive and well regulated.  It has also taken 
measures to widen the reach of payment services in the country through both, 
banking and non-banking channels.  Exploring the feasibility of implementation of 
GIRO based payment system in India, is part of the ongoing efforts of the Reserve 
Bank in improving payment and settlement systems in India as laid out in its Payment 
Systems vision (2012-15). At the Second Quarter Review of Monetary Policy 2012-
13, the Governor had announced the setting up of a committee to finalise the 
modalities of implementing the GIRO payment system –both electronic and cheque 
based in India. Accordingly a committee under the chairmanship of Shri G. 
Padmanabhan, Executive Director, RBI was set up.
