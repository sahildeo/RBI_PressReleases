Mid-Quarter Monetary Policy Review: September 2013 
Monetary and Liquidity Measures 
 
 On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic 
situation, it has been decided to: 
? reduce the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate by 75 basis points from 10.25 
per cent to 9.5 per cent with immediate effect;   
? reduce the minimum daily maintenance of the cash reserve ratio (CRR) from 
99 per cent of the requirement to 95 per cent effective from the fortnight 
beginning September 21, 2013, while keeping the CRR unchanged at 4.0 per 
cent; and   
? increase the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) by 25 
basis points from 7.25 per cent to 7.5 per cent with immediate effect.  
Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF stands adjusted to 6.5 per cent 
and the Bank Rate stands reduced to 9.5 per cent with immediate effect. With these 
changes, the MSF rate and the Bank Rate are recalibrated to 200 basis points above 
the repo rate. 
Assessment 
2. Since the First Quarter Review (FQR) in July, a weak recovery has been 
taking hold in advanced economies, with growth picking up in Japan and the UK and 
the euro area exiting recession. However, activity has slowed in several emerging 
economies, buffeted by heightened financial market turbulence on the prospect of 
tapering of quantitative easing (QE) in the US. The decision by the US Federal 
Reserve to hold off tapering has buoyed financial markets but tapering is inevitable.  
3. On the domestic front, growth has weakened with continuing sluggishness in 
industrial activity and services. The pace of infrastructure project completion is 
subdued and new project starts remain muted. Consumption, while relatively firm so 
far, is starting to weaken even in rural areas, with durable goods consumption hit 
hard. Consequently, growth is trailing below potential and the output gap is widening. 
Some pick-up is expected on account of the brightening prospects for agriculture due 
to kharif output and the upturn in exports. Also, as infrastructure investments are 
expedited, and as projects cleared by the Cabinet Committee on Investment come on 
stream, growth could pick up in the second half of the year. 
4. WPI inflation, which had eased in Q1 of 2013-14, has started rising again as 
the pass-through of fuel price increases has been compounded by the sharp 
depreciation of the rupee and rising international commodity prices. The negative 
output gap will exercise downward pressure on inflation, and the process will be 
aided as supply side constraints, especially relating to food and infrastructure, ease. 
However, the current assessment is that in the absence of an appropriate policy 
response, WPI inflation will be higher than initially projected over the rest of the year. 
????? ??????????????What is equally worrisome is that inflation at the retail level, measured by the CPI, 
has been high for a number of years, entrenching inflation expectations at elevated 
levels and eroding consumer and business confidence. Although better prospects of 
a robust kharif harvest will lead to some moderation in CPI inflation, there is no room 
for complacency.  
5. Turning to the external sector, weakening domestic saving, subdued export 
demand and the rising value of oil imports - most recently due to geopolitical risks 
emanating from the Middle East - have led to a larger current account deficit (CAD). 
Concerns about funding the CAD, amplified by capital outflows precipitated by 
anticipated tapering of asset purchases by the US Federal Reserve, increased 
volatility in the foreign exchange market. More recently, as these concerns have been 
mitigated after steps taken by the Government and the Reserve Bank to contain the 
CAD and improve the environment for external financing, the focus has turned to 
internal determinants of the value of the rupee, primarily the fiscal deficit and 
domestic inflation. 
Policy Stance and Rationale 
6. Since mid-July, the Reserve Bank has put in place a number of exceptional 
measures to tighten liquidity with a view to dampening volatility in the foreign 
exchange market. These measures have raised the effective policy rate for monetary 
policy operations to 10.25 per cent, aligned to the re-calibrated MSF rate. The intent 
has been to maintain tight liquidity conditions at the short end of the term structure 
until the measures designed to alter the path of the CAD and improve prospects for 
its stable funding take effect. As a number of these measures are now in place and 
because the external environment has improved, it is now possible for the Reserve 
Bank to contemplate easing these exceptional measures in a calibrated manner. As a 
first step, therefore, the MSF rate is reduced by 75 basis points. Furthermore, the 
minimum daily maintenance of the CRR prescribed by the Reserve Bank is brought 
down from 99 per cent of the requirement to 95 per cent. The timing and direction of 
further actions on exceptional measures will be contingent upon exchange market 
stability, and can be two-way. Further actions need not be announced only on policy 
dates. However, any further change in the minimum daily maintenance of the CRR is 
not contemplated.  
7. As the measures are unwound, the objective is to normalise the conduct and 
operations of monetary policy so as to allow the LAF repo rate to resume its role as 
the operational policy interest rate. However, inflation is high and household financial 
saving is lower than desirable. As the inflationary consequences of exchange rate 
depreciation and hitherto suppressed inflation play out, they will offset some of the 
disinflationary effects of a better harvest and the negative output gap. The need to 
anchor inflation and inflation expectations has to be set against the fragile state of the 
industrial sector and urban demand. Keeping all this in view, bringing down inflation 
to more tolerable levels warrants raising the LAF repo rate by 25 basis points 
immediately.  
8. The Reserve Bank will closely and continuously monitor the evolving growth-
inflation dynamics with a readiness to act pre-emptively, as necessary. The policy 
stance and measures set out in this review begin the process of cautious unwinding 
of the exceptional measures, which will restore normalcy to financial flows. They are 
also intended to address inflationary pressures so as to provide a stable nominal 
anchor for the economy, thereby mitigating exchange market pressures and creating 
a conducive environment for the revitalisation of sustainable growth.
