Lower Barriers to make Banking Accessible: RBI Governor tells Bankers 
Earlier, on August 7, 2013, a special State Level Bankers' Committee meeting 
was convened. Senior officials of the State Government led by the Chief Secretary, 
Government of Maharashtra, Chairmen and Managing Directors of leading public and 
private sector banks in Maharashtra and National Bank for Agriculture and Rural 
Development, as also, senior officials of the Reserve Bank attended the meeting. 
Several issues, such as, meaningful financial inclusion, seeding of bank accounts with 
Aadhaar numbers to facilitate direct benefit transfer (DBT), training of banking 
correspondents, especially in districts identified for DBT, were discussed. While 
concluding the discussion on financial inclusion, Governor Dr. D. Subbarao observed 
that people generally found banking to be beyond their reach. Banks should, therefore, 
consciously endeavour to lower the barriers to make banking accessible to them.  
The State Government officials were sensitised about entities conducting 
unauthorised financial business with people falling prey to their promises of high returns 
and then the entities vanishing with hard earned monies. There were entities which were 
not registering with the Reserve Bank and other financial regulators. It was mentioned 
that surveillance of such unlawful activities by the State Government with its wide reach, 
was necessary over these entities to protect investors' interest.
