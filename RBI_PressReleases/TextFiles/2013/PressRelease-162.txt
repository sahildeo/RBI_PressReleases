2 Meeting of SAARC Public Debt Managers’ Forum  
 
The Reserve Bank of India, in collaboration with the South Asian Association for 
Regional Co-operation (SAARC) Secretariat, organized the second meeting of the 
SAARC Debt Managers’ Forum at Jaipur on December 6 & 7, 2013. The SAARC Debt 
Managers’ Forum serves as a platform for senior government debt mangers from the 
member countries to exchange their views, experiences and policies in the field of public 
debt management including best practices, techniques, strategies, operations and 
statistics. Governor, Deputy Governors and Senior Officials of the Central Banks and the 
Ministries of Finance of SAARC member countries attended the meeting. 
   
Mr. R. Gandhi, Executive Director, Reserve Bank of India welcomed the 
participants and highlighted the importance of the Forum as also the context of choosing 
the theme as “Sovereign Debt Management in Emerging Markets”. He also highlighted 
the importance of macro-economic development, the strategies for debt management in 
varying market conditions and debt market infrastructure in Emerging Market and 
Developing Economies (EMDEs) particularly, in SAARC countries. In his key note 
address, Mr. Harun R. Khan, Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India, observed the 
growing inter-connectedness with the global economy, the challenges posed to policy 
making for EMDEs in debt management area and the way forward to manage the 
uncertainties that emerge by an inter-connected world.  He highlighted the challenges 
faced by debt managers as greater integration of EMDEs in international capital markets 
would transmit the contagion to the domestic debt markets very fast. Further, strong 
capital inflows may expand the demand for Government debt but such flows also pose 
the sudden-stop risk. He underlined the challenge faced by policy makers to maintain a 
fine balance between various objectives, viz. debt sustainability, price stability, financial 
stability and steady growth and termed this challenge as new “Quadrilemma”.  
   
The debt managers from SAARC countries shared their country practices, 
polices, latest developments in debt management, market infrastructure, institutional 
mechanism, etc.  The experts in the debt management field drawn from international and 
domestic institutions, such as, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the 
International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, Clearing Corporation of India Ltd. 
(CCIL), and Morgan Stanley addressed the three technical sessions covering topics, viz. 
Public Debt Management and Macroeconomic Stability, Global Developments and its 
Impact on Public Debt Management of  Small Emerging Market Economies, Public Debt 
Management Strategies and its relevance to SAARC countries,  Market Infrastructure in 
G-Sec market and Product innovations and issues and challenges for floatation of  
Sovereign Foreign Currency bonds. As the meeting of the Forum provided some very 
useful lessons and takeaways for the SAARC member countries in the area of public 
debt management, members resolved to continue such structured interactions on 
ongoing basis.
