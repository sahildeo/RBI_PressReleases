December 4, 2013 
th
RBI launches the 34 Round of Inflation Expectations Survey of Households 
The Reserve Bank of India has been conducting Inflation Expectations Survey 
th
of Households (IESH) on a quarterly basis since September 2005. The 34 round of 
the Survey with October-December 2013 as the current reference period has been 
launched today. The Survey seeks qualitative responses from households on price 
changes (general prices as well as prices of specific product groups) in the next three 
months as well as in the next one year and quantitative responses on current, three-
month ahead and one-year ahead inflation rates. The results of this Survey are being 
used by Reserve Bank as one of the important inputs to the monetary policy 
formulation.   
Inflation expectations are subjective assessments of around 5,000 households 
across 16 cities proposed to be covered in the Survey round and are based on 
households’ individual consumption baskets.  
The agency M/s Hansa Research Group Pvt. Ltd., Mumbai has been engaged 
to conduct this round of the Survey on behalf of the Reserve Bank of India. For this 
purpose, the households will be approached by the agency during the quarter and 
the selected households are requested to provide their response. Other individuals 
that are not approached by the agency can also participate in this survey round by 
downloading the survey schedule from the RBI Website (Forms-Survey). The filled in 
survey schedule may be e-mailed to us as per contact details given below. In case of 
any query/clarification, kindly contact at the following address:
