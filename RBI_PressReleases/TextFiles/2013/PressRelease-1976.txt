 Pay IT dues in advance at RBI or at authorised bank branches 
 
 The Reserve Bank of India has appealed to income tax assessees to remit 
their income tax dues sufficiently in advance of the due date. It has also stated that 
assessees can use alternate channels like select branches of agency banks or the 
facility of online payment of taxes offered by these banks. These will obviate the 
inconvenience involved in standing in long queues at the Reserve Bank offices.   
 
 It is observed that the rush for remitting Income –Tax dues through the 
Reserve Bank of India has been far too heavy towards the end of March every year 
and it becomes difficult for the Reserve Bank to cope with the pressure of issuing 
receipts although additional counters to the maximum extent possible are provided 
for the purpose.   
 
 Twenty-nine agency banks are authorised to accept payments of Income Tax 
dues.  These are: 
 
1. Allahabad Bank 16. Syndicate Bank 
2. Andhra Bank 17. UCO Bank 
3. Bank of Baroda 18. Union Bank of India 
4. Bank of India 19. United Bank of India 
5.  Bank of Maharashtra 20. Vijaya Bank 
6.  Canara Bank 21. State Bank of India 
7.  Central Bank of India  22. State Bank of Bikaner & Jaipur 
8. Corporation Bank 23. State Bank of Hyderabad 
9. Dena Bank 24. State Bank of Travancore 
10.  IDBI Bank 25. State Bank of Mysore  
11.  Indian Bank  26. State Bank of Patiala 
12.  Indian Overseas Bank 27. HDFC Bank 
13. Oriental Bank of Commerce 28. Axis Bank 
14. Punjab & Sindh Bank  29. ICICI Bank
