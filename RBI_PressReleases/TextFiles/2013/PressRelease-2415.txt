RBI releases Draft Report of its Working Group on Gold 
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) today placed on its website, the Draft Report 
of the Working Group to Study the Issues Related to Gold and Gold Loans by Non-
Banking Finance Companies (NBFCs) in India (Chairman: Shri K.U.B.Rao, Adviser, 
Department of Economic and Policy Research). The Reserve Bank has sought 
comments on the draft report from stakeholders and public. The comments may be 
mailed up to Friday, January 18, 2013.  
The Working Group was assigned with the task of studying whether large gold 
imports of India are a threat to external stability. The Working Group was also asked, 
among other things, to study the recent trends in gold loans extended by large gold 
loan NBFCs and see whether there are any systemic stability issues that arise out of 
the interconnectedness between banks and gold loans NBFCs. The Working Group 
followed an eclectic approach to address the terms of reference assigned by 
undertaking technical exercises to study the relationship among various related 
economic variables; and to conduct surveys through intense dialogue with all the 
stakeholders to firm up related views. Existing regulations related to NBFCs-Non-
Deposit taking (ND) - Systemically Important (SI) sector were reviewed and 
recommendations were offered.  
Gist of the Working Group’s Report: 
Macro Issues 
Large gold imports are adversely impacting the current account deficit. There 
is a need to moderate the demand for gold imports, as ensuring external sector’s 
stability is critical. It is necessary to recognise that demand for gold in India is not 
strictly amenable to policy changes and also is price inelastic due to varied reasons. 
Banks’ role in canalising gold imports is important, but has been declining over the 
years. There is scope for reviewing the current incentives available for banks to deal 
with gold imports. In the context of growing demand for gold, it is critical to ensure 
real returns to investors through various financial savings products, so that their 
attention can be diverted away from gold, at least, partly. There is a need for banks 
to introduce new gold-backed financial products that may reduce or postpone the 
demand for gold imports. Investors’ awareness and education is important in the 
context of channelising the investment to gold-backed financial products. The 
Working Group believes that providing real rate of return to investors through 
alternative instruments holds the key to reducing the excessive demand for gold. 
Meanwhile, there is also a need to increase monetisation of idle gold stocks in the 
economy for productive purposes. Encouraging loans against the collateral of gold 
for productive purposes may be a way to do this.

Micro Issues 
The financial performance of the gold loans NBFCs and the current level of 
their borrowings from the banking system are not of significant concern. There 
appears to be no immediate systemic implications in terms of domestic financial 
stability due to the interconnectedness of gold loans NBFCs and banking system. 
Banks and NBFCs may continue to deliver gold jewellery loans, which monetise the 
idle gold in the country. The gold loan market has grown well in recent years. It is 
time for consolidation of the operations of the gold loan NBFCs. The gold loan 
NBFCs need to transform themselves into institutions free of complaints, have proper 
documentation and auction procedures, with rationalised interest rate structure and 
have a branch network that is fully safe and secure.  
Key Recommendations 
Key recommendations of the Working Group are:  
• There is a need to moderate the demand for gold imports considering its 
impact on the current account deficit 
• Fiscal measures to reduce the gold imports may be revisited 
• Banks need to design innovative financial instruments that can provide real 
returns to investors 
• Need to convert both rural and urban demand for gold into investment in gold-
backed  financial instruments through dematerialisation of gold 
• Introduction of tax incentives on instruments that can impound idle gold may 
be considered 
• There is a need to recycling of domestic scrap gold    
• Limits on the volume and value of gold to be imported by banks may be 
considered, if required under extreme situation  
• Consider imposing export obligation on bulk gold importers 
• Banks may expand their gold jewellery loan portfolio to monetise the stocks of 
idle gold 
• The debate on setting up of a gold bank may be revisited 
• Banks may continue their role as nominated agencies in gold imports  
• Differential pricing of banking services and finance for gold imports may be 
considered 
• Bank finance to purchases of gold bullion may be prohibited 
• There should not be any curb or limits on advances against gold jewellery and 
gold coins by individuals 
• Banks may continue retailing of  gold coins, given their small volume 
• There is no strong case to exempt Metal Gold Loans from the base rate 
stipulations 
• There is an imperative need to consider introducing new gold-backed financial 
products to unlock the hidden economic value in the idle gold in the economy 
• Products like Gold Accumulation Plan, Gold Linked Account, modified Gold 
Deposit and Gold Pension Product may be considered for introduction  
• Careful evaluation of each of the proposed gold-backed product is critical 
• The rapid growth of the assets, borrowings and branch network of gold loan 
NBFCs need to be monitored continuously 3 
 
• Need to reduce the interconnectedness of gold loan NBFCs with the formal 
financial system gradually  
• Declining capital adequacy ratio – Need to improve the capital of gold loan 
NBFCs 
• Need to review the current stipulations pertaining to raising of resources 
through NCDs by gold loan NBFCs 
• The exemption available to secured debentures from the definition of “deposit” 
may be reviewed 
• There is a need for monitoring transactions between gold loan NBFCs and 
unincorporated bodies 
• Though leverage of the gold loan NBFCs is not a cause for concern at the 
present juncture, going forward, there is a need for improving owned funds of 
the NBFCs 
• There is a need to thoroughly review the operational practices followed by 
gold loans NBFCs 
• There is a need to ensure transparent communication of loan terms by gold 
loans NBFCs 
• Institution of a customer complaints and grievances redressal system by gold 
loans NBFCs is important 
• Need to review the auction procedure by gold loans NBFCs 
• Location of auctions should be same Taluka where the borrower is located  
• Post-auction safeguards to be followed by gold loans NBFCs 
• Better disclosure standards to be followed by  gold loans NBFCs 
• Monitoring the implementation of the Fair Practices Code  
• Standard documentation to be followed by gold loans NBFCs 
• Use of PAN Card for large gold loan transactions 
• Payment through cheque for large gold loan transactions 
• As of now, there is no case for conceding level playing field for the gold loan 
NBFCs with the banks  
• There is a case for review of the extant ‘loan to value ratio’ 
• There is need for a clearly-defined and standardised concept of the term 
‘Value’ for prescribing appropriate ‘Loan to Value Ratio’  
• Unbridled growth of branches by large gold loan NBFCs needs to be 
moderated 
• There is a need for an ombudsman to address the grievances of gold loan 
borrowers 
• Rationalisation of interest rate structure by gold loans NBFCs 
Major Conclusions 
• Gold loans have a causal impact on gold imports substantiating the 
emergence of a liquidity motive for holding gold 
• International gold prices and exchange rate significantly and positively affect 
the gold prices in India 
• Increase in gold prices appears to be one factor that increase the gold loans 
outstanding 4 
 
• Increase in gold loans extended by NBFCs and banks does not impact 
significantly the gold prices in India 
• On the basis of empirical analysis of volatility in gold price, it is difficult to 
estimate future prices of gold  
• Going by the past trends, a sharp sudden drop in gold price by 30 to 40 per 
cent is a remote possibility causing financial distress to the gold loan NBFCs 
• The extant loan to value ratio (LTV) ratio should provide a reasonable risk 
cover in case the gold prices fall by 10 per cent  
• Asset quality, NPAs as per cent of total credit exposure and Capital adequacy 
of gold loan NBFCs are not a cause for concern at present 
• The sources of funds of gold loan NBFCs do not appear to be an immediate 
cause of concern giving rise to concentration credit risk 
• The striking growth of gold loan NBFCs business warrant that their operations 
may be closely monitored  
• Some gold loan NBFCs have been raising public deposits surreptitiously 
through unincorporated bodies raising concerns 
• Banking sector’s existing exposure in the form of their individual gold loans 
appears small and may not have any significant repercussions for the stability 
of the banking sector at present 
• Probability of volatility in gold prices impacting the gold loan market is low 
• Gold loans NBFCs are subjected to prudential regulations and reporting 
requirements  
• Gold loans NBFCs are doing a socially useful function and that provides a 
strong rationale for a careful regulation of the activities of these NBFCs 
• The recent slew of regulatory measures taken by RBI on the functioning of the 
gold loan NBFCs may be continued to ensure a healthy growth of the sector in 
the medium and long term 
Background 
It may be recalled that in the Monetary Policy Statement 2012-13 announced 
on April 17, 2012, the constitution a Working Group to study the gold loan market in 
India, which has shown rapid strides in recent years. The large rise in the gold loan 
business, the branch network of gold loan NBFCs, volume of loans disbursed and the 
quantum of bank borrowings raised certain regulatory concerns. There were also 
macroeconomic issues like impact of large gold imports on external sector stability. 
Accordingly, a Working Group was constituted under the Chairmanship of              
Shri K.U.B.Rao, Adviser, Department of Economic and Policy Research, RBI. The 
Working Group had internal members from various departments like Department of 
Economic Policy and Research, Department of Non-Banking Supervision, 
Department of Banking Operations & Development, Department of Statistics and 
Information Management and Financial Stability Unit. This Draft Report has taken 
into account comments received internally from Financial Markets Committee 
Members and the comments from FSDC Sub-Committee Members.
