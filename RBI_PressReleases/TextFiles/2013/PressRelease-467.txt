RBI Working Paper Series 10:  
Net Interest Margin, Financial Crisis and Bank Behavior:  
Experience of Indian Banks 
The Reserve Bank of India today placed on its website a Working Paper titled 
“Net Interest Margin, Financial Crisis and Bank Behavior: Experience of Indian 
Banks” under the Reserve Bank of India Working Paper Series* (RBIWPS). The 
paper has been authored by Shri Tushar B. Das. 
In this paper, the author has attempted to assess the impact of the financial 
crisis on banks’ efficiency considering Net Interest Margin (NIM) as an efficiency 
indicator for the Indian banks. By employing disaggregated bank level data across 
different ownership categories, the author has analysed the factors influencing Indian 
banks’ margin. Following the monetary transmission literature, the author has also 
investigated the influence of size, liquidity and capitalisation on the efficiency of 
banks.           
Major findings: 
• Bank margins dampened during 1992 to 2010 due to non-performing assets 
(NPAs) and cost inefficiency. 
• Real economic growth influenced the margin in a positive way. 
• Well capitalised banks and banks with high deposits concentration could 
maintain high margin and withstand the impact of crisis.  
• Public Sector Banks faced significant erosion of their profitability. 
• Banks with high capital and adequate liquidity did not come under pressure 
during the initial part of the crisis. 
• During the second half of the crisis, banks with low capital and limited liquidity 
found it difficult to maintain the margin. 
*The Reserve Bank of India introduced the RBI Working Papers series in March
