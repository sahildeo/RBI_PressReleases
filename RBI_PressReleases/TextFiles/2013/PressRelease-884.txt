Dr. D. Subbarao, Governor, RBI appealed to the banks  
to reach out in Hindi and other vernacular languages for 
 meaningful Financial Inclusion and Financial Literacy 
 
"Financial inclusion and financial literacy are priority programmes for the 
Reserve Bank. I am happy to note that banks have been implementing these 
initiatives with enthusiasm, vigour and imagination. One lesson of experience in this 
regard has been that we cannot meaningfully pursue financial inclusion and financial 
literacy by using English as the medium of communication. We necessarily have to 
reach out in Hindi and other vernacular languages." 
Dr. D. Subbarao, Governor, Reserve Bank of India appealed to the banks 
today at Mumbai while awarding the Rajbhasha Shields for the year 2011-2012. 
He also told that over the last few months, there has been growing incidence 
of unlawful, fraudulent schemes which have lured gullible people into making 
deposits by promising high returns. When these schemes fail, as most of them do, 
poor households lose their entire life savings. It is the responsibility of the 
Governments and regulators to protect people from such fraudulent schemes. We 
need to do two things to achieve that. First, we should make people better aware of 
the risks of such schemes. Second, we need to provide them access to the formal 
financial sector so that they do not fall prey to such schemes. For both these 
initiatives, we need to reach out in Hindi and vernacular languages. The Government 
and the Reserve Bank have accordingly launched an advertisement campaign on 
local languages to increase awareness among people. We need banks to join in this 
initiative.  
On this occasion Dr. Urjit Patel, Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India while 
complimenting the prize winning banks and financial institutions said that as a service 
industry banks should communicate with the public in their language. The importance 
of Hindi increases as Hindi is the most understood and spoken language of our 
country. Hence the banks should use Hindi to communicate with the public. 
Shri R. Gandhi, Executive Director welcomed the Chief Executives of banks 
and financial institutions and Shri U.S.Paliwal, Principle Chief General Manager, 
Human Resource Management Department proposed a vote of thanks.                   
Dr. Ramakant Gupta, General Manager, Rajbhasha Department, Reserve Bank of 
India conducted the programme. 
The function was attended by chairmen and other senior executives of banks 
and financial institutions.
