RBI to open a Swap Window to attract FCNR(B) Dollar Funds 
 
The Reserve Bank of India has been receiving requests from banks to 
consider a special concessional window for swapping foreign currency non-resident 
(banks) {FCNR(B)} deposits that will be mobilised as per the recent relaxations 
permitted by the Reserve Bank of India. It has been decided accordingly to offer 
such a window to the banks to swap the fresh FCNR (B) dollar funds, mobilised for a 
minimum tenor of three years and over at a fixed rate of 3.5 per cent per annum for 
the tenor of the deposit.  
 
Further, based on requests received from banks, it has also been decided that 
the current overseas borrowing limit of 50 per cent of the unimpaired Tier I capital 
may be raised to 100 per cent and that the borrowings mobilised under this provision 
can be swapped with Reserve Bank of India at the option of the Bank at a 
concessional rate of 100 basis points below the ongoing swap rate prevailing in the 
market. 
 
The above schemes will be open up to November 30, 2013. Reserve Bank of 
India reserves the right to close the scheme earlier with due notice. 
 
Detailed operational instructions and changes in the extant regulations will 
follow.
