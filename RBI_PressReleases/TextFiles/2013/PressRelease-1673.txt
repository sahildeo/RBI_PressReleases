RBI Working Paper Series 4 /2013  
Monetary Policy Transmission Faster When Monetary System is in Deficit Mode 
The Reserve Bank of India today placed on its website a Working Paper titled 
“Financial Development and Monetary Policy Transmission across Financial 
Markets: What Do Daily Data tell for India?” under the RBI Working Paper Series. 
The paper has been authored by Dr. Partha Ray and Shri Edwin Prabu. 
Developed and integrated financial markets are pre-requisites for effective and 
credible transmission of monetary policy impulses. The more integrated financial 
markets are, in all likelihood the more would be the strength of monetary 
transmission across financial markets. It is in this context that this study looks into the 
extent of market integration and its implication for monetary policy taking the daily 
data for the period from January 2005 until November 2012.  
In specific terms, the paper  analyses two distinct but inter-related issues:       
(a) the extent of integration among different segments of financial markets; and        
(b) impact of monetary policy on financial markets. The markets considered are:       
(i) money market (comprising the call money, the collateralised borrowing and 
lending obligation (CBLO) and the market repo markets); (ii) bond market (comprising 
Government securities and corporate bonds markets); (iii) forex market (proxied by 
exchange rate);  and (iv) stock market (viz., NSE Nifty).  
Using a structural vector autoregression (SVAR) model and imposing 
identifying restrictions from behavioral patterns of the Indian financial markets, the 
study finds that the impact of monetary policy on the financial markets differs 
considerably across four periods classified based on the liquidity position in the 
system. The transmission of monetary policy works well in the call money rate, as it is 
impacted immediately with robustness. As regards other financial market variables, 
except for the stock market, the study could find evidence of transmission from the 
monetary policy shocks.  
Within the sample period of 2005-12, the study finds a distinct pattern of 
impact of monetary policy on financial markets depending on the stance of the 
monetary policy (i.e., whether it is expansionary or contractionary). The following 
results are highlighted in particular: 
• First, the transmission was swift and persistent for the period June 2010 to 
November 2012, when the liquidity was in deficit mode and the monetary policy 
was tightened.

• Second, the transmission was also exhibited in the period January 2005 to 
November 2006, when the liquidity was in surplus mode but monetary policy 
was tightened due to inflationary pressures.  
• Third, transmission was not on the expected lines for December 2006 to 
November 2008 period and December 2008 to May 2010 period, perhaps on 
account of measures initiated during global financial crisis.  
The evidence thus indicates that monetary policy transmission to financial 
markets in India is asymmetrical – it is faster and persistent when the monetary 
system is in deficit mode, than when it is in expansionary phase. 
The Reserve Bank of India introduced the RBI Working Papers series in 
March 2011. These papers present research in progress of the staff members of the 
Reserve Bank and are disseminated to elicit comments and further debate. The 
views expressed in these papers are those of authors and not those of the Reserve 
Bank of India. Comments and observations may kindly be forwarded to authors. 
Citation and use of such papers should take into account its provisional character.
