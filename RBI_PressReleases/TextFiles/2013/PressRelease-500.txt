RBI Governor launches new ISO 20022 compliant RTGS System 
Dr. Raghuram Rajan, Governor, Reserve Bank of India, today launched the new Real 
Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system of the Reserve Bank of India. Complimenting 
the entire team for successfully completing the project, the Governor said, "The new 
RTGS system is a great example of what we are capable of when we put our minds to 
it." He added that payment system like plumbing has to be efficient and ahead of the 
financial markets to be able to take care of the future developments in the financial 
markets. With its advanced liquidity and queue management features, the new RTGS 
system is expected to significantly improve the efficiency of financial markets. He 
hoped the new RTGS system would be such a driver for India's financial system.  
Reportedly the first in the world to be built on ISO 20022 messaging standards, the 
new RTGS system is highly scalable and will have several new functionalities. These 
include advance liquidity features, including gridlock resolution mechanism and hybrid 
settlement facility, facility to accept future value dated transactions, options to process 
multi-currency transactions, etc. These functionalities, as and when made available for 
use, will be notified to the participants.  
The new ISO 20022 compliant RTGS system provides three access options to 
participants – thick-client, Web-API (through INFINET or any other approved network) 
and Payment Originator module.  The participants can decide the mode of 
participation in the system based on the volume of transactions and the cost of setting 
up the infrastructure.  
The Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system is a large-value funds transfer 
system which banks use to settle interbank transfers for their own account as well as 
for their customers. It was first implemented in India in March 2004 as a major 
technology based electronic funds transfer system across the country. The system 
facilitates customer, inter-bank payment on a ‘real ’ time and on gross basis. The 
system also facilitates settlement of Multilateral Net Settlement Batch (MNSB) files 
emanating from other ancillary payment systems. The RTGS infrastructure is critical in 
facilitating the orderly settlement of payment obligations. The role of central banks  as 
operators of large-value payment systems is important in the context of the broader 
role of the central bank in a nation ’s financial system insofar as it offers “safety net ” 
attributes by providing final settlement in central bank money. 
RTGS is a critical Financial market Infrastructure (FMI) operated by the Reserve Bank 
of India and it will be assessed against the Committee on Payment and Settlement 
????? ???????Systems and the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (CPSS-
IOSCO) “Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures ” applicable to FMIs.  
With implementation of the new RTGS system, the existing RTGS system will cease 
to be operational. Further, the “RTGS System Regulations 2013 ” would replace the 
RTGS (Membership) Business Operating Guidelines, 2004 and RTGS (Membership) 
Regulations, 2004.
