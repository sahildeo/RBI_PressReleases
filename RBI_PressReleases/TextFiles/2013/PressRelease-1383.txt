International Banking Statistics of India:  
June, September and December 2012 – Data Release 
The Reserve Bank of India today released, on its Website, the data related to 
International Banking Statistics of India for the quarters ending June, September and 
December 2012. An article analysing broad trends under Locational and 
Consolidated Banking Statistics is being published in the July 2013 issue of the RBI 
Bulletin. The Locational Banking Statistics present data on international assets and 
liabilities according type of instrument/components, currency, country of residence 
and sector of counter-party/transacting unit, and nationality of reporting banks while 
Consolidated Banking Statistics cover data by residual maturity and sector of 
borrower along with the exposures by country of immediate borrower and on the 
reallocation of claims (i.e. risk transfers) to the country of ultimate risk.  
Highlights: 
• The international assets declined by 1.4 per cent at end of December 2012 as 
compared to a growth rate of 21.6 per cent as at end-March 2012. 
• In contrast, the international liabilities recorded a high growth of 25.5 per cent 
as at end-December 2012 from a moderate 8.6 per cent as at end-March 
2012. 
• The decline in international assets was led by the decline in NOSTRO 
balances while the increase in international liabilities was on account of NRE 
deposits and foreign currency borrowings. 
• The international claims of Indian banks, on immediate risk basis, on all other 
countries grew at a higher rate of 15.0 per cent as at end-December 2012 than 
14.0 per cent as at end-March 2012.
