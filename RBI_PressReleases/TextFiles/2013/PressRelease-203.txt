RBI seeks Comments on Draft Framework for dealing with  
Domestic Systemically Important Banks (D-SIBs)  
The Reserve Bank of India today released on its website, the draft framework for 
dealing with Domestic Systemically Important Banks (D-SIBs). The Reserve Bank has 
sought views/comments on the document from banks, other institutions and the public at 
large. Suggestions and comments on the draft framework may be sent to the Principal 
Chief General Manager, Reserve Bank of India, Department of Banking Operations and 
Development, Central Office, 12th floor, Central Office Building, Shahid Bhagat Singh 
Marg, Mumbai-400001 or emailed by December 31, 2013. 
The draft framework released today discusses the methodology to be adopted by 
the Reserve Bank for identifying the D-SIBs and proposes regulatory / supervisory 
policies which D-SIBs would be subjected to. The assessment methodology adopted by 
RBI is primarily based on the BCBS methodology for identifying the Global Systemically 
Important Banks (G-SIBs) with suitable modifications to capture domestic importance of 
a bank. The indicators which would be used for assessment are: size, 
interconnectedness, substitutability and complexity. Based on the sample of banks 
chosen for computation of their systemic importance, a relative composite systemic 
importance score of the banks will be computed. RBI will determine a cut-off score 
beyond which banks will be considered D-SIBs. Based on their systemic importance 
scores, banks will be plotted into different buckets. D-SIBs will be required to have 
additional Common Equity Tier 1 capital requirement ranging from 0.20% to 0.80% of 
risk weighted assets.  D-SIBs will also be subjected to differentiated supervisory 
requirements and higher intensity of supervision based on the risks they pose to the 
financial system.  The computation of systemic importance scores will be carried out at 
yearly intervals. 
The names of the banks classified as D-SIBs will be disclosed in the month of 
August every year starting from 2015. 
Background 
During the recent financial crisis, it was observed that problems faced by certain 
large and highly interconnected financial institutions hampered orderly functioning of the 
financial system, which in turn, harmed the real economy. Government intervention was 
considered necessary in many jurisdictions to ensure financial stability. Costs of public 
sector intervention and consequential increase in moral hazard require that future 
regulatory policies should aim at reducing the probability of failure of Systemically 
Important Banks (SIBs) and also should try to reduce the impact of the failure of these 
banks. The additional policies should also create level playing field between the SIBs 
and non-SIBs by reducing competitive advantages of SIBs in funding markets. The 
policies should endeavour to curb amplification of risk taking and reduce competitive 
distortions.

In October 2010, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) recommended that all 
member countries needed to have in place a framework to reduce risks attributable to 
Systemically Important Financial Institutions (SIFIs) in their jurisdictions. The Basel 
Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) came out with a framework in November 
2011 for identifying the Global Systemically Important Banks (G-SIBs) and the magnitude 
of additional loss absorbency capital requirements applicable to these G-SIBs.  BCBS 
further required all member countries to have a regulatory framework to deal with 
Domestic Systemically Important Banks (D-SIBs). 
The Reserve Bank had indicated in the second quarter review of monetary policy 
statement 2013-14 that it would place a draft of the proposed framework for D-SIBs on 
its website by end-November 2013.
