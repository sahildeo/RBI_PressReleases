Societies, West Bengal State has also been requested to issue an order for winding up 
the bank and appoint a liquidator for the bank.  
With the cancellation of licence and commencement of liquidation proceeding, the 
process of paying the depositors of the Kasundia Co-operative Bank Ltd. Howrah (West 
Bengal), the amount insured as per the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee 
Corporation Act, 1961 will be set in motion subject to terms and conditions of the Deposit 
Insurance Scheme. 
Upon liquidation, every depositor is entitled to repayment of his/her deposits up to 
a monetary ceiling of ` 1,00,000/- (Rupees One lakh only) from the Deposit Insurance

Background: 
The bank was granted a licence under Section 22 of the B. R. Act 1949 (AACS) 
by the Reserve Bank on July 26, 1986 to conduct banking business. The Statutory 
Inspection of the bank conducted under section 35 of the B. R. Act 1949 (AACS) from 
September 30, 2002 revealed that the financial position of the bank was deteriorating, 
resulting in inter-alia, deposit erosion of the bank to the extent of 11.5%.  
The financial indicators of the bank continued to deteriorate further as revealed 
during subsequent inspections conducted with reference to its financial position as on 
September 30, 2004, March 31, 2005 and March 31, 2006. The bank was placed under 
directions under Section 35A of the B. R. Act 1949 (AACS) on January 15, 2004, which 
were further modified in January 2007 prohibiting the bank from (i) accepting fresh 
deposits, (ii) allowing premature withdrawal of deposits and (iii) granting/renewal of any 
loan except CC/OD provided it is a standard account without any ceiling on withdrawals. 
The statutory inspection of the bank as on March 31, 2009 revealed further 
deterioration in the financial position of the bank with assessed net worth at (-) ` 1465.60 
lakh and deposit erosion of 69%. The gross and net NPAs of the bank were at                 
?nullnull???nullnullnull??2 
 
` 328.85 lakh and ` 94.14 lakh constituting 66.9% and 36.6% of the gross and net 
advances respectively. The bank had not complied with section 11 (1) and Section 22 (3) 
of the B.R. Act 1949 (AACS) and also defaulted in compliance with regulatory reserve 
requirement of CRR and SLR. The bank faced serious liquidity constraints and frequently 
resorted to sale of Government Securities and borrowings from the West Bengal State 
Co-operative Bank Ltd. 
In view of the deteriorating financial position of the bank, a Show Cause Notice 
(SCN) seeking reasons as to why the banking licence issued to the bank should not be 
cancelled was issued on August 7, 2009. The bank in its reply dated September 10, 
2009 stated that it would be able to achieve positive net worth and comply with CRAR 
requirements in five years with the proposed financial support from the State 
Government. The State Government assured support in the form of Special Reserve 
Fund with a view to making the bank’s net worth positive. In view of this, the proposed 
action of cancellation of bank’s licence was deferred.  
During the financial year 2009-10, the bank had resorted to borrowings from the 
West Bengal State Co-operative Bank Ltd. by availing loan against fixed deposits without 
prior approval from RBI in violation of extant directions. Consequently, a penalty of ` 1.00 
lakh was imposed  on the bank on October 01, 2010 in terms of the provisions of Section 
47A(1)(b) of B.R. Act 1949 read with Section 46(4) of the B.R. Act 1949, which was paid 
by the bank on November 04, 2010. 
The statutory inspection with respect to position as on March 31, 2010 indicated 
alarming deterioration in financial position with assessed net worth at  (-) ` 1819.50 lakh 
and deposit erosion of 74.7%, with gross and Net NPA constituting 72.7% and 66.70% 
respectively.  
The statutory inspection of the bank conducted with reference to the bank’s 
financial position as on March 31, 2011 revealed deteriorated financial position with 
assessed net worth (-) ` 891.32 lakh, gross and net NPA still at 77.5% and 44.4%  in 
spite of capital infusion of  ` 14.66 crores by the State Government. 
In July 2012, the bank faced severe liquidity crunch. The bank had stopped cash 
payments completely and returned most of the outward clearing instruments due to 
shortage of funds with clearing banker. In view of the above exceptional circumstances 
and the interest of depositors, all inclusive direction under section 35 A of B.R. Act 1949 
(AACS) was imposed on the bank on September 25, 2012, restricting withdrawal of 
deposits up to  ` 1000/- per depositor.  
The statutory inspection of the bank as on March 31, 2012 revealed that the 
assessed net worth had significantly eroded at (-) ` 2142.41 lakh, CRAR at (-) 318.96% 
and Gross and Net NPA at 77.27% and 46.58% respectively. Deposit erosion of the bank 
stood the alarming level of 55.7%. The assessed net loss of the bank stood at ` 1769.21 
lakh, with accumulated loss at ` 3906.30 lakh. The bank also violated the extant RBI 
directions. 
In view of the above, another show cause notice (SCN) for cancellation of licence 
under Section 22 of B.R. Act 1949 (AACS) was issued to the bank on February 5, 2013. 
The bank's reply dated March 7, 2013 was examined and found to be not satisfactory. In 
view of the bank’s precarious financial position with no merger proposal forthcoming and 
chances of its revival being remote, continuation of the bank would have been against 
public interest. The Reserve Bank of India, therefore, cancelled the licence of the bank in 
the interest of bank's depositors.
