The Reserve Bank of India, today, signed Memoranda of Understanding 
(MoU) on “Supervisory Cooperation and Exchange of Supervisory Information” with 
Prudential Supervisory Authority (Autorité de Contrôle Prudentiel -ACP), Banque De 
France (BdF), France. The Reserve Bank has been signing the Memorandum of 
Understanding (MoU) with supervisors of other countries to promote greater            
co-operation and sharing of supervisory information between the two supervisors.  
With this, RBI has signed sixteen such MoUs.  
 The MOU was signed by Mr. Robert Ophele, Deputy Governor, BdF and 
Chairman of Board of the ACP and by Shri G. Jaganmohan Rao, Chief General 
Manager-in-Charge, Department of Banking Supervision, on behalf of RBI. The MoU 
was signed in the presence of Dr. K.C. Chakrabarty, Deputy Governor, and Mrs. LE 
Lorier, Deputy Governor, BdF.  The function was held at College of Agricultural 
Banking, Pune.  
The MoU provides a formal, yet legally non-binding, gateway of information 
between the supervisors.  The MoU provides for sharing of information on health of 
the supervised entities, cooperation between the supervisors during on-site 
examinations, coordinated efforts during times of crises, frequent meetings between 
the supervisors, preserving the confidentiality of information shared. The MoU signing 
now does not mean that there was no cooperation earlier for exchange of 
information. Thus MoU is not an event but a process of strengthening the 
cooperation. This is done through pre-identified contact points as mentioned in the 
MoU which makes it easier for either supervisor to get in touch with his counterpart in 
a far more easier manner.  The MoU does not override the laws of the land of either 
supervisor but only tries to build an environment of supervisory cooperation and 
coordination in complete adherence to such laws. The MoU is not just a document 
but a mechanism that aims to combine the supervisory strengths of both supervisors 
in overseeing the supervised entities and address the concerns in a timely manner.
