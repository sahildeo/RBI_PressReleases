Report of the Expert Committee  
(Chairman: Dr. Prakash Bakshi, Chairman, NABARD) on  
Streamlining of  Short Term Co-operative Credit Structure (STCCS) 
The Reserve Bank of India released on its website today, the report of the 
Expert Committee (Chairman: Dr. Prakash Bakshi, Chairman, NABARD) constituted 
to review the existing Short Term Cooperative Credit Structure (STCCS) focusing on 
structural constraints in rural credit delivery system and explore various ways to 
strengthen the rural cooperative credit architecture with appropriate institutions and 
instruments of credit to fulfill credit needs. The Committee made an in-depth analysis 
of the STCCS and examined various alternatives with a view to reducing the cost of 
credit, including feasibility of setting up of a two-tier STCCS as against the existing 
three-tier structure. 
Major Recommendations of the Committee 
By adopting a wide and exhaustive consultation process, the Committee 
identified key issues facing diverse segments and sections of cooperative credit 
structure; examined them thoroughly. Some of the important observations/ 
recommendations made by the committee include; 
i) For providing safety of deposits and efficient loan services to farmers, the 
Committee has recommended that PACS should work only as business 
correspondents (BCs) on behalf of banks and should not themselves act as 
financial intermediaries. In addition, PACS should provide a range of other fee 
based financial and non-financial products. The immediate consequence of 
such a change would be that all depositors and borrowers in villages would 
become direct member clients of the CCBs. 
ii) The Committee observed that 238 of the 370 CCBs in the country already have 
CRAR of 7% or above, and about two thirds of them would be able to internally 
generate enough capital to maintain a sustainable CRAR of at least 9% by 
2016-17. About 209 of the 370 CCBs would require additional capital 
aggregating Rs 6,500 crore in four years to attain 9% CRAR by 2016-17. It is 
estimated that despite these measures, about 60 CCBs will not become 
sustainable and would need to be merged with other CCBs. The Committee has 
suggested a roadmap for such an exercise.  
iii) Some of the CCBs do not have adequate capital to meet even the relaxed 
licensing norm of 4% CRAR. The Committee recommends that 31 March 2013 
may be set as the deadline for these banks to mobilise the required capital 
either internally or from any other external source so as to achieve 4% CRAR, 
failing which RBI should take the necessary regulatory action.

iv) The Committee has also estimated that about 58 CCBs would generally not be 
able to mobilise the required capital, or their business sizes are so small that 
they would not be sustainable in the long run and would have to be therefore 
consolidated with other CCB(s).  
v) Most of the CCBs and StCBs will also have to take concrete steps to improve 
their internal systems, human resources, and technology adoption. The 
Committee has also recommended various steps for improving the governance 
and management in StCBs and CCBs on the lines of recommendations of the 
Vaidyanathan Task Force. 
vi) RBI to modify banking licence of any CCB to include additional operational area 
from which a PACS could work as BC of a CCB. 
vii) 30 September 2013 to be set as deadline for all StCBs and CCBs to be fully 
operational on CBS and providing RTGS, NEFT, ATM and POS device based 
services. 
viii) StCBs and CCBs to be fully included in the financial inclusion and EBT drive. 
Deposits of governments and government agencies to be also made in StCBs 
and CCBs which have achieved 7% CRAR and are on CBS. 
ix) CCBs and StCBs to be covered by the banking Ombudsman or a similar 
mechanism that may be developed by RBI with NABARD. 
x) A working group to be set up to make recommendations on the human 
resources requirements following the transition of StCBs and CCBs on CBS and 
other ICT platforms. 
The recommendations of the Committee are expected to have significant 
impact in addressing issues related to cooperative credit structure.
