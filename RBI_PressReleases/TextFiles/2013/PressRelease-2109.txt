Minutes of the January 23, 2013 Meeting of the  
Technical Advisory Committee on Monetary Policy  
 
The thirty first meeting of the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) on 
Monetary Policy was held on January 23, 2013 in the run up to the Third Quarter 
Review of Monetary Policy 2012-13 on January 29, 2013. The main points of 
discussion in the meeting are set out below.  
1. On global economic conditions, most of the Members were of the view that 
the situation is better than it was six months ago and the outlook has also 
improved. In particular, the probability of a significant adverse event is much 
lower now, even though some of the major economies - which are generally 
seen as the locomotives of global growth - continue to face sluggish growth 
prospects. Retail sales in the US rose more than expected in December and 
housing starts were at a four-year high. In Europe even Germany contracted 
in the fourth quarter of 2012. France could face another credit rating 
downgrade on the likelihood of missing deficit reduction targets. Yet European 
bond yields have been receding from crisis levels. In China, economic growth 
has accelerated for the first time in two years, rising to 7.9 per cent in the 
fourth quarter. Going ahead, there may be some softening of global 
commodity prices. 
2. On the domestic front, Members were of the view that there has been an 
improvement in sentiment since September when the Government initiated 
measures to attract FDI and for fiscal consolidation. The establishment of the 
Cabinet Committee on Investment to fast-track delayed projects is also a 
welcome step. However, the underlying macroeconomic conditions are still 
sluggish. Investment has not revived yet and contraction is still underway in 
the capital goods industries. Also, demand is trailing behind capacity. 
Furthermore, besides persisting infrastructure constraints, there are 
continuing signs of slack in the service sector, which accounts for two-thirds of 
GDP. However, in 2013-14, if there are no major shocks and the budget 
perseveres with fiscal consolidation measures, investor confidence may 
improve further and concomitantly investment could pick up.  
3. Members were of the opinion that WPI inflation, despite the recent 
deceleration, continues to be high, and CPI inflation in double digits is a 
matter of concern. The economy should benefit from the likely softening of 
global commodity prices which will bring down headline inflation. Going 
forward, inflation is likely to rise again as the Government moves to correct 
petroleum product prices. The CPI is already carrying some cost of fiscal 
correction since the base of the service tax has been substantially increased. 
According to some Members’ assessment, inflation in 2013-14 could be only 
marginally lower than in 2012-13.

4. On the fiscal front, Members thought that the fiscal situation is still very 
difficult. However, the recent fiscal consolidation efforts should be taken as 
significant efforts, particularly the (i) increase in railway fares; (ii) recent 
deregulation of diesel prices; and (iii) emphasis on containing the size of the 
fiscal deficit.  Some Members were of the view that government expenditure is 
flabby and despite the recent efforts, there is still an overwhelming likelihood 
that the fiscal deficit will be at a minimum of 5.5 per cent of GDP when the 
actuals become available. Lack of fiscal discipline is going to make it difficult 
for the Reserve Bank to sustain its efforts to support growth through policy 
easing.  
5. On the balance of payments (BoP), the current account deficit (CAD) to GDP 
ratio reached a historic high in the second quarter of 2012-13. Members 
regarded it as the most important macroeconomic concern. Financing such 
high levels of CAD is worrisome, as it is accentuating external sector 
vulnerability. While the likely softening of global commodity prices may bring 
down the CAD, the elevated levels of oil and gold imports are a major 
concern. Gold demand exhibited a seasonal surge in November-December. 
Members felt that the current large demand of gold is due to its value as an 
asset class. Once inflation subsides and growth improves, people will have 
less incentive for flight to safe haven assets.  
6. On monetary policy measures, all external Members were unanimous in 
recommending a reduction in the policy repo rate. Four of the six Members 
suggested that the Reserve Bank should reduce the policy rate by 25 basis 
points. They felt that favourable global conditions as well as marginal decline 
in WPI inflation provide room for some monetary easing. This would also 
support the reform initiatives implemented by the Government. Two of these 
Members felt that a 25 basis points reduction in the repo rate alone may not 
induce banks to reduce their lending rates and a cut in the CRR of 25 basis 
points to nudge the lending rates down is in order. This would also enable 
loan rates to reduce more than deposit rates. One of the other two Members 
felt that the Reserve Bank should make use of open market operations 
(OMOs) to manage liquidity and keep the CRR unchanged. Two Members 
recommended a sharper reduction in the repo rate by 50 basis points and use 
of OMOs to manage liquidity. One of these two Members was indifferent 
between a 50 basis points cut in January 2013 versus a 25 basis points cut in 
January followed by a 25 basis points cut after presentation of the Union 
budget if it envisages credible consolidation and keeps the fiscal deficit 
contained to less than 5 per cent of GDP in 2013-14. In this scenario, there 
could be some post-budget expectations for monetary policy to reinforce the 
impact of fiscal consolidation. The other Member was of the view that a 50 
basis points cut in repo rate would increase working capital loans, thereby 
increasing capacity utilisation. This would invigorate growth and also work 
towards reduction in inflation.  
7. The meeting was chaired by Dr. D. Subbarao, Governor. Other internal 
Members present were: Dr. Urjit R. Patel (Vice-Chairman), Dr. K.C. 
Chakrabarty, Shri Anand Sinha and Shri Harun R. Khan, Deputy Governors; 
and external Members, Shri Y.H. Malegam, Prof. Indira Rajaraman, Prof. 
Sudipto Mundle and Dr. Shankar Acharya. Prof. Errol D ’Souza and Prof. 
Ashima Goyal, who could not attend the meeting, submitted their written 
views. Officials of the Reserve Bank Shri Deepak Mohanty, Dr. Michael D. 
Patra and Dr. B.K. Bhoi were in attendance.  3 
 
8. Since February 2011, the Reserve Bank has been placing the main points of 
discussions of the TAC on Monetary Policy meetings in the public domain with 
a lag of roughly four weeks after the meeting.
