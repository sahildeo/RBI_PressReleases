Statement on Forex Market 
       Volatility in the domestic foreign exchange market has  diminished in the last 
few weeks. 
      Beginning last week, the Public Sector Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) have 
started accessing the FX market for their entire daily dollar demands.  Going forward, 
the OMCs have been advised to smoothen their daily dollar demand, so that the 
upcoming bunched up demands on any particular day is covered in advance in the 
forward forex market or covered on days with low demand. Apart from covering in the 
forward markets, the OMCs have also been advised to utilize the revolving lines of 
credit made available by banks with the specific objective of tiding over humps in 
dollar demands. Finally, the Reserve Bank will consider opening the swap window to 
OMCs on the rare days when there is a pronounced spurt in dollar demand in the FX 
market. 
    Given the backdrop of broad stability returning to the forex market, on the 
basis of an ongoing review of the demand conditions in the market,  OMCs have 
been allowed to source dollars even  beyond their  normal daily requirements. This 
process has already been put in place last week and it is expected that the excess 
demand of the OMCs will be funneled to meet their swap (second leg) commitments 
over a period of time.  
   As indicated earlier, the Reserve Bank is closely monitoring the market and 
will continue to keep all options open regarding settlement of  OMC swaps, including 
Rupee settlement, depending upon the evolving flow dynamics in the market.  
   In line with our earlier announcement, the swap windows for FCNR(B) funds 
and Banks' Overseas Borrowings have since been closed. The two swap windows 
have mobilized a sum of USD 34 billion. Since the RBI swap windows are now 
closed, going forward, any new funds raised from FCNR deposits or from banks' 
borrowings will flow directly into the market instead of to RBI's FX reserves .
