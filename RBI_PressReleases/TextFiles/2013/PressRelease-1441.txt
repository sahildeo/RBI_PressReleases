Restructuring of India’s Domestic and External Policies needed for  
Effective Partnership between India and China: RBI’s Project Research Study 
The Reserve Bank India today released a Project Research Study titled “India 
China Bilateral Trade Relationship” on its website. This Project Research Study was 
entrusted to Prof. S. K Mohanty, Research and Information System for Developing 
Countries (RIS), New Delhi with the objective to carry out an in-depth analysis on 
trade linkage between India and China in view of the widening trade deficit of India 
against China. 
The Project Research Study recognises the irreversible nature of economic 
liberalisation undertaken in both countries, India and China, in their quest for greater 
integration with the world economy and attempts to identify synergies in their 
development process by analysing existing patterns of their trade and sectoral 
complementarities for further economic engagement.  
The major findings of the Project Research Study are:  
(i) As the trade flows of both the countries are concentrated in Asia, 
particularly South-East and East Asia, regionalism can offer a credible 
platform to augment trade;  
(ii) Unlike popular perception, bilateral imports of India from China have 
been uncompetitive in several sectors including textiles and clothing, 
automotive, chemicals, etc. among others;  
(iii) Based on the methodology of Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA), 
the study finds that India has been importing from China large amount of 
uncompetitive products which can easily be supplied to India by other 
competitors of China at a comparatively cheaper price;  
(iv) Based on simulations under Computed General Equilibrium (CGE) 
modelling, the study finds that liberalisation among ASEAN+3 countries 
alone may not generate the expected level of welfare gain irrespective of 
their level of economic integration;  and  
(v) Based on dynamic panel data analysis, the Project Research Study 
finds that appreciation/depreciation of Yuan has significant impact on 
India’s exports to other countries.

According to the study, India is likely to gain from its engagement with China, 
provided a cautious approach is pursued to ensure long-term interests of India are 
preserved in its bilateral economic engagement. This requires restructuring of India’s 
domestic and external policies to ensure effective partnership between the two 
neighbouring countries. 
The Reserve Bank introduced a “Research Project Study/Report Series” with 
a view to disseminating the research output undertaken with the support of external 
experts under the Reserve Bank’s Scheme for support of economic research in 
areas like real economy, monetary sector, financial economics etc. This would 
available in its website under ‘Publications >Occasional>> Project Research Study’  
Research Project Studies/Reports are another effort made by the Reserve 
Bank for encouraging policy-oriented research and also providing data and reports 
for researchers at large. The Research Projects being funded under the scheme are 
assigned to external research institutions/scholars wherein internal researchers also 
collaborate. On completion of these projects, the studies are released on the 
Reserve Bank’s website for wider circulation with a view to generating constructive 
discussion among economists and policy makers on subjects of current interest.  
The views expressed in all the research publications of the Reserve Bank, 
including the Research Project Studies/Reports, do not necessarily reflect the views

Reports/Studies rests with the Reserve Bank of India.
