RBI extends Liquidity Support to Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises  
Refinance to SIDBI to ease Liquidity Stress to MSE Sector 
 In view of the need to ease the liquidity stress to Micro and Small Enterprises 
(MSE) sector which is employment intensive and contributes significantly to exports, 
it has been decided to provide refinance of an amount of ` 5,000 crore to the Small 
Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) under the provisions of Section 17(4H) 
of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934.  
The refinance will be available for direct liquidity support to finance 
receivables, including export receivable, to MSEs by SIDBI or for liquidity support to 
MSEs through selected intermediaries, that is, banks, Non-Banking Financial 
Companies (NBFCs) and State Finance Corporations (SFCs). The refinance will be 
available against receivables, including export receivables, outstanding as on 
November 14, 2013 onwards. The facility will be available at the prevailing 14-day 
term repo rate for a period of 90 days. During this 90-day period, the amount can be 
flexibly drawn and repaid. At the end of the 90-day period, the drawal can also be 
rolled over. The refinance facility will be available for a period of one year up to 
November 13, 2014. The utilisation of funds will be governed by the policy approved 
by the Board of SIDBI.  
Incremental credit to Medium Enterprises to qualify as Priority Sector 
 The Medium Sector (as defined vide notification No.S.O.1722(E) dated 
October 5, 2006 of the Ministry of Small Scale Industries) is also facing liquidity 
tightness. In order to enhance credit delivery to the medium sector, it has been 
decided to include, as eligible priority sector lending, incremental credit, including 
export credit, extended to the medium enterprises by the scheduled commercial 
banks (excluding RRBs) over the outstanding credit as on November 13, 2013. The 
facility will be available upto March 31, 2014 and will be within the overall target of 40 
per cent.  
Background 
The liquidity support comes in the wake of slowdown in the economy which 
has resulted in liquidity tightness in a large number of Micro and Small Enterprises 
(MSEs) in the manufacturing and services sector, particularly due to delayed 
settlement of receivables from large corporate, Public Sector Undertakings and 
government departments.
