Reserve Bank Cancels the Licence of  
Vaishali Urban Co-operative Bank Ltd. (Jaipur) 
In view of the fact that The Vaishali Urban Co-operative Bank Ltd. Jaipur, 
Rajasthan, has ceased to be solvent, all efforts to revive it having failed and the 
depositors being inconvenienced by the continued uncertainty, the Reserve Bank of 
India delivered the order cancelling its licence to the bank on June 12, 2013. The 
Registrar of Co-operative societies, Government of Rajasthan has also been 
requested to issue an order for winding up the bank and appoint a liquidator for the 
bank. It may be highlighted that on liquidation, every depositor is entitled to 
repayment of his/her  deposits up to a monetary ceiling of  `1,00,000/- (Rupees one 
lakh  only)  from the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation under 
usual terms and conditions. 
The bank was granted a licence by the Reserve Bank of India on March 2, 
1998 to conduct  banking business under Section 22 of the Banking Regulation Act, 
1949 (As Applicable to Co-operative Societies). 
The statutory inspection conducted under Section 35 of the Act with reference 
to its financial position as on March 31, 2008 had reported large scale irregularities in 
the loans and advances/overdraft relating to directors and their relatives. As 
involvement of management in these irregularities was apparent, the Registrar of Co-
operative Societies, Rajasthan had superseded the Board and appointed an 
Administrator on February 27, 2009 on the requisition of the Reserve Bank of India. 
  The statutory inspection of the bank as on March 31, 2009,   indicated that  the 
bank’s net worth was fully eroded, the deposits were eroded to the extent of  28.51%  
of total deposits and the gross NPAs were 18.66%. Further the bank failed to report 
fraud involving fictitious accounts and understatement of liabilities to the RBI.   
 Accordingly, directions under Section 35 A of B. R. Act, 1949 (AACS) were 
imposed on the bank with effect from the close of business on July 12, 2010 
restricting, inter alia, withdrawal in excess of ` 1000/- per deposit account. 
  Keeping in view the deteriorating financial position and irregularities stated 
above a Show Cause Notice (SCN) was issued to the bank on November 04, 2011.  
The reply of the bank dated December 12, 2011 to the SCN was not found 
satisfactory.  
The statutory inspection as on March 31, 2010, and 2011 also indicated no 
improvement and the bank continued to function in violation of the provisions of 
Section 11(1) and 22 (3) (a) of the Act ibid.

The Statutory Inspection as on March 31, 2012 revealed that the bank was not 
complying with the provisions of Section 11(1) and 22 (23) (a)  of the Act. It had  a 
negative CRAR of 753.77%, assessed  net worth of  (-) 689.84 Lakh,  accumulated 
loss of  ` 880.35 Lakh and deposit erosion had reached the alarming level of 42.14%. 
The second SCN dated December 14, 2012 was issued to the bank for                       
cancellation of banking licence   issued to the bank.  The bank in its reply admitted to 
the erosion  in deposits and reiterated its  proposal for infusion  of capital without  
filing  FIR  against persons  responsible for the frauds.  
From the facts and circumstances stated above it is observed that:                    
(i) The bank does not comply with the provisions of Sections 11(1), 18 and 24 
of BR   Act. 
(ii) The bank is not in a position to pay its present and future depositors and as 
such, does not comply with Section 22(3) (a) of the Act. 
(iii) The affairs of the bank were and are being conducted in a manner 
detrimental to the interests of the depositors which implies non compliance 
with Section 22(3) (b) of the Act. 
(iv) The financial position of the bank leaves little scope for its revival. 
(v) Public interest would be adversely affected if the bank is allowed to carry 
on its business any further. 
In view of the above the licence granted to the bank to conduct banking 
business deserved to be cancelled. Accordingly, the licence dated March 2, 1998                      
granted to the Vaishali Urban Co-operative Bank Ltd., Jaipur, Rajashan                       
to conduct banking business in India under Section 22 of the Act has been cancelled. 
With the cancellation of licence and commencement of liquidation  proceedings, the  
process of paying the depositors of  the Vaishali Urban Co-operative Bank  Ltd., 
Jaipur, Rajasthan  will be set in motion subject to the terms and  conditions of the 
Deposit Insurance Scheme. 
Consequent to the cancellation of its licence,  The Vaishali Urban Co-
operative Bank Ltd., Jaipur, Rajasthan is prohibited from carrying on ‘banking 
business’ as defined in  Section 5(b)  of Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (AACS)  
including acceptance and repayment of deposits.
