RBI releases Minutes of the July 24, 2013 Meeting of the  
Technical Advisory Committee on Monetary Policy  
The thirty third meeting of the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) on 
Monetary Policy was held on July 24, 2013 in the run up to the First Quarter Review 
of  Monetary Policy 2013-14 on July 30, 2013. The main points of discussion in the 
meeting are set out below.  
1. Members were of the view that the global economy remains subdued. Most 
Members felt that while quantitative easing (QE) in the US cannot continue 
forever, its withdrawal could well be slow. In the euro area, the European 
Central Bank has stressed its commitment to keep interest rates low for an 
extended period of time. Only Germany has marginally managed to avert 
recession. In the UK, the new Governor of the Bank of England had confirmed 
keeping interest rates at a record low for longer than investors had expected. 
In China, banks are now allowed to set their own lending rates, subject to a 
ceiling. The recent surge in interbank rates and the money market cash 
squeeze in the financial markets will reduce credit growth and also growth of 
the Chinese economy. Brazil has raised the benchmark interest rate for the 
third consecutive time and is possibly behind the world’s biggest tightening 
cycle with its currency weakening by about 13.0 per cent in the past three 
months on capital outflows due to withdrawals from equity mutual funds. 
2. On growth, Members’ assessment was that domestic activity has slowed down 
and industrial production is weak. The confidence level of investors has 
worsened and most investment plans have been kept on hold.  Even though 
firms are cash rich and liquidity is adequate, they are not taking any 
investment decisions. Smaller entities are suffering, mostly on account of 
working capital and supply constraints. However, at present, the IT sector is 
doing well on account of the positive outlook from the US although exports to 
the euro area have been adversely affected. One Member was of the view that 
since IIP covers only large firms and does not include small and medium 
enterprises, it may be overestimating the slowdown. The actual picture will be 
revealed by the data of annual survey of industries. 
3. Regarding inflation, Members’ were of the view that though the monsoon has 
been good, inflation facing consumers is still high. Food prices are still 
elevated and the food security bill will aggravate food price inflation as it will tilt 
supply towards cereals and away from other farm produce (proteins), which 
will raise food prices further. Fuel under-recoveries are also a consideration. 
On the other hand, rupee depreciation has not had much impact on inflation, 
reflecting the weak pricing power of corporates. With global commodity prices

low and the output gap negative, Members expected  inflation to be lower than 
what it was over the past year. On risks to inflation, Members noted that the 
inflation expectations have not declined significantly and the fear of 
resurgence of inflation was still high. One Member wanted a transition by the 
Reserve Bank from the wholesale price index to the consumer price index as 
the indicator used for monetary policy communication.  
4. On the fiscal front, Members hoped that the fiscal deficit is reduced in a 
manner that is not growth punishing, i.e., that capital expenditure should not 
be cut down. According to them, the real cure was in reducing the revenue 
deficit and undertaking serious economic reforms. Members desired that the 
Reserve Bank impress on the government the need to address supply side 
constraints which are causing inflationary pressure, especially on the food 
front. 
5. The Members were of the view that developments in the external sector – 
large current account deficit (CAD) and pressure on the rupee – is the 
immediate concern that needs to be addressed. The CAD is high and 
unsustainable, and the net international investment position has worsened by 
50.0 per cent in the last two years. Some Members suggested that in these 
circumstances, the Reserve Bank should let the real effective exchange rate 
depreciate to help regain competitiveness that Indian exports have lost. 
According to one Member, the CAD in India is uniquely segmented. While the 
non-gold component reflects structural infirmity of the real sector, the gold 
CAD mirrors structural infirmity of the financial sector. The measures taken on 
gold are proving to be effective and may help in containing CAD. On external 
risks, some Members were of the view that markets are forward-looking and 
have already factored in the impact of tapering of QE by the US. 
6. On the recent measures taken by the Reserve Bank to contain the exchange 
market volatility, one Member was of the view that since April 2012, the 
Reserve Bank has reduced the policy repo rate by 125 basis points (bps), 
CRR by 75 bps and SLR by 100 bps and the impact of these measures is still 
unfolding. The recent actions of increasing the marginal standing facility rate 
and squeezing liquidity out of the system are not inconsistent with its long-term 
commitment on growth. Another Member was of the opinion that looking at 
implied volatility and forward positions, the measures could be gradually 
withdrawn. The CAD is high since domestic financial saving is falling - in this 
regard, the objective of market development should not be lost sight of for 
enhancing household saving. Another Member was of the view that if 
monetary conditions have to be tightened in defence of the rupee, it would 
have been better to simply raise the policy rate by, say, 100 basis points, 
widen the corridor by an equivalent amount and indicate that this is a 
temporary measure. Yet another Member felt that the Reserve Bank has 
tinkered with the operating framework of the monetary policy. Once the width 
of the interest rate corridor is raised, the market understands that the Reserve 
Bank is open to more interest rate volatility. Volatility in the money market 
distorts the monetary policy signal, affecting its credibility. In this Member’s 
view, it would have been  more appropriate to raise the cash reserve ratio to 
ensure that banks do not use their excess liquidity to make gains in the forex 
markets. However this Member was more sympathetic of the measures taken 
by the Reserve Bank on July 23, 2013.  3 
 
7. On monetary policy measures, four of the seven Members recommended 
maintenance of status quo in the policy repo rate. In their view, though growth 
and inflation are projected to move down, we still have to guard against high 
inflation expectations that can destabilize the momentum of the economy. 
Moreover, the external front is fragile and warrants that we do not do anything 
that can send wrong signals about our discounting the possibility of capital 
outflows. Of these, one Member was not in favour of any change to the policy 
rate till the operational architecture, through which monetary policy is steered, 
goes back to a symmetric corridor within the standing facilities that provides a 
small window within which overnight rates move. In this Member’s view, to act 
without that situation having been reached, would be destabilizing. Two 
Members recommended a reduction in the policy repo rate by 25 basis points 
to improve sentiment and show sensitivity to growth. One Member 
recommended a repo rate increase by 25 basis points given the expectation of 
higher volatility in the exchange rate in the second half of 2013. To ameliorate 
the fund constraints of small scale enterprises, one Member suggested the 
Reserve Bank to open a bill discounting window for this sector. Another 
Member recommended that the Reserve Bank should show its commitment to 
growth by reducing the procedural infirmities, specifically those that lead to 
delays in granting of loans.   
8. The meeting was chaired by Dr. D. Subbarao, Governor. Other internal 
Members present were: Dr. Urjit R. Patel (Vice-Chairman), Dr. K.C. 
Chakrabarty, Shri Anand Sinha and Shri Harun R. Khan, Deputy Governors; 
and external Members present were: Shri Y.H. Malegam, Prof. Indira 
Rajaraman, Dr. Arvind Virmani, Prof. Ashima Goyal and Dr. Chetan Ghate. Dr. 
Shankar Acharya and Prof. Errol D’Souza who could not attend the meeting, 
submitted their written views. Officials of the Reserve Bank Shri Deepak 
Mohanty, Dr. Michael D. Patra, Shri B.M. Misra, Dr. B.K. Bhoi and Shri 
Pardeep Maria were in attendance.  
9. Since February 2011, the Reserve Bank has been placing the main points of 
discussions of the meetings of TAC on Monetary Policy in the public domain 
with a lag of roughly four weeks after the meeting.
