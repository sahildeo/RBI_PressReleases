Carrying of INR 10,000 by Non-residents and Residents : RBI Clarifies 
In terms of instructions issued vide A.P. (Dir Series) circular No.45 dated 
September 16, 2013, the Reserve Bank of India had facilitated encashment of rupees 
into convertible currencies even beyond Immigration/Customs desk.  This instruction 
has been misreported in certain sections of the media as a new restriction imposed 
by the Reserve Bank.  The Reserve Bank issues the following clarifications in this 
regard: 
(1)  A non-resident is currently not allowed to carry Indian currency notes beyond 
Indian border, since the Indian currency is not yet convertible.  This position 
has been in existence since several years and has not been altered in any 
way. This restriction is currently under review. 
(2)  Earlier, non-residents leaving the Indian shores, had to convert the unspent 
Indian currency into any convertible currency before the Immigration/Customs 
desk. 
(3)  The Reserve Bank has been receiving requests to permit Indian currency to 
be carried into Duty free area as well and accordingly facilitate their 
conversion before boarding the flight by allowing money changing facilities in 
the Duty free/security hold area. 
(4)  The above request, which is in the nature of further liberalisation of exchange 
control, has been enabled vide the Reserve Bank’s circular of September 16, 
2013.  It is thus erroneous to construe this facilitation as any form of additional 
control. 
Incidentally, the Reserve Bank has also issued an A.P.(DIR Series) Circular No. 
39 on September 6, 2013  facilitating any person resident in India to take outside 
India or having gone out of India on a temporary visit, to bring into India (other than to 
and from Nepal and Bhutan) currency notes up to an amount not exceeding 
INR10,000/- per person from an earlier limit of INR 7,500/- per person. This limit has 
been enhanced to provide greater flexibility to the residents travelling abroad in 
 meeting their  immediate personal expenses like taxi fare, hotel bills, etc. on arrival.
