A meeting of the Sub Committee of the Financial Stability and Development 
Council (FSDC) was held today in Kolkata. Dr. Raghuram G Rajan, Governor, 
Reserve Bank of India, chaired the meeting. The meeting was attended by Shri U. K. 
Sinha, Chairman, Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI); Shri T. S. Vijayan, 
Chairman, Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA); Shri Ramesh 
Abhishek, Chairman, Forward Market Commission (FMC); Deputy Governors of RBI, 
Dr. K.C. Chakrabarty, Shri Anand Sinha and Shri H. R. Khan; Executive Director of 
RBI, Shri G. Gopalakrishna; and other officials.  
The Sub Committee discussed the recent trends in the current account deficit 
and relative stability in the foreign exchange markets due to measures initiated by 
the regulators and the Government and also the improvement in the external 
environment. Other major issues taken up in the meeting included concerns relating 
to the deteriorating asset quality of banks. The Reserve Bank will shortly bring out 
draft guidelines to address issues relating to asset quality.  
The Sub Committee decided on a coordinated approach to the 
implementation of some non-legislative recommendations of the Financial Sector 
Legislative Reforms Council (FSLRC) within a defined timeframe. The desirability of 
developing a common repository of information on financial assets was discussed. It 
was decided that the Inter Regulatory Technical Group, among other issues, would 
also explore implementation of such a repository in a progressive manner.
