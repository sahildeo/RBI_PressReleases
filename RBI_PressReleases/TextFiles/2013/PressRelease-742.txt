Background 
The bank was granted a licence by the Reserve Bank of India on July 23, 
1998 to commence banking business. The statutory inspection of the bank carried 
out under Section 35 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (As Applicable to 
Cooperative Societies) [the Act] with reference to its financial position as on March 
31, 2010 revealed that it had not maintained statutory liquidity reserves. The bank 
had also exceeded single group exposure limit in respect of a bank guarantee 
amounting to `  five crore. The bank had sanctioned unsecured advances in excess 
of prescribed limits.

The statutory inspection of the bank carried out under Section 35 of the Act 
with reference to its financial position as on March 31, 2011 revealed that some 
irregularities, which were pointed out in pervious statutory inspection, were 
persistent. Its credit deposit ratio had increased to 148.53 per cent, much beyond the 
prudential upper limit of 70 per cent  The files and relevant records of the cases, 
where exposure limit had been exceeded, were not made available to the Inspecting 
Officer during the inspection. The bank did not make any provision against the  bank  
guarantee amounting to ` five crore invoked by Mahamedha Urban Co-operative 
Bank Ltd., Ghaziabad. Based on the finding of the inspection, the bank was issued 
operational instructions dated June 29, 2012 under Section 36 (1) of the Act. 
The statutory inspection conducted by the Reserve Bank of India under 
Section 35 of the Act with reference to the bank's financial position as on March 31, 
2012 revealed that many irregularities and violations which were pointed out in the 
previous inspections were persisting. The bank's assessed networth was                   
(-) ` 1424.74 lakh, Capital to Risk Assets Ratio was (-) 187.01% and gross NPAs 
were 61.70% of the gross advances. The bank's owned funds were totally wiped out, 
its deposit eroded to the extent of 100% and it incurred losses of ` 1727.50 lakh. 
Overdraft was allowed in a current account related to the former Chairman of the 
bank, which was regularised by opening dummy loan accounts and transferring the 
funds to the current account.  These dummy loan accounts were closed later by 
allowing overdrawals in the current accounts. By periodically resorting to such kite – 
flying, an amount of  `  1010.00 lakh had been siphoned off from the bank without 
any security thereagainst. 
A  bank guarantee of ` 500.00 lakh, issued against the security of Fixed 
Deposit Receipts (FDRs) of ` 300.00 lakh and ` 200.00 lakh, in favour of M/s 
Ashutosh Impex, New Delhi on behalf of M/s Vijay Cotton Trading Co., Patoda 
continued to be outstanding in the books of the bank. The bank allowed premature 
withdrawal of other three FDRs of ` 100.00 lakh each held as security against the 
above mentioned bank guarantee. An FDR of `  200 lakh in the name of M/s Vijay 
Cotton Trading Co. Patoda was issued by allowing overdraft in Current Account of 
Vijay Cotton Trading Co. on April 20, 2009. The FDR was closed prematurely on 
November 26, 2009. The proceeds along with interest for ` 203,57,643 were 
transferred to the current account of M/s Vijay Cotton Trading Co. to settle the 
overdraft. The bank did not have any record of the sanction letter as well as other 
relevant papers in this case. 
With a view to preventing preferential payment and protecting the interest of 
the depositors, the bank was placed under all inclusive directions for a period of six 
months from the close of business as on March 1, 2013 vide RBI directive dated 
February 28, 2013.   
A Show Cause Notice for cancellation of licence under Section 22 of the Act 
was issued to the bank  on April 9, 2013. The bank's reply dated May 6, 2013 was 
examined, considered and not found to be satisfactory. In view of the bank’s 
precarious financial position, chances of its revival were remote and continuation of 
the bank would be against public interest. The Reserve Bank of India, therefore, 
cancelled the licence of the bank in the interest of bank's depositors.
