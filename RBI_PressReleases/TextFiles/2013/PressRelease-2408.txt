aggregate foreign investment in the bank should also not exceed the composite 
sectoral cap of 74% as prescribed by the Government from time to time. The

No. FE.CO. FID /5330/ 11.01.091 /2010/11 dated August 30, 2010 may be treated as 
withdrawn. 
It is also advised that the existing prior approval applications for purchase of 
shares received through custodian banks of FIIs pending with Reserve Bank of India 
which could not be processed due to unavailability of limit/headroom, such investors 
are free to invest within the enhanced ceiling.

shares of the ING Vysya Bank Ltd. can now be purchased through primary market

paid-up equity capital of the bank.  It may be ensured that the investments made are 
within the stipulated ceilings.  The purchases should be made subject to the other 
terms and conditions stipulated by RBI.  
 The Reserve Bank will henceforth be monitoring the FII investments under 
Portfolio Investment Scheme (PIS) at sectoral cap/statutory ceiling as applicable and 
not the intermediate ceiling fixed by the above indicated bank.  It will be the ING 
Vysya Bank’s responsibility to ensure that the applicable cap is not breached.  The 
permission is being issued from FEMA angle only.  
 It may be noted that the present policy of Department of Banking Operations 
and Development (DBOD) requires RBI acknowledgement for acquisition / transfer of
