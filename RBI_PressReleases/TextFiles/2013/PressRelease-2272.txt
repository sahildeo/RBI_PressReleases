 Survey of India’s Foreign Liabilities and Assets for the  
Mutual Fund Companies – 2011-12  
The Reserve Bank of India today released, on its website, the data related to 
the results of Survey of India’s Foreign Liabilities and Assets for the Mutual Fund 
Companies – 2011-12. 
The data compiled are based on annual survey on India’s foreign liabilities and 
assets (FLA) of the mutual fund companies (MFs) and Asset Management Companies 
(AMCs) covering 44 companies which held/acquired foreign assets and/or liabilities 
(list in Annex). For the reference period March 2011-12, information was collected 
under Schedule 4 for MFs regarding units issued to non-residents, unpaid dividend, 
redemption of units issued to non-residents and MFs’ overseas investment and 
through FLA return for stock of external assets and liabilities of AMCs.  
Highlights:  
I. Mutual Fund Companies 
• Foreign liabilities of MFs, with two broad components (i) units issued to non-
residents and (ii) other foreign liabilities arising out of unpaid income/ dividend 
to non-residents, sale proceeds pending repatriation, etc. increased sharply 
from `214.2 billion in March 2011 to  `304.7 billion in March 2012. On the other 
hand, foreign assets of MFs declined from `47.3 billion in March 2011 to `38.3 
billion as at end-March 2012, as a consequence, their net liabilities increased 
from  `166.9 billion in March 2011 to `266.4 billion in March 2012.  
• Units issued to non-residents constituted the dominant component (99.8 per 
cent) of foreign liabilities of MFs in March 2012. The liabilities based on face 
value increased sharply from `213.4 billion in March 2011 to `304.0 billion in 
March 2012 whereas the liabilities based on market value increased from 
`405.4 billion in March 2011 to `504.0 billion in March 2012. 
• The share of United Arab Emirates (UAE) of the total foreign liabilities in March 
2012 increased substantially, whereas the shares of USA, Singapore and 
Oman, increased marginally during the reference period. 
• Equity investments held in overseas assets of MFs declined from `47.1 billion 
in March 2011 to `37.0 billion in March 2012. Overseas mutual fund units had a 
nominal share in portfolio assets; further, no MF invested in debt securities 
abroad. 
• Luxembourg (with share of 55.6 per cent in March 2012) accounted for the 
major share of the foreign portfolio assets of MFs. This was followed by the 
USA (15.8 per cent) and Hong Kong (6.5 per cent).

II. Asset Management Companies 
• Foreign liabilities of AMCs associated with the MFs increased from `25.0 billion 
in March 2011 to `28.5 billion by March 2012. On the other hand, their foreign 
assets declined from `1.7 billion in March 2011 to `1.4 billion in March 2012. As 
such, their net liabilities increased from `23.3 billion in March 2011 to `27.2 
billion in March 2012.  
• Mauritius accounted for the maximum share of foreign liabilities (34.4 per cent), 
followed by UK (19.6 per cent), Japan (7.1 per cent) and USA (6.9 per cent). 
• Singapore and Guernsey accounted for more than two third of the foreign 
assets portfolio of AMCs in March 2012. The share of the Guernsey’s in the 
foreign assets increased sharply from 16.6 per cent in March 2011 to 34.5 per 
cent in March 2012, whereas the share of the Mauritius declined from 15.1 per 
cent in March 2011 to 9.0 per cent in March 2012.  
• Reinvested earnings of the AMCs, which is estimated as the difference 
(positive or negative) between company’s net profit/loss and its distributed 
dividends, declined from `3.2 billion in 2010-11 to `2.9 billion in 2011-12 
reflecting the decreased profit earnings by the AMCs.
