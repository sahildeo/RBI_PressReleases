RBI releases Security and Risk Mitigation measures for  
Electronic Payment Transactions 
Payments effected through alternate payment products/channels are gaining 
traction among the customers, with more and more banks providing such facilities to 
their customers. In this scenario, it is imperative to ensure safety and security of such 
transactions effected through these channels. 
  Of late, there have been reports of frauds committed through the electronic 
payment channels and fraudulent usage of cards both at domestic and international 
locations. Even while the frauds reported are not alarming compared to the total 
transactions effected through these channels, RBI, has proactively engaged with the 
stakeholders to ensure the security of such transactions. One such initiative taken 
earlier was the mandating of additional factor of authentication for all card not present 
(CNP) transactions. Measures for security of card present (CP) transactions have 
also been initiated by RBI through the implementation of recommendations of the 
Working Group on Securing Card Present transactions.  
With cyber-attacks becoming more unpredictable, and fraudsters moving to 
new methods, banks are required to put in place certain minimum checks and 
balances to minimise the impact of such attacks and to arrest/mitigate the damage. 
However, in order to ensure that customers of banks are not vulnerable to such 
attacks, RBI has today issued new guidelines to the stakeholders to further 
strengthen the security and risk mitigation measures of cards and electronic banking 
transactions.
