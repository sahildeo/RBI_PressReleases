1. Flow of Funds Accounts of the Indian Economy: 2010-11 and 2011-12 
This article analyses the Flow of Funds accounts for the two fiscal years, 2010-
11 and 2011-12, along with revised/updated data for 2009-10. The previous article 
on Flow of Funds accounts which covered the fiscal years 2008-09 and 2009-10 was 
published in the December 2012 issue of the RBI Bulletin. The Flow of Funds 
accounts show the transactions in financial instruments between the major sectors of 
the economy on a ‘from whom-to-whom basis’.   
 
Main Findings: 
 
• The Indian economy rebounded strongly in 2009-10 and 2010-11 but lost 
momentum in 2011-12 on account of domestic and external factors. These 
factors impacted the sectoral and overall saving-investment gaps and the 
concomitant flow of funds across sectors.  
• The overall resource gap (or the current account deficit), as ratio to GDP, 
remained steady during 2010-11 but then increased in 2011-12. Underlying 
this was the widening of the resource gap of the public sector (after a one-off 
improvement in 2010-11) and the dwindling of the financial surplus of the 
household sector for the second consecutive year, even as the resource gap 
of the private corporate sector contracted after a temporary expansion in 
2010-11.  
• In line with the trends in economic activity, total financial claims issued by all 
the sectors, as ratio to net national income, increased in 2010-11 but declined 
in the following year, even as it was placed somewhat above the average 
during 2003-04 to 2007-08.  
• The composition of aggregate financial claims indicates that over the years, 
the banking sector has generally been predominant, followed by the private 
corporate business (PCB) sector, government sector, other financial 
institutions (OFI) sector, household sector and then the rest of the world 
(ROW) sector. During 2011-12, the claims issued (as a ratio to net national 
 
 
?nullnull???nullnullnull??2 
 
income) by the PCB, banking and the government sectors were higher than 
their respective averages during 2003-04 to 2007-08, while those issued by 
the ROW, household and the OFI sectors were lower. 
• The resource gap of the PCB sector has been predominantly financed by the 
ROW sector (largely through FDI and portfolio inflows and external 
commercial borrowings), followed by the OFI and banking sectors.   
• The banking and the OFI sectors continue to be the major providers of funds 
to the government sector in the recent period. 
• The financial surplus of the household sector has been largely channelised 
towards the banking sector, followed by the OFI sector (which includes 
insurance, mutual funds and provident funds). Household financing of the 
government sector has depleted over the years, largely reflecting the 
deflection from small savings.  
• Loans and advances have been the most preferred instruments for financial 
transactions across sectors, followed by currency and deposits. The share of 
government securities in total claims issued has generally increased reflecting 
preference for risk-free investment avenues apart from a substantial increase 
in the government’s funding requirements. On the other hand, the share of 
instruments of household financial saving i.e., small savings, life funds and 
provident and pension funds, has declined steadily. 
• The finance ratio, the financial inter-relations ratio and the new issues ratio 
have generally moved in tandem with the growth of the real economy.  
Accompanying Statements 1 to 8 on the flow of funds accounts are being web 
released simultaneously with this press release. The data on instrument-wise Flow of 
Funds accounts for each of the sectors are presented in Statements 1 to 6. The 
annual inter-sectoral flows are summarised in Statements 7.1 to 7.3. Instrument-wise 
financial flows are summarised for each year separately in Statements 8.1 to 8.3. 
 
2. Survey of Professional Forecasters 
Forecasts of key macroeconomic indicators, such as output growth and 
inflation, are important pre-requisites for forward-looking macroeconomic policy 
making. The Reserve Bank has been conducting the Survey of Professional 
Forecasters (SPF) since September 2007 at quarterly intervals.  
 
The survey asks around 40 forecasters in India and abroad to gauge their 
expectations in short-term to longer-term for macroeconomic indicators in real 
sector, monetary and banking sector, fiscal sector, financial markets and external 
sector in India. In this article, forecasts for the two financial years 2013-14 and 2014-
15 and for the next four quarters are presented. Also, the forecasts of implicit growth 
and inflation based on the probability distribution are examined.  
 
The weighted average forecasts, with weights based on the accuracy of past 
forecasts of individual forecasters, were found to be superior than the median based 
forecasts. 
 
3. Developments in India’s Balance of Payments during First Quarter (April-
June) of 2013-14 
This article provides details on developments in India’s balance of payments 
during April-June 2013 (Q1of 2013-14).

Main Findings: 
India’s external sector came under stress in Q1 of 2013-14 as current account 
deficit (CAD) worsened owing to the widening merchandise trade deficit and a slow 
recovery in net invisibles (income and services). Notwithstanding an increase in 
capital flows, particularly in FDI and bank loans, there was a marginal drawdown of 
foreign exchange reserves in Q1 of 2013-14. Major developments of BoP during the 
first quarter of 2013-14 are set out below. 
 
• India’s CAD worsened to US$ 21.8 billion in Q1 of 2013-14 from US$ 16.9 
billion in Q1 of 2012-13, primarily led by a burgeoning trade deficit. As a 
percentage of GDP, CAD worsened to 4.9 per cent in Q1 of 2013-14 from 
4 per cent in Q1 of 2012-13. 
• On a BoP basis, merchandise exports declined by 1.5 per cent to US$ 
73.9 billion in Q1 of 2013-14. In contrast, merchandise imports recorded 
an increase of 4.7 per cent at US$ 124.4 billion in Q1 of 2013-14 on 
account of a rise in POL and gold imports. 
• Net invisibles, however, recorded a growth of 7.2 per cent in Q1 of 2013-
14 as against a decline of 2.6 per cent in Q1 of 2012-13 on account of a 
rise in net export of services. 
• Notwithstanding a net outflow in portfolio investment, particularly from debt 
segment of FII, net inflows under capital and financial account (excluding 
changes in foreign exchange reserves) mainly on account of an increase 
in FDI and loans availed by banks were almost sufficient to finance the 
CAD. Nevertheless, there was a marginal drawdown of reserves of US$ 
0.3 billion in Q1 of 2013-14. 
 
4. India’s External Debt as at the end of June 2013 
With sharp widening of CAD during the first quarter of 2013-14 as compared 
to the preceding quarter and increased reliance on debt financing, external debt 
remained at an elevated level. However, the rise in external debt was more than fully 
offset by the valuation gains resulting from appreciation of the US dollar against 
other major currencies and against rupee. Therefore, during April-June 2013, there 
has been an absolute decline in the external debt in US dollar terms as compared to 
the preceding quarter. 
 
Main findings: 
 
• India’s external debt, as at end-June 2013, was placed at US$ 388.5 
billion showing a decline of US$ 3.6 billion or 0.9 per cent over the level at 
end-March 2013. Excluding the valuation gains, the external debt as at 
end-June would have increased by US$ 5.9 billion over end-March 2013. 
• In terms of major components, the share of commercial borrowings 
continued to be the highest at 30.7 per cent of total external debt, followed 
by short-term debt (24.9 per cent). The share of short-term debt in total 
debt, by original maturity, was 24.9 per cent. However, on residual 
maturity basis, short-term debt accounted for 43.8 per cent of the total 
external debt as at end-June 2013. 
• The ratio of short-term debt (original maturity) to foreign exchange 
reserves rose to 34.3 per cent as at end-June 2013 from 33.1 per cent as 
at end-March 2013. At end-June 2013, the foreign exchange cover to 
external debt was lower at 72.7 per cent as compared with 74.5 per cent at 
the end of March 2013. 4 
 
• The debt denominated in US dollar continued to be the highest with a 
share of 58.9 per cent in total external debt as at end-June 2013. 
 
5. South-West Monsoon 2013: A Review (June 1 to September 30, 2013) 
The South-West monsoon during June-September 2013 was 6 per cent 
above the long period average (LPA) of 89 cm (average of 1951-2000) as against 8 
per cent below LPA last year. This was 8 per cent higher than the India 
Meteorological Department (IMD) forecast of 98 per cent LPA for the season, and 
the highest margin by which the season’s precipitation has exceeded the LPA in the 
last nineteen years. Additionally, the monsoon has been accompanied by other 
favourable factors, namely, on time arrival and well distribution –spatially and 
temporally. These favourable factors have immensely benefited kharif sowing for 
2013 which has surpassed the area sown last year and its normal level. The result is 
higher estimated production of most kharif crops including foodgrains, pulses and 
oilseeds by 0.9 per cent, 1.7 per cent and 14.8 per cent, respectively, during 2013-14 
as per the first advance estimates which are expected to be revised upward as the 
season progresses. As regards rabi crops, with the reservoir levels continuing to be 
above normal and the previous year and the North-East monsoon so far turning out 
to be much above LPA, the prospect of a good harvest has improved. On the whole, 
the confluence of these favourable factors is expected to significantly boost 
agricultural growth prospects during 2013-14 to a level higher than the previous year.      
6. Remittances from Overseas Indians: Modes of Transfer, Transaction 
Cost and Time Taken 
This study is based on a sample survey of the bank branches across the 
major centres in India. This survey is done on a triennial basis. Similar survey was 
conducted earlier in July 2006 and November 2009 and the results of those surveys 
were published in November 2006 and April 2010 issues, respectively, of the RBI 
Bulletin. This study, based on the survey conducted during January-March 2013, 
reveals the following important dimensions of inward remittances from overseas 
Indians. 
 
Main findings: 
 
• While electronic wires/SWIFT continue to be the dominant mode of 
transferring remittances by the overseas Indians, in the recent period, 
there has been a significant increase in the share of remittances 
transmitted through direct transfer to bank accounts and through on-line 
mode. 
• Out of the total remittance transfers to India, the high value remittances 
(`50,000 and above) accounted for 63 per cent of the total value of 
remittance inflows. 
• The cost of remittances across various modes of transfer has moderated 
over the years reflecting increasing competition and introduction of fast 
money transferring infrastructure. 
• The major sources of remittances are Gulf countries and North America 
accounting around 37 per cent and 34 per cent of total remittances, 
respectively. Major portion of remittances to India is dollar denominated 
(57 per cent) followed by Saudi Riyal/UAE Dirham (16 per cent). 
• A predominant portion of the remittances received (49 per cent) is utilised 
for family maintenance. The share of remittances for investment has 
gradually increased. 5
