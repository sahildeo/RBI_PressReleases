Finances of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) Companies, 2011-12 -  
Data Release 
 The Reserve Bank of India today released on its website, data related to 
Finances of Non-Government Non-Financial (NGNF) Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) 
Companies, 2011-12 based on audited annual accounts of select 766 companies 
which closed their accounts during April 2011 and March 2012. The study includes 
715 companies covered in the regular studies on finances of non-government non-
financial (NGNF) public/private limited companies for the year 2011-12 published 
earlier and 51 additional FDI companies. It provides a comparative picture over the 
three-year period 2009-10 to 2011-12. ‘Explanatory notes’ on data are given at the 
end.  
Main Findings: 
• Growth in sales of select FDI companies at the aggregate level improved 
marginally in 2011-12. Higher growth in operating expenses than that of value 
of production (VoP) led to decline in earnings before interest, tax depreciation 
and amortisation (EBITDA). 
• Steep rise in interest payments in 2011-12 resulted in decline in net profit 
(PAT). Gross savings of select FDI companies contracted further in 2011-12.  
• Profit margin of the select companies also declined in 2011-12. 
• Sales growth of FDI companies belonging to services sector improved in 
2011-12 over that in the previous year, while it declined for those in the 
manufacturing sector. 
• EBITDA for the manufacturing sector declined in 2011-12, whereas for the 
services sector, EBITDA growth registered an increase. 
• EBITDA growth was low or negative in most of the industries in the 
manufacturing sector. In the services sector ‘computer and related activities’ 
and ‘transport and storage service’ industries led to higher growth in EBITDA. 
• Total net assets of select companies grew at a lower rate in 2011-12, both in 
manufacturing and services sectors. 
•  Net worth of select companies grew at a lower rate in 2011-12, consequent 
on lower profit growth. 
• Total borrowing of selected companies also grew at a lower rate in 2011-12 as 
compared with 2010-11. However, select companies in manufacturing sector 
had marginally higher growth in borrowings.

• Debt (which generally represents the long term component of the borrowings) 
to equity ratio of the select companies declined marginally in 2011-12.  
• The external sources (i.e., other than companies’ own funds) continued to play 
a major role in business expansion of the select FDI companies in 2011-12. 
Share of gross fixed asset formation in uses of funds remained similar to the 
previous year’s level. 
An article analysing the performance of select FDI companies at the aggregate 
level as well as based on share of FDI, country of origin of FDI and industry, covering 
a longer period will be published in the January 2014 issue of the RBI Bulletin.
