Authorisation under the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007 - 
Tata Communications Payment Solutions Limited, Mumbai 
 
Tata Communications Payment Solutions Limited, Mumbai; a subsidiary of 
Tata Communications Limited, has been issued Certificate of Authorisation by the 
Reserve Bank for setting up and operating White Label ATMs (WLAs) in India. 
  
Earlier in June 2012, the Reserve Bank of India had issued policy guidelines 
permitting non-bank entities to set up and operate WLAs in the country after seeking 
Authorisation under the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007. Hitherto, only 
banks were permitted to set up and operate ATMs in India. The primary objective of 
permitting non-banks to operate WLAs was to enhance the spread of ATMs in semi-
urban and rural areas (mainly tier III to VI cities/towns), where bank owned ATM 
penetration was not growing. Under the new guidelines, certain minimum number of 
WLAs need to be installed in these areas within a year as per the Scheme opted.
