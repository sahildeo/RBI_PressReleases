Swap Facility for Expansion of Export Credit in Foreign Currency 
 
With a view to further enhancing the flow of credit to the export sector, the 
Reserve Bank of India has introduced a US Dollar-Rupee swap facility to support 
incremental Pre-shipment Export Credit in Foreign Currency (PCFC) by banks. 
Scheduled banks (excluding Regional Rural Banks (RRBs)) will have the option to 
access rupee refinance to the extent of the swap with the Reserve Bank under a 
special export credit refinance facility.  
 
The swap facility will be available to scheduled banks (excluding RRBs) from 
January 21, 2013 till June 28, 2013 for fixed tenor of 3/6 months. During any particular 
month, the maximum amount of US dollars that banks would be eligible to avail of 
from the Reserve Bank through swaps would be equal to the incremental PCFC 
disbursed with reference to a base date (November 30, 2012), subject to a limit. The 
limits would be communicated to eligible individual banks separately. The limits would 
be reviewed periodically based on actual utilisation and other relevant factors. The 
overall cap for the banking system works out to US Dollar 6.5 billion.  
 
Under the swap arrangement, a bank can buy US Dollars up to its eligible swap 
limit from the Reserve Bank and simultaneously sell the same amount of US Dollars 
forward as per the term of the swap at the prevailing market rates for swaps of similar 
tenor. At the end of the swap term, the bank will exchange with the Reserve Bank, the 
US Dollars against the rupees. The Reserve Bank’s decision regarding the pricing of 
the swap shall be final and no request for any modification/revision to the same would 
be entertained. 
 
The swap facility will be operationalised by the Financial Markets Department 
of the Reserve Bank at Mumbai. Depending upon the prevailing market conditions, 
and other relevant factors, the Reserve Bank would exercise the right to decide on the 
day of operation, the number of banks that can avail of the facility on any particular 
day, the maximum amount of swap that the Reserve Bank would undertake with the 
banks on any particular day and the maximum quantum of swap that each bank can 
do on any particular day.  
 
The new facility comes into effect on January 21, 2013. Eligible banks can 
approach the Financial Markets Department by e-mail with their request for US Dollar 
swaps indicating the amount of US Dollars and tenor (3 month or 6 month).
