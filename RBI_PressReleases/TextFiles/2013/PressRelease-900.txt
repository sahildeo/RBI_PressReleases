RBI releases Discussion Paper on ‘Banking Structure in India - 
 The Way Forward’ 
The Reserve Bank of India today released on its website a Discussion Paper 
on ‘Banking Structure in India – The Way Forward’.   
The Discussion paper has identified certain building blocks for the 
reorientation of the banking structure with a view to addressing various issues such 
as enhancing competition, financing higher growth, providing specialised services 
and furthering financial inclusion.  It has also emphasised the need to address the 
concerns arising out of such changes with a view to managing the trade off for 
ensuring financial stability. The envisaged policy will have to be in the backdrop of a 
strong regulatory and supervisory regime with increased intensity of supervision for 
the systemically important banks.  The overall thrust of the reorientation is to impart 
dynamism and flexibility to the evolving banking structure, while ensuring that the 
structure remains resilient and promotes financial stability. 
The important issues covered in the Discussion Paper are: 
i) Small banks vs. large banks :  Small local banks play an important role in 
the supply of credit to small enterprises and agriculture and banking services 
in unbanked and under-banked regions in the country. While permitting large 
number of small banks, however, the issues relating to their size, numbers, 
capital requirements, exposure norms, regulatory prescriptions, corporate 
governance and resolution need to be suitably addressed. 
ii) Universal Banking: Universal banking model remains the dominant and 
preferred model in most of the post crisis world, given the failure of many 
investment banks during the crisis. Under the universal banking model, the 
Financial Holding Company (FHC) structure has distinct advantages and may 
be a preferred model. Additionally, in a changing economic environment, there 
is a need for niche banking and differentiated licensing could be a desirable 
step in this direction, particularly for infrastructure financing, wholesale 
banking and retail banking. There is also a need to promote investment 
banks/investment banking activities.  
iii) Continuous Authorisation:   There is a case for reviewing the current  ‘Stop 
and Go’ licensing policy and consider adopting a ‘continuous authorisation’ 
policy, as continuous authorisation keeps the competitive pressure on the 
existing banks and also does not strain the banking system as the ‘block’ 
licensing may do. However, it is important that the entry norms should be 
stringent so as to encourage entry by only well-qualified entities in order to 
improve the quality of the banking system and promote competition.

iv) Conversion of UCBs into commercial banks:  There is a case of exploring 
the possibilities of converting some UCBs into commercial banks or small 
banks as these banks, freed from dual control and with more avenues to raise 
capital, could extend banking services in the regions characterised by poor 
banking outreach. 
v) Consolidation: The issue of consolidation in the banking sector has assumed 
significance, considering the need for a few Indian banks to cater to global 
needs by becoming global players and the growing corporate and 
infrastructure funding needs. Taking into account the pros and cons of 
consolidation, it has to be borne in mind that while consolidation of commercial 
banks with established synergies and on the basis of voluntary initiatives is 
welcome, it cannot be imposed on banks.  A measured approach is to be 
made both on consolidation and global presence even if attaining global size is 
not imminent.  
vi) Presence of Foreign Banks in India:  The significance and need for foreign 
banks’ participation in India arises primarily to increase competition, promote 
efficiency of the local banking system and also to bring in sophisticated 
financial services and risk management methodologies which can be adopted 
by the domestic banks. Post crisis, domestic incorporation of foreign banks 
through the subsidiarisation route has acquired importance.   
vii) Indian banks’ presence overseas: Given the highly competitive environment 
overseas coupled with enhanced regulation, the way forward for the Indian 
banks could be, apart from Representative Office and branch form of presence 
overseas, local incorporation by large banks either individually or in joint 
venture mode with other banks or with overseas banks. This will enable the 
large Indian banks to engage in a much wider range of activities and have 
greater potential for growth.  Eventually, this may facilitate banks increasing 
their global reach.    
viii) Government Ownership: An optimal ownership mix in the banking sector is 
required to promote a balance between efficiency, equity and financial 
stability.  Going forward, there is a better pay-off   in enabling PSBs to improve 
their performance while promoting private sector banks.  As regards the 
reduction in fiscal burden on account of recapitalisation of the Public Sector 
Banks (PSBs), Government may consider options from menu of choices 
available such as issue of non-voting equity shares or differential voting equity 
shares, adopting FHC structure or diluting stake in PSBs.   
ix) Deposit Insurance and resolution: The existence of an effective resolution 
regime is essential for any type of banking structure India may pursue. The 
FSB key attributes could be the guiding principles for setting up a resolution 
framework in India.  
x) Indicative reorientation of the banking structure: The reoriented banking 
structure would comprise four tiers.  The first tier may consist of three or four 
large Indian banks with domestic and international presence along with 
branches of foreign banks in India. The second tier is likely to comprise 
several mid-sized banking institutions including niche banks with economy-
wide presence.  The third tier may encompass old private sector banks, 
Regional Rural Banks, and multi state Urban Cooperative Banks.  The fourth 
tier may embrace many small privately owned local banks and cooperative 
banks. 3

Background 
Exercises to review the banking systems have been taken up by many 
jurisdictions especially in the aftermath of the global financial crisis incorporating 
lessons learnt from the crisis.  While the primary motivation of the current exercise in 
reviewing the banking structure in India is to put forth various options to enable the 
banking system to cater to the needs of a growing and increasingly globalising 
economy, providing specialised services and deepening financial inclusion, the 
lessons learnt from the crisis are suitably taken into consideration, despite Indian 
banking system coming out relatively unscathed from the crisis.  
A number of studies have sought to examine whether the nature of the 
banking structure matters for the economic growth of a country.  While there is no 
broad consensus on the issue, it can be reasonably agreed that a dynamic and 
flexible banking system would be more equipped to address the requirements of a 
dynamic economy.   
Against this background the Reserve Bank of India issued guidelines for 
licensing of new banks in the private sector, vide its press release dated February 22, 
2013.  It was stated in the guidelines that there was a need for an explicit policy on 
banking structure in India, keeping in view the recommendations of the Narasimham 
Committee, Raghuram Rajan Committee and other viewpoints. Accordingly, it was 
announced in the Monetary Policy Statement 2013-14 on May 03, 2013 that the 
Discussion Paper on ‘Banking Structure in India – The Way Forward’ would be 
issued.
