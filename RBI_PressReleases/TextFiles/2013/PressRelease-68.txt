RBI Working Paper Series 11:  
Non Deliverable Forwards and Onshore Indian Rupee Market: 
A Study on Inter-linkages 
The Reserve Bank of India, today placed on its website, a Working Paper titled 
Non Deliverable Forward (NDF) and Onshore Indian Rupee Market: A Study on Inter-
“
linkages” under the Reserve Bank of India Working Paper Series. The paper has been 
authored by Rajan Goyal, Rajeev Jain and Soumasree Tewari. 
In this paper, the authors have examined the inter-linkages of onshore segments 
of India’s foreign exchange market with NDF market for Indian rupee (INR). Sample 
period of the study from June 6, 2006 to April 3, 2013, has been divided into four sub-
periods based on appreciating/depreciating trend in INR. To examine the direction of 
transmission between onshore and NDF markets, vector error correction model and 
ARCH/GARCH models are used.  
Major findings of the paper are: 
• A long term relationship exists between onshore and NDF markets and the 
relationship is bidirectional as both markets adjust to any deviation from 
equilibrium state. However, bidirectional relationship turns unidirectional from NDF 
to onshore during the period when rupee comes under downward pressure.  
• ARCH/GARCH models also confirm broadly the same dynamics of inter-
relationship through cross-mean and volatility spillover between NDF and onshore 
markets.  
• While both mean and volatility spillover from NDF market to onshore market and 
from onshore to NDF market are found to be statistically significant during the 
period of rupee appreciation, the volatility spillover turns unidirectional from NDF 
to onshore market during the period of rupee depreciation.  
• Even though both onshore and offshore segments follow an equilibrium 
relationship in the long-run, movements in NDF market seem to drive adjustment 
in onshore market when rupee faces downward pressure.
