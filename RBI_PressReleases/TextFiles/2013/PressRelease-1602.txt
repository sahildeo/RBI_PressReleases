RBI and  select branches of Banks to accept Advance Income Tax 
 It is observed that the rush for remitting Income Tax dues through the 
Reserve Bank of India is quite heavy towards the end of June month. It becomes 
difficult for the Bank to cope with the pressure of receipts although additional 
counters to the maximum possible extent are provided for the purpose. 
Consequently, the members of public are required to wait in queues at the Bank for 
unnecessarily long periods. To obviate the inconvenience involved, assessees are 
advised to avoid last minute rush by remitting their Income Tax dues sufficiently in 
advance of the due date.   
 The Reserve Bank has also authorized  select branches of accredited agency 
banks as indicated below at Mumbai to accept payments of Income Tax dues. Most 
of these banks are also providing facilities for on-line payment of taxes. The 
assessees may take advantage of these arrangements for their convenience.
