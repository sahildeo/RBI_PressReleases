RBI penalises Axis Bank, HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank  
The Reserve Bank has imposed a monetary penalty on Axis Bank, HDFC 
Bank and ICICI Bank for violating Reserve Bank of India instructions. The details of 
the penalty are:  
Bank Penalty amount (`  in lakh) 
Axis Bank Ltd. 500.10 
HDFC Bank Ltd. 450.00 
ICICI Bank Ltd. 100.10 
The penalties have been imposed in exercise of powers vested in the Reserve 
Bank under the provisions of Section 47(A)(1)( c ) read with Section 46(4)(i) of the 
Banking Regulation Act, 1949, 
It may be recalled that the Reserve Bank of India had carried out a scrutiny of 
books of accounts, internal control, compliance systems and processes of these 
three banks at their corporate offices and some branches during March / April 2013 
to investigate into the allegations of contravention of KYC/AML guidelines against 
them. The scrutiny of these three banks revealed violation of certain regulations and 
instructions issued by Reserve Bank of India, namely, 
• non-observance of certain safeguards in respect of arrangement of “at par” 
payment of cheques drawn by cooperative banks,  
• non-adherence to certain aspects of know your customer (KYC) norms and 
anti money laundering (AML) guidelines like risk categorisation and 
periodical review of risk profiling of account holders, 
• Non-adherence of  KYC  for walk in customers including for sale of third 
party products, omission in filing of cash transaction reports (CTRs) in 
respect of some cash transactions, sale of gold coins for cash beyond Rs. 
50000, 
• not-obtaining of permanent account number (PAN) card details or form 
60/61 as required,  
• non-verification of source of funds credited to a few non-resident ordinary 
(NRO) accounts,  
• failure to re-designate a few accounts as NRO accounts though required, 
non-submission of proper information called for by the reserve Bank, etc.

The investigation did not reveal any prima facie evidence of money laundering.  
However, any conclusive inference in this regard can be drawn only by an end to end 
investigation of the transactions by tax and enforcement agencies. 
Based on the findings of the scrutiny, the Reserve Bank issued a show cause 
notice to each of these banks, in response to which the individual banks submitted 
written replies. After considering the facts of each case and individual bank’s reply, 
as also, personal submissions, information submitted and documents furnished, the 
Reserve Bank came to the conclusion that some of the violations were substantiated 
and warranted imposition of monetary penalty as determined above. 
A similar scrutiny was also conducted at the corporate offices of 36 other 
banks during April and May 2013. The process of follow up action in respect of these 
banks is at different stages of its completion.
