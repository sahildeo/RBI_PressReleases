Check before Depositing Money with Financial Entities: RBI Advisory  
 
The Reserve Bank of India has today issued an advisory to members of public urging 
them to carefully evaluate their investment decisions, including making deposit with NBFCs. 
The advisory is part of the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) issued by the central bank. 
The FAQs explain in detail the various kinds of financial entities and the regulations 
governing them. They also list where members of public can lodge complaints in case some 
financial entity is found to be conducting business unauthorisedly or does not repay the 
deposits.   
 
The FAQs, for instance, state that the Reserve Bank regulates Non-Bank Financial 
Companies that conduct financial activity as their principal business; it has authorised only a 
few Non-bank Financial Companies to accept deposits; all incorporated entities must 
necessarily be authorised to collect deposits either under the Reserve Bank of India Act 
1934 or under the Companies Act, 1956; and it does not regulate chit fund activities or 
Collective Investment Schemes (CIS).  
 
The FAQs also state that a detailed list of NBFCs authorised by the Reserve Bank to 
accept deposits is available on the RBI website (www.rbi.org.in ? Sitemap ? NBFC List ? 
List of NBFCs Permitted to Accept Deposits) and has advised the members of public to 
check the list before placing deposits with Non-Banking Financial Companies.   
 
The Reserve Bank has been, on several occasions in the past, through press 
releases and through its outreach and sensitisation programmes conducted by its Regional 
Offices, cautioning the general public not to fall prey to fictitious offers promising 
unsustainable returns by individuals, unincorporated bodies and companies.   
 
The RBI FAQs also advise members of public to immediately register their 
complaints in case they notice any company accepting deposits unauthorisedly or not 
repaying the principal and/or interest with the local police or with the Economic Offences 
Wing of the State Police and in case the entity is a company, to register their complaints with 
the Registrar of Companies.   
 
 
RBI Advisory on What* to check before making deposits with NBFCs 
 
A depositor wanting to place deposit with an NBFC must ensure that : 
 
The NBFC is registered with RBI and is specifically authorised to accept deposits. 
This can be checked from the list of deposit taking NBFCs published on the RBI 
website - www.rbi.org.in ? Sitemap ? NBFC List.  The depositor should check the 
list of NBFCs permitted to accept public deposits and also check that it is not 
appearing in the list of companies prohibited from accepting deposits. 
 
NBFCs have to prominently display the Certificate of Registration (CoR) issued by 
the Reserve Bank on its site. If an NBFC is authorised to accept public deposit, the 
certificate reflects that.  
 
 
????? ??????????????2 
 
RBI does not guarantee the repayment of deposits accepted by NBFCs 
 
NBFCs cannot use the name of the RBI in any manner while conducting their 
business 
 
Currently, the maximum interest rate that an NBFC can pay to a depositor should not 
exceed 12.5%. The Reserve Bank, however, keeps changing these interest rates 
depending on the macro-economic environment. The Reserve Bank publishes the 
change in the interest rates on www.rbi.org.in ? Sitemap ? NBFC List ? FAQs. 
 
The depositor must insist on a proper receipt for every amount of deposit placed with 
the company. The receipt should be duly signed by an officer authorised by the 
company and should state the date of the deposit, the name of the depositor, the 
amount in words and figures, rate of interest payable, maturity date and amount.  
 
Investors must generally be circumspect if the interest rates or rates of return on 
investments offered are higher than those offered by others in the market place. 
Unless the entity accepting funds is able to earn more than what it promises, the 
entity will not be able to repay the investor as promised. For earning higher returns, 
the entity will have to take higher risks on the investments it makes. Higher risk could 
mean undertaking speculative activities and on such activities, there can be no 
assured return. As such, the public should forewarn themselves that the likelihood of 
losing money in schemes that offer high rates of interest are more. Still, if they want 
to invest in schemes that promise high rates of return, investors must ensure that the 
entity offering such returns is registered with one of the financial sector regulators 
and is authorised to accept funds, whether in the form of deposits or otherwise.
