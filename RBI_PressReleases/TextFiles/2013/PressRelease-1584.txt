RBI holds Annual Conference of State Finance Secretaries 
The 26th Conference of the State Finance Secretaries was held in the 
Reserve Bank of India at Mumbai today. Finance Secretaries of 26 States 
participated. Dr. D.Subbarao, Governor, Reserve Bank of India inaugurated the 
th
Conference. Dr. Y.V. Reddy, Chairman, 14 Finance Commission also participated. 
Dr. K.C Chakrabarty, Shri Anand Sinha, Shri H.R Khan and Dr. Urjit R Patel, Deputy 
Governors and other senior officials of the Ministry of Finance, Government of India 
and the Reserve Bank attended the Conference. 
The Governor highlighted that notwithstanding lower budgeted Gross Fiscal 
Deficit, managing debt issuance will be challenge due to increased size of borrowing, 
inflation risk, banks holding excess SLR and expected pickup in demand for private 
credit in later part of the year. Governor urged that States have to explore ways for 
better cash management, adequate information dissemination on State finances etc.  
The Governor felt that the global arguments on debt sustainability and fiscal 
austerity need to be examined in the Indian context. The RBI will be doing a study on 
Indian sub-national debt sustainability to understand the dynamics of the problem. 
He also felt that the quality of fiscal consolidation is important and States should 
focus more on expenditure compression. 
States have a critical role to play in inflation management as they are 
important stakeholders in eliminating supply constraints in the economy. They could 
address the supply constraints by increasing productivity in agriculture, improving 
infrastructure especially rural infrastructure, streamlining public distribution system 
and addressing governance concerns to create enabling environment for investment.  
He also stressed on coordination between the State Governments and all 
other stake holders for increased surveillance at ground level in matters relating to 
financial inclusion as also for matters relating to chit funds & ponzi schemes and 
multilevel marketing schemes. 
Other issues discussed included the projected market borrowings of the State 
Governments for 2013-14, effective cash flow projection by States, strengthening of 
Consolidated Sinking Fund/Guarantee Redemption Fund, migration of State 
Government business receipt/payment to electronic mode, recent instances of 
unauthorised deposit acceptance by unscrupulous entities and role of State 
Governments in customer education and awareness.
