RBI releases its Monthly Bulletin for November 2013 
The Reserve Bank of India today released the November 2013 issue of its 
monthly Bulletin. The Bulletin includes one special article: Finances of Non-
Government Non-Financial Private Limited Companies, 2011-12. The article 
analyses the financial performance of select 1,741 non-government non-financial 
(NGNF) private limited companies during 2011-12, based on their audited annual 
accounts. It also draws a comparative picture over the five year period from 2007-08 
to 2011-12 based on the previous studies on private limited companies published 
earlier. 
Main Findings: 
• Growth in sales of select NGNF private limited companies moderated in 2011-
12 following the recovery in 2010-11, across manufacturing and services 
sectors. Higher growth in operating expenses than that of value of production 
led to lower growth in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and 
amortisation (EBITDA). Rise in interest payments in 2011-12 resulted in lower 
net profit. 
• EBITDA growth of most of the industries in manufacturing sector was low or 
negative in 2011-12, whereas in the services sector it remained high as the 
sector could contain growth in its operating expenses.  
• Total net assets of select companies grew at a much lower rate in 2011-12. 
Slower pace of expansion was observed in all the major sectors viz., 
manufacturing, services and construction. It was also spread across most of 
the industries and across companies in different sales-size classes. 
• The borrowings to equity ratio, at aggregate level, which declined during 2010-
11 increased in 2011-12. Debt to equity ratio also increased in 2011-12. The 
increase was observed mostly in services sector industries. 
• The interest coverage ratio (EBIT to interest ratio) at the aggregate level 
registered a significant decline in 2011-12 and reached the lowest level during 
the last five years.
