Assurance on Liquidity Management 
 
Beginning with the Mid-Quarter Review of September 2013, the Reserve Bank 
of India began a calibrated unwinding of the exceptional measures undertaken since 
July so as to restore normalcy to financial flows. Currently, the Reserve Bank is 
injecting about Rs 1.5 trillion into the system on a daily basis through the liquidity 
adjustment facility (LAF), the export credit refinance facility (ECR) and the marginal 
standing facility (MSF) taken together. Nevertheless, liquidity conditions have been 
tightening as reflected in the hardening of yields in the government securities market 
due to uncertainties around the Government borrowing programme for the second 
half of 2013-14 as well as the prospective effects of banks’ half-yearly account 
closure, the seasonal pick-up in credit demand, festival-related demand for currency 
and sluggish deposit growth. The Reserve Bank is closely and continuously 
monitoring liquidity conditions and will take actions as appropriate, including open 
market operations, to ensure that adequate liquidity is available to support the flow of 
credit to productive sectors of the economy.
