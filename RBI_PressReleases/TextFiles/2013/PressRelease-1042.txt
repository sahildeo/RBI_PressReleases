RBI Study on Impact of Real Interest Rate on Growth and Investment 
While lower real interest rates can stimulate growth and investment, central 
bank cannot adopt a policy of higher inflation tolerance as the means to lower real 
rates because beyond a threshold the negative impact of inflation on growth 
outweighs its positive impact through lower real interest rate.  This was the 
conclusion of a study undertaken by the Reserve Bank of India.  
 
The study titled  “Real Interest Rate Impact on Investment and Growth –  What 
the Empirical Evidence for India Suggests?”, examined the broad question that 
higher inflation tolerance is a convenient means to lower real interest rate; but should 
a central bank pursue such a path? The study was initiated in the backdrop of the 
difficult growth-inflation mix encountered in 2012-13, when persistently high inflation 
required resolute anti-inflationary thrust in the conduct of monetary policy on the one 
hand, and sluggish growth impulses warranted adequate and unambiguous monetary 
policy stimulus to spur growth on the other.  
 
Monetary policy is often expected to adopt a pro-growth stance in a phase of 
prolonged slowdown in growth and sluggish investment activities, notwithstanding 
persisting risks to inflation and the external balance position. Since real activities are 
believed to be sensitive to changes in real interest rates, a central bank is expected 
to aim at ensuring a lower real interest rate - rather than a lower nominal interest rate 
-  when it shifts the balance of policy focus from primarily anti-inflationary to primarily 
pro-growth.   
 
Major findings of the study are: 
 
? For the determination of growth and investment at the macroeconomic level 
the real interest rate is more relevant, even though the nominal interest rate is 
important for investment planning at the firm level. 
 
? At the macroeconomic level, with rising incremental capital output ratio, the 
marginal productivity of capital has declined over successive quarters in last 
two years, indicating why a lower interest rate alone may not stimulate growth.  
 
? At the firm level, both nominal expected cash flows from an investment project 
and the nominal hurdle rate would invariably presume some underlying 
inflation expectations, but neither cash flows nor the hurdle rate may be 
explicitly evaluated in real terms.

? Over different phases of the business cycle, the internal rate of return (IRR) 
and the hurdle rate change, and therefore the nominal interest rate should be 
compared with the IRR, rather than relative to a level prevailing in the past, to 
assess whether the interest rate environment is growth supportive.  
 
? In a dampened investment climate, the IRR of firms may remain under 
constant pressure, as corporates face cash flow problems due to sluggish 
demand conditions, weak pricing power, high input costs, stalled projects at 
different levels of completion, and delays in collection of receivables after 
delivery of orders. In a phase of falling IRR, the interest rate must decline 
significantly to ensure that the hurdle rate remains below the falling IRR to be 
able to revive investment and growth.   
 
? A central bank can influence real interest rates through financial 
repression/reforms and lagged monetary policy response to inflation. Real 
interest rate is a real phenomenon, but it could change in the short-run 
depending on how monetary policy responds to inflation and inflation 
expectations. 
 
? Empirical estimates using both firm-level and macroeconomic data, and 
alternative methodologies  such as panel regression, VAR, Quantile 
regression and simple OLS suggest  that for 100 bps increase in real interest 
rate, investment rate may decline by about 50 bps and GDP growth may 
moderate by about 20 bps.
