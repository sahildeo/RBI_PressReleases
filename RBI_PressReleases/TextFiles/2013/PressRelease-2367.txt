RBI Releases Draft Guidelines on 
Capital requirements for bank exposures to central counterparties 
 
The Reserve Bank of India today released on its website, Draft Guidelines on 
‘Capital requirements for bank exposures to central counterparties’ for comments and 
feedback. 
 
Comments/feedback on the draft guidelines may be sent by January 31, 2013 
to the Chief General Manager-in-Charge, Department of Banking Operations and

Background 
The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) had issued an interim 
framework for determining capital requirements for bank exposures to CCPs in July 
2012. This framework is being introduced as an amendment to the existing Basel II 
capital adequacy framework and is intended to create incentives to increase the use 
of Central Counter Parties (CCPs). Accordingly, it was announced in the second 
quarter review of the monetary policy for 2012-13 to issue draft guidelines on capital 
requirements for bank exposures to central counterparties, based on the interim 
framework of the BCBS, by mid-November 2012.
