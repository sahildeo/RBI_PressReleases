RBI releases Discussion Paper on Framework for Revitalising Distressed 
Assets in the Economy 
The Reserve Bank of India today released on its website a Discussion Paper 
on ‘Early Recognition of Financial Distress, Prompt Steps for Resolution and Fair 
Recovery for Lenders: Framework for Revitalising Distressed Assets in the 
Economy’. Comments on the Discussion Paper may be sent to the Principal Chief 
General Manager, Reserve Bank of India, Department of Banking Operations and 
th
Development, Central Office, 12 Floor, Central Office Building, Shahid Bhagat Singh 
Marg, Mumbai-400 001 or emailed by January 1, 2014.  
The Discussion Paper outlines a corrective action plan that will incentivize 
early identification of problem cases, timely restructuring of accounts which are 
considered to be viable, and taking prompt steps by banks for recovery or sale of 
unviable accounts. The main proposals in the Discussion Paper are summarised 
below: 
Summary of Proposals 
(i) Early formation of a lenders’ committee with timelines to agree to a plan for 
resolution. 
(ii) Incentives for lenders to agree collectively and quickly to a plan – better 
regulatory treatment of stressed assets if a resolution plan is underway, 
accelerated provisioning if no agreement can be reached.  
(iii) Improvement in current restructuring process: Independent evaluation of large 
value restructurings mandated, with a focus on viable plans and a fair sharing 
of losses (and future possible upside) between promoters and creditors. 
(iv)  More expensive future borrowing for borrowers who do not co-operate with 
lenders in resolution. 
(v)  More liberal regulatory treatment of asset sales  
a. Lender can spread loss on sale over two years provided loss is fully 
disclosed.  
b. Takeout financing/refinancing possible over a longer period and will not be 
construed as restructuring. 
c. Leveraged buyouts will be allowed for specialised entities for acquisition of 
‘stressed companies’.

d. Steps to enable better functioning of Asset Reconstruction Companies 
mooted.  
e. Sector-specific Companies/Private equity firms encouraged to play active 
role in stressed assets market. 
Background 
With the slowdown of the Indian economy, a number of companies/projects 
are under stress. As a result, the Indian banking system has seen increase in NPAs 
and restructured accounts during the recent years. Not only do financially distressed 
assets produce less than economically possible, they also deteriorate quickly in 
value. Therefore, there is a need to ensure that the banking system recognises 
financial distress early, takes prompt steps to resolve it, and ensures fair recovery for 
lenders and investors. ‘Improving the system’s ability to deal with corporate distress 
and financial institution distress by strengthening real and financial restructuring as 
well as debt recovery’ has been indicated by the Governor, RBI as one of the five 
pillars on which Reserve Bank’s developmental measures will be built for improving 
the financial system over the next few quarters. This Discussion Paper is a step in 
that direction.
