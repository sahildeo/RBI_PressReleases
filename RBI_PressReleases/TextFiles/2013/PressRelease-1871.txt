The Reserve Bank has, however, clarified, that issue of the Directions by the

business but with restrictions till its financial position improves. The Reserve Bank 
may consider modifications of these Directions depending upon circumstances.  
The Reserve Bank has issued these Directions in exercise of powers vested in
