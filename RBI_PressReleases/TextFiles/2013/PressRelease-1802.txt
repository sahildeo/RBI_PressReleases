The Reserve Bank of India has imposed a monetary penalty of `5.00 lakh 
(Rupees Five Lakh only) on the Vasantdada Nagari Sahakari Bank Ltd. Osmanabad, 
in exercise of the powers vested in it under the provisions of Section 47A(1)(b) read 
with Section 46(4) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (As applicable to Co-
operative Societies), for violation of the directives / guidelines of the Reserve Bank of 
India on maximum limit on unsecured advances, sanctioning loans and advances to 
the firms in which the directors and their relatives were interested and not following 
the Income Recognition, Asset Classification and Provisioning norms.

the case and the bank’s reply in the matter, the Reserve Bank came to the 
conclusion that the violations were substantiated and warranted imposition of the
