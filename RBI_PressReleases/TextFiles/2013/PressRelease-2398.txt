RBI sets up a Working Group to Review Banking Ombudsman Scheme 
 Apropos the recommendations of the Committee on Customer Service in Banks 
(Damodaran Committee) pertaining to Banking Ombudsman Scheme 2006 and the 
Rajya Sabha Committee on Subordinate Legislation, a Working Group (Chairperson: 
Smt. Suma Varma) has been constituted in the Reserve Bank of India to review, 
update, and revise the Banking Ombudsman Scheme, 2006.  This was revealed in the 
Annual Report of the Banking Ombudsman Scheme, 2011-12 published here today by 
the Reserve Bank of India.  
 Presenting a brief review of the operations of the Banking Ombudsman 
Scheme, the Annual Report said that the total number of customer complaints 
received in Banking Ombudsman's (BO) offices of the Reserve Bank of India stood at 
72,889 in 2011-12. Last year, the BO offices received 71,274 complaints. Kanpur and 
New Delhi continued to be the centres receiving the highest number of customer 
complaints in 2011-12, followed by Chennai and Bhopal. 
 The rate of disposal of customer complaints by Banking Ombudsmen was 94 
per cent during 2011-12, the same as that done during the previous year.  
 The largest number (25 per cent) of customer complaints were about failure to 
meet commitments/non-observance of fair practices code, followed by (21 per cent) 
card related (ATM/Debit/Credit) complaints and complaints relating to deposit 
accounts (12 per cent). While card related complaints at 21 per cent of total 
complaints received, constituted the single largest ground of complaints received, in 
comparison to the previous year, this was a decline of 3 per cent in the number of 
complaints received on this count.  Out of the total 14,492 card related complaints, 
9348 complaints pertained to ATM / Debit Cards. Broadly, the reasons for complaints 
were: unsolicited cards, unsolicited insurance policies and recovery of premium, 
charging of annual fee in spite of being offered as 'free' card, authorisation of loans 
over phone, wrong billing, settlement offers conveyed telephonically, non-settlement 
of insurance claims after the demise of the card holder, excessive charges, wrong 
debits to account, non-dispensation of money from ATM, skimming of cards, etc. 
BO Offices continued their efforts to enhance awareness and visibility of the 
Banking Ombudsman Scheme 2006, especially in rural and semi-urban areas through 
extensive awareness programmes. These included town hall events, effective use of 
audio/visual media, releasing documentaries in local languages, telecasting 
advertisements on Doordarshan, radio, participating in live phone-in TV programmes 
answering queries of viewers, advertisement campaigns in vernacular newspapers, 
publicity material, such as, FAQs on Banking Ombudsman Scheme, leaflets in 
vernacular languages.

Background  
 The Banking Ombudsman Scheme, 1995 was notified by the Reserve 
Bank on June 14, 1995 in terms of the powers conferred on the Bank by Section 35A 
of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (10 of 1949) to provide for a system of redressal 
of grievances against banks. Since then the scheme has been revised four times - in 
2002, 2006, 2007 and 2009 to make it more relevant and effective. Presently, there 
are fifteen Banking Ombudsmen with specific jurisdiction  covering the 29 States and 
seven Union Territories in India. Since January 2006, the BOS is fully funded and 
administered by the Reserve Bank of India and its serving officers in the rank of Chief 
General Managers and General Managers are posted as Banking Ombudsmen. 
  The Scheme covers a wide range of complaints concerning deficiency in 
banking service rendered by Scheduled Commercial banks, Scheduled Primary Urban 
Co-operative banks and the Regional Rural banks. The major areas of customer 
grievances covered under the scheme include credit card complaints, internet 
banking, deficiencies in providing the promised services by both bank and its sales 
agents (DSAs), levying service charges without prior notice to the customers, non-
adherence to the Fair Practices Code adopted by individual banks, non-adherence to 
Banking Codes and Standards Board of India's Code of Bank's Commitment to 
Customers, etc. As on date, there are 27 grounds on which customers can approach 
the Banking Ombudsman citing deficiency in banking services.
