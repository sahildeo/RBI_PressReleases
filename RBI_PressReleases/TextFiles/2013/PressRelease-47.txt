collection, dissemination and data management processes in the RBI and examine 
the feasibility of moving towards granular, multi-purpose data collection and more

entities, delivering quality information to data users and reinforcing the management 
information system for policy making.

data gaps and information management in the Reserve Bank. 
(iii) In the light of (i) and (ii) above, suggest changes in the process of receipt, 
storage, access, management and dissemination of monetary, macro-
financial and supervisory data. 
(iv) In order to achieve (iii) above, suggest necessary institutional and 
technological changes within the Reserve Bank to make available consistent 
data from a single source for all user groups as well as for management 
decision making. 
(v) To suggest complementary technological and process changes at the level of 
banks so that granular data are made available from the source system 
which could ensure data integrity.  
(vi) To consider any other related matter.

 Committee on Data and Information Management  
in the Reserve Bank of India 
 
 The information requirement for monetary and macro financial policies as well as 
supervision has become more demanding with the increasing integration of the Indian 
economy and markets with the global economy. Periodic assessment of the institutional 
process of data capture and management, therefore, becomes important to strengthen the 
information base of policy making. However, for an emerging market economy like India, 
timely availability of consistent data and organisation of such data remains a challenge. 
Furthermore, the recent global financial crisis has prompted international institutions like the 
IMF, BIS and G20 to identify and address data gaps. In this context, it has become 
necessaryto review our data collection, dissemination and data management processes in a 
comprehensive way. A strategic shift towards granular, multi-purpose data collection and 
more integrated and structured data production processes can effectively reduce the burden 
on reporting entities and, at the same time, deliver quality information to data users and 
reinforce the management information system. 
 
2. Against the above background, a Committee is set upwith the following terms of 
reference: 
(i) To review the availability, coverage, frequency, timeliness and quality of the existing 
data/surveys/information used for: (a) monetary policy, (b) macro- financial policy, 
and (c) supervision. 
(ii) To review the recommendations of the earlier Committees/Working Groups on data 
gaps and information management in the Reserve Bank. 
(iii) In the light of (i) and (ii) above, suggest changes to the process of receipt,storage, 
access, management and dissemination of monetary, macro-financial and 
supervisory data. 
(iv) In order to achieve (iii) above, suggest necessary institutional and technological 
changes within the Reserve Bank to make available consistent data from a single 
source for all user groups as well as for management decision making.
