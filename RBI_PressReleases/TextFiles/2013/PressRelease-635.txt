 The Reserve Bank may trigger fresh floatation of market loans when the

 The Reserve Bank would retain the flexibility to revise the limits at any time, in 
consultation with the Government of India, taking into consideration the prevailing 
circumstances.  
 The interest rate on WMA/overdraft will be:

 The minimum balance required to be maintained by the Government of India

 As per the provisions of the agreement dated March 26, 1997 between the
