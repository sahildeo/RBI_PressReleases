Performance of the Private Corporate Business Sector during  
First Quarter of 2013-14 – Data Release 
The Reserve Bank of India today released, on its website, the data on the 
performance of non-financial private corporate business sector during first quarter of 
2013-14 (April-June 2013). 
The data compiled are based on the abridged financial results of 2,768 listed non-
government non-financial (NGNF) companies. To enable comparison, similar data 
pertaining to Q4:2012-13 and Q1:2012-13 are also presented. Coverage of companies in 
different quarters varies to some extent, depending on date of declaration of quarterly 
results but it is not expected to alter the aggregate position significantly. ‘Explanatory 
Notes’ containing the brief methodology followed for compilation of data and the glossary 
of terms is given at the end. 
Highlights: 
• Sales growth (Y-o-Y) continued to decelerate and reached the post crisis low of 2.6 
per cent. Total expenditure growth also declined to 2.2 per cent mainly due to raw 
material expenses contraction.  
• Earnings before Interest, Tax, Depreciation & Amortization (EBITDA or operating 
profits) grew marginally by 1.1 per cent against near stagnation seen in the previous 
quarter. However, net profit contracted for the second consecutive quarter. While 
EBITDA margin remained range bound, net profit margin declined further. 
• Sales of the manufacturing sector remained almost stagnant with a growth of only 0.8 
per cent in Q1:FY14. EBITDA and net profits contracted and profitability in terms of 
EBITDA and net profit margins worsened.  
• Sales growth for the non-IT services sector was lower than that of the previous 
quarter.  EBITDA recorded a meagre growth of 1.3 per cent but net profit contracted. 
EBITDA and net profit margins recorded some improvement. 
• Improvement in sales growth was noticed for the IT sector. EBITDA also grew at a 
higher rate in comparison to the previous quarter. Net profit increased after 
contraction in Q4:FY13. While EBITDA margin improved, net profit margin continued 
to decline. 
• Growth in the interest expenses recorded increase in Q1:FY14 at the aggregate level 
and also for the manufacturing sector. Interest coverage ratio (Earnings before 
Interest & Tax/Interest expenses) contracted for manufacturing and services (other 
than IT) sectors.   
• Decline in sales growth was spread across most of the industries.  Sales contracted 
in the motor vehicles, iron & steel, cement, coke & refined petroleum products and 
electrical machinery and apparatus industries among the major industries. Cement, 
iron & steel and construction industries witnessed significant contraction in EBITDA 
and net profit. Profit margins contracted in all these industries. Interest coverage 
declined in most of the industries.
