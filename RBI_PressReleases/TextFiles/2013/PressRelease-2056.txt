“Financial literacy and financial inclusion are integral to each other”:  
Dr. D. Subbarao, Governor, Reserve Bank of India 
Reserve Bank of India hosts the RBI-OECD-World Bank Regional Conference 
on Financial Education at New Delhi 
“Financial literacy and financial inclusion are integral to each other and are 
important because they are integral to attacking poverty. They are two elements of 
an integral strategy; while financial inclusion provides access, financial literacy 
provides awareness”. This was stated by Dr. D. Subbarao, Governor, Reserve Bank 
of India today at the RBI-OECD-World Bank Regional Conference on Financial 
Education in New Delhi. The Conference has been organised by the Reserve Bank 
of India in collaboration with the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and 
Development (OECD) and the World Bank during March 4-6, 2013.  The three-day 
Regional Conference would present the work of the Russia/OECD/World Bank Trust 
Fund on Financial Literacy and Education and address specificities from India and 
the Asia region, notably national strategies for financial education, the measurement 
of financial literacy and methods for programme evaluation together with financial 
education for young people and women, as well as innovative delivery methods. 
Each session will include a discussion of case studies chosen among relevant and 
successful examples from Asia in particular. This conference is attended by high-
level Indian, OECD and World Bank representatives, high-level officials and experts 
from ministries of finance and education, central banks, regulatory and supervisory 
authorities, officials of State governments and international organisations, the private 
sector, the academic and civil community as well as NGOs. 
Elaborating on the role of a central bank in financial literacy, the Governor 
stated that an important part of the mandate of a central bank is to preserve financial 
stability- an essential prerequisite for financial stability is financial literacy and a 
central bank has a unique leverage in providing it. He emphasised that financial 
inclusion is good for all stake holders and explained that it is win-win for the poor, 
banks, government and economy. It was good for the poor as it gave them an 
opportunity to improve their incomes and their quality of life; it was good for the 
banks as it provided steady low cost savings and it was good for the government as 
it was a powerful tool of poverty reduction, as it also cuts down leakage; and finally it 
was good for the economy as it channelised savings of the poor into formal financial 
sector. “It is not just a public good but a merit good”, the Governor stated and noted 
that although India had many accomplishments in the area of financial inclusion, 
there were many challenges ahead. Good policies and effective implementation 
could make a big difference he said.

Earlier, Dr. K.C. Chakrabarty, Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India in his 
welcome remarks stated that the Reserve Bank of India was very proud to co-host 
this landmark conference, as it brought together all key stakeholders who were 
central to India’s crusade for achieving universal financial literacy. The Reserve Bank 
believed that the conference provided an ideal platform, not only for India, but also 
for delegates from other jurisdictions especially, the Asia Pacific Region, to 
exchange views and learn from the experiences of peers. Dr. Chakrabarty observed 
that financial illiteracy was a global problem. He hoped that the conference would 
succeed in valuable sharing of knowledge and experience among a wide array of 
experts from across the world. He hoped that with collective efforts towards universal 
financial education, individuals and institutions would be empowered to make 
informed financial choices and in the process, the global financial marketplace would 
become a more stable arena, much less vulnerable to financial crisis. That would be 
the ultimate goal of building financial capability in any society, according to him. 
Speaking on the occasion, Ambassador Richard Boucher, Deputy Secretary 
General, OECD, remarked that the goal of policy makers was to improve the well-
being of the people and empower the poor. He said that the objective of both 
financial inclusion and financial literacy was to improve access. Globally, the triad of 
Financial Inclusion, Financial Literacy and Consumer Protection had been 
recognised as intertwining threads in pursuit of Financial Stability and this had been 
endorsed by the G20 as well. He also touched upon the need for robust data for 
achieving meaningful financial inclusion. Congratulating India and the Reserve Bank, 
he said that their unique efforts would definitely improve financial inclusion. 
Mr Onno Ruhl, India Country Director, World Bank in his opening remarks 
acknowledged the role of the Reserve Bank and the OECD in furthering financial 
inclusion. He said that he believed that with elements such as unique identity 
numbers and the Government endeavouring cash transfers directly to beneficiary 
accounts, India is on the eve of a major revolution in financial inclusion space. He 
also remarked that India was the vanguard and could get far ahead in the coming 
five years.
