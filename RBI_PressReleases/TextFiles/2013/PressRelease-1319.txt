RBI releases Draft Guidelines on Wealth Management/ 
Marketing/Distribution Services offered by Banks 
The Reserve Bank of India today released on its website, ‘Draft Guidelines on 
Wealth Management/Marketing/Distribution Services offered by Banks’ for comments 
and feedback. 
Comments / feedback on the draft guidelines may be sent by email latest by 
July 31, 2013 to the Chief General Manager, Department of Banking Operations and 
th
Development, Reserve Bank of India, Central Office Building, 13 Floor, S.B. Singh 
Marg, Mumbai–400001. 
Background 
The Monetary Policy Statement for 2013-14 had indicated that banks offering 
Wealth Management Services (WMS) which include referral services, Investment 
Advisory Services (IAS) and Portfolio Management Services (PMS) are exposed to 
reputational risks on account of mis-selling of products, conflicts of interest, lack of 
knowledge and clarity about products and frauds. The Monetary Policy Statement 
had also indicated that detailed guidelines on marketing and distribution of third-party 
financial products would be issued in the wake of the irregularities observed in banks 
offering such services. It was, therefore, proposed to issue comprehensive guidelines 
on wealth management and marketing/distribution services offered by banks.
