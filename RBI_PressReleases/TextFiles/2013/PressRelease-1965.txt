WMA Limits for Government of India  
fixed for the Financial Year 2013-14  
 
It has been decided, in consultation with the Government of India, that the 
limits for Ways and Means Advances (WMA) for the first half of the financial year 
2013-14 (April 2013- Sep 2013) would be `30,000 crore. 
 
The Reserve Bank may trigger fresh floatation of market loans when the 
Government of India utilises 75 per cent of the WMA limit.  
 
The Reserve Bank would retain the flexibility to revise the limits at any time, in 
consultation with the Government of India, taking into consideration the prevailing 
circumstances.  
 
The interest rate on WMA/overdraft will be:  
a) WMA : Repo Rate  
b) Overdraft : Two percent above the Repo Rate  
 
The minimum balance required to be maintained by the Government of India 
with the Reserve Bank of India will not be less than `100 crore on Fridays, on the 
date of closure of Government of India's financial year and on June 30, i.e., closure 
of the annual accounts of the Reserve Bank of India and not less than `10 crore on 
other days.  
 
As per the provisions of the agreement dated March 26, 1997 between the 
Government of India and the Reserve Bank of India, overdrafts beyond ten 
consecutive working days will not be allowed. 
 
  The WMA limits for the second half of the financial year 2013-14 would be 
fixed in September 2013.
