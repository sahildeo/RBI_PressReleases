DRG Study No. 39 -  
Modelling Currency Demand in India: An Empirical Study 
The Reserve Bank of India released today the DRG Study titled, “Modelling 
Currency Demand in India: An Empirical Study”. The study is co-authored by Dr. D. 
M. Nachane, A. B. Chakraborty, A. K. Mitra and Sanjib Bordoloi.  
The main objective of the study was to examine evolving determinants of currency 
demand in the Indian context and develop a suitable framework for modelling 
currency demand at the aggregate level as well as for the denominational 
composition. Main features of the study are: 
? The study conducted an extensive survey of literature on various aspects of 
currency demand from the central bank’s perspective of currency 
management with the literature review focussing on international evidence due 
to paucity of studies in the Indian context. 
? It identified various factors influencing currency demand in India and analysed 
the behaviour and characteristics of currency circulation and its relationship 
with the major determinants, such as, output growth, consumption, inflation, 
interest rates and growing usage of non-cash payment instruments.  
? It examined the relationship between currency circulation and various 
explanatory variables and established existence of co-integrating relationship 
in a vector error correction model (VECM) framework for aggregate currency 
demand as well as for various currency groups. 
? Its modelling of aggregate currency at both, annual and quarterly frequencies, 
allowed examination of long-term behaviour as well as short-term dynamics. In 
view of considerable volatility of circulation of individual denominations and 
limitations relating to the availability of quarterly data, the study also identified 
suitable denomination groups of banknotes that are amenable to the 
development of similar models based on annual data. 
Some important findings of the study are:  
? At the aggregate level, currency circulation has increased at a faster pace 
than growth in nominal GDP.  
? Despite emergence of various alternatives to cash transactions, currency 
retains its pre-dominance. 
? The increase in currency, broad money and household financial saving in 
relation to GDP reflects transition of a low income underdeveloped economy  
????? ??????????????into an economy characterised by increasing monetisation and 
commercialisation.  
? During the past four decades, there has been a significant change in the 
composition of currency circulation across denominations. The average value 
of a currency note (for denominations of Rs. 10 and above) increased nearly 
eight-fold while there was a 18 fold rise in the price level. Thus, the average 
value of a note did not keep pace with inflation. 
? Trends in currency circulation at individual denomination level show 
considerable fluctuations, due to which econometric modelling became 
complex. Its analysis needs further refinement to take into account other 
factors, such as, currency substitutes for payment (credit/debit cards, internet 
banking and cheque payments). 
? Annual data indicated existence of co-integrating relationship between 
currency circulation, GDP, WPI and deposit rates. Income elasticity of 
currency was found to be somewhat higher in comparison to long-term 
elasticity observed in similar studies for advanced countries. 
? It also established co-integrating relationships between different groups of 
currency notes with per capita GDP, WPI and other explanatory variables, 
although the findings were not very robust. 
? A few limitations of the study arose from the non-availability of relevant data 
pertaining to, among other things, distribution pattern of the size of currency 
based transactions, shadow economy and regional dimensions of currency 
demand.  
? The study also makes a few suggestions for future improvements in the 
framework for currency analysis in India. These are:  
o First, efforts may be made to design a system to capture the magnitude 
of mismatches between demand and supply of currency in the 
economy.  
o Second, a system of regular surveys to elicit information on public 
behaviour and preference for various denominations of currency may 
be useful. Also, changes in the micro level determinants of currency 
requirement, especially for smaller denominations, such as, transport 
tariff structure, etc., may be considered.  
o Third, estimation of regional demand for currency could be attempted 
though the data requirements for such an exercise would be formidable.
