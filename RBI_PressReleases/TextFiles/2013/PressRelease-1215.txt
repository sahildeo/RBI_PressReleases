Performance of the Private Corporate Business Sector during  
Fourth Quarter of 2012-13 - Data Release 
The Reserve Bank of India today released, on its website, the data on the 
performance of non-financial private corporate business sector during fourth quarter of 
2012-13 (January-March 2013). 
The data compiled are based on the abridged financial results of 2,686 listed non-
government non-financial (NGNF) companies.  
To enable comparison, similar data pertaining to Q3:2012-13 and Q4:2011-12 are 
also presented.  
Coverage of companies in different quarters varies to some extent, depending on 
the date of declaration of quarterly results but it is not expected to alter the aggregate 
position significantly.  
‘Explanatory Notes’ containing the brief methodology followed for compilation of 
data and the glossary of terms are given at the end. 
Highlights: 
• Sales growth continued to decelerate for six succesive quarters and reached the 
lowest since Q2:2009-10. 
• Earnings before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) and net 
profits contracted after observing growth in the preceeding two quarters - Q2 and 
Q3 of 2012-13.  
• Growth in interest expenses slowed down as compared with the previous quarter, 
resulting in lesser interest burden and improved interest coverage ratio. 
• EBITDA and Earnings before Interest and Tax (EBIT) margins improved slightly, 
net profit margin declined nominally. 
• Slide in sales growth (Y-o-Y) is spread across manufacturing and non-IT services 
sectors. IT sector witnessed some increase in sales growth in comparison to the 
previous quarter. 
• EBITDA growth improved for the IT sector and slowed down for the manufacturing 
sector. EBITDA contracted for non-IT services sector. Net profits contracted for all 
three sectors. 
• Large companies witnessed a slower increase in sales and expenditure with 
marginal rise in EBITDA and contracting net profits. Companies with sales 
between `5 - `10 billion performed better than the previous quarters. All other 
companies witnessed contraction.
