RBI releases its monthly Bulletin for January 2013 - New Series 
The Reserve Bank of India today released the January 2013 issue of its 
monthly RBI Bulletin. As announced in the press release dated December 24, 2012, 
the January Bulletin carries an indicative calendar of release for 32 articles during the 
course of the calendar year 2013 to achieve greater transparency. The articles would 
put forth the views of the Reserve Bank’s research staff on varied issues. 
The crisp ‘Current Statistics’ section now includes additional tables on sectoral 
deployment of credit, new consumer price index, turnover in select financial markets, 
payment system indicators, external commercial borrowings and international 
investment position,  for wider dissemination of critical information on the economy. 
The January 2013 Bulletin includes one special article: Performance of 
Private Corporate Business Sector during First Half of 2012-13. Based on quarterly 
financial results of 2,832 listed non-government non-financial (NGNF) companies, 
the article provides a brief analysis of the performance at the aggregate level as well 
as by size and major industries. It captures the evolving trend in sales, expenditure 
and profit margins of the corporate sector over a longer horizon. The detailed data 
used in the analysis in the article were released separately on the Reserve Bank 
website on January 9, 2013. 
 
Highlights: 
i) Sales growth of the private (non-financial) corporate business sector declined 
further in the first half of 2012-13. While there was a modest growth in 
operating profits, net profits increased, reversing the declining trend observed 
in the  previous two half years. 
ii) The decline in sales growth was broad-based across manufacturing, IT and 
non-IT services sectors. While the net profit margin of the IT sector was 
maintained, the non-IT services registered a fall in margin. 
iii) Performance of smaller companies was relatively weaker as compared with 
that of larger companies.
