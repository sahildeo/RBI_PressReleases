In respect of IndusInd Bank Ltd. where such scrutiny has been conducted and

reply was found to be satisfactory or no violation of serious nature has been 
established; it has been decided not to impose any monetary penalty but only to 
issue suitable cautionary letter. 
Background 
It may be recalled that the Reserve Bank of India had carried out a scrutiny of 
books of accounts, internal control, compliance systems and processes of these 
banks at their offices during April and May 2013. The scrutiny of these banks 
revealed violation of certain regulations and instructions issued by Reserve Bank of 
India, namely, 
• non-adherence to certain aspects of know your customer (KYC) norms and 
anti money laundering (AML) guidelines like customer identification procedure, 
risk categorisation, periodical review of risk profiling of account holders, 
periodical KYC updation

• non-adherence of KYC norms for walk in customers including for sale of third 
party products, omission in filing of cash transaction reports (CTRs) in respect 
of some cash transactions 
• non-adherence to instructions on monitoring of transactions in customer 
accounts including walk-in-customers 
• non-adherence to instructions which prohibit acceptance of cash above  ` 50, 
000 from customers for sale of gold coins and issue of Demand Drafts etc. 
• non-adherence to instructions on import of gold on consignment basis 
• non-adherence to instructions on permitted credits to Non-resident accounts 
The investigation did not reveal any prima facie evidence of money laundering. 
However, any conclusive inference in this regard can be drawn only by an end to end 
investigation of the transactions by tax and enforcement agencies.  
Based on the findings of the scrutiny, the Reserve Bank issued a show cause 
notice to each of these banks, in response to which the individual banks submitted 
written replies. After considering the facts of each case and individual bank’s reply, 
as also, personal submissions, information submitted and documents furnished, the 
Reserve Bank came to the conclusion that some of the violations were substantiated 
and warranted imposition of monetary penalty. The Reserve Bank penalised the first 
of three banks on June 10, 2013 and second lot of 22 banks on July.
