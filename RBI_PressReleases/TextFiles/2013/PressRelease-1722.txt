Quarterly Industrial Outlook Survey: April-June 2013 (Round 62) 
nd
 The Reserve Bank of India has launched the 62 round of the Industrial 
Outlook Survey (IOS) for reference period April-June 2013. The Reserve Bank has 
been conducting the Industrial Outlook Survey on a quarterly basis since 1998. The 
survey gives an insight into the perception of the public and private limited companies 
engaged in manufacturing activities about their own performance and prospects. The 
survey covers non-financial private and public limited companies with a good 
size/industry representation. The assessment of business sentiments for the current 
quarter and expectations for the ensuing quarter are based on qualitative responses 
to 22 major parameters covering overall business situation, financial situation, 
demand indicators, price and employment, profit margins, etc. The survey provides 
useful forward looking inputs for policymakers, analysts and businesses alike. 
 The salient features of this survey results at the aggregate level are published 
in Macroeconomic and Monetary Developments with data release in every quarter.    
A detailed article based on the results for the quarters April-June 2012-13 to January-
March 2012-13 will be published in July 2013 issue of the RBI monthly Bulletin. 
 M/s Centre for Research Planning and Action, New Delhi has been mandated 
to conduct the survey for this quarter on behalf of the Reserve Bank of India. 
Manufacturing companies will be approached by this agency during the quarter.
