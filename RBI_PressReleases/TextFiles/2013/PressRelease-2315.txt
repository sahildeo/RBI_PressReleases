RBI Working Paper Series 1 / 2013 
Financial stability enables banking sector to  
absorb shocks, economy to bounce back 
The Reserve Bank today placed on its website a Working Paper titled “Banking 
Stability - A Precursor to Financial Stability” under the RBI Working Paper Series. The 
paper has been written by Dr. Rabi N. Mishra, Shri S. Majumdar and Ms. Dimple Bhandia. 
The issue of financial stability is closely linked with banking stability, especially in 
bank dominant financial systems like India. The historical evidences demonstrate that 
those financial crises which had stronger involvement of the banking sector had a more 
devastating effect on the real sector. The financial crisis of 2007-08 was no exception. 
Banking stability itself can be treated as a combined effect of several parameters, e.g., 
asset quality, liquidity, capital, costs and profitability, etc. The degree of stability varies 
during the period with changes occurring in one or more of its constituents. Though the 
stability of the banking sector gets affected positively or negatively with the conditions 
prevailing in the financial market and the real economy; ultimately it determines as to what 
extent financial stability is ensured in the economy by its ability to absorb the shocks. 
Stability of the banking sector may, therefore, be treated as a forerunner of financial 
stability in an economy. 
This paper has made an attempt to develop a methodology for a banking stability 
indicator for India by way of combining some of those indicators which are important in 
gauging the health of the banking sector. The paper also analyses the linkage of banking 
stability indicator with the financial markets and the real sector.  
Major findings: 
• Banking stability indicator, constructed with five dimensions, provides insight into 
the performance of the banking sector and thus could be in a way considered a 
leading indicator. 
• The paper establishes a link between banking stability and financial stability. 
Continued financial stability improves banking stability and enables the banking 
sector to absorb shocks during times of crises, thus minimising the impact and 
helping the economy to bounce back with minimum time lag. 
• During the period under review, banking stress explains around 33 per cent 
variability of stress in financial markets, whereas, financial markets explain only 17 
per cent of variability in banking stress.   
• The impact of GDP growth on asset quality of the banking sector, assessed using 
Granger’s causality test, shows that GDP growth impacts the asset quality 
significantly. 
• The movements in banking stability indicator indicate that there are symptoms of a 
moderate rise in instability of the banking sector in recent periods mainly on 
account of deterioration in asset quality.
