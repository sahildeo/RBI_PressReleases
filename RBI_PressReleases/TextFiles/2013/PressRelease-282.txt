RBI releases “Statistical Tables Relating to Banks in India 2012-13”  
 
The Reserve Bank of India today released the Statistical Tables Relating to Banks in 
India 2012-13 – an annual publication that provides key information on banks.  
 
The publication provides bank-wise and bank group-wise information on major items 
such as liabilities and assets, income and expenses, non-performing assets, financial ratios, 
spatial distribution of offices, number of employees and details of priority sector advances. It 
also provides bank group-wise monthly data on some of the major items that include 
aggregate deposits, liabilities to the banking system, assets with the banking system, 
investments, bank credit, and sector-wise and industry-wise gross bank credit.  
  
The analysis based on the data presented in the publication shows that:   
 
• Credit-Deposit ratio of all scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) at the aggregate 
level increased in 2012-13.  
 
• Ratio of demand and savings bank deposits to total deposits of all SCBs at the 
aggregate level declined marginally in 2012-13. 
 
• Net interest margin (NIM) for all SCBs declined marginally during 2012-13. At the 
bank group level, NIM of “New Private Sector Banks” increased, remained 
unchanged for “Foreign Banks” and declined for rest of the bank-groups in 2012-
13. 
 
• Profitability in terms of return on assets (RoA) of all SCBs at the aggregate level 
declined marginally during 2012-13. At the bank group level, RoA declined in 
respect of “Public Sector Banks” while all other bank groups witnessed an 
increase in RoA during 2012-13. 
 
• Cost of funds increased for all the bank-groups in 2012-13. At the same time, 
return on advances declined for all bank-groups except “Private Sector Banks”.  
 
• Return on investments adjusted to cost of funds declined in 2012-13 in all the 
bank-groups.
