Reserve Bank Cancels the Licence of  
Gujarat Industrial Co-operative Bank Ltd., Ahmedabad (Gujarat) 
In view of the fact that Gujarat Industrial Co-operative Bank Ltd, Ahmedabad 
(Gujarat) had ceased to be solvent, all efforts to revive it in close consultation with 
the Government of Gujarat had failed and the depositors were being inconvenienced 
by continued uncertainty, the Reserve Bank of India delivered the order cancelling 
its licence to the bank before commencement of business on November 11, 2011. 
The Central Registrar of Co-operative Societies, New Delhi has also been requested 
to issue an order for winding up the bank and appoint a liquidator for the bank.  It 
may be highlighted that on liquidation, every depositor is entitled to repayment of 
his/her deposits up to a monetary ceiling of `1,00,000/- (Rupees One lakh only) from 
the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) under usual 
terms and conditions.  
2. The bank was granted a licence by Reserve Bank of India on September 29, 
1999 to commence banking business. The statutory inspection conducted by 
Reserve Bank of India conducted under Section 35 of the Banking Regulation Act, 
1949 (AACS) with reference to its financial position as on March 31, 2007 revealed 
that the assessed networth was (-) ` 6930.61 lakh, CRAR was (-) 24.0% and gross 
and net NPAs were 40.8% and 30.4% of the gross and net advances respectively 
and the deposits of the bank was eroded to the extent of 14.8%.  
3.(a)  In view of its precarious financial position and with a view to preventing 
preferential payments and protecting the interest of the depositors, the bank was 
placed under Directions under Section 35A of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 
(AACS) with effect from the close of business on September 20, 2008 restricting 
withdrawal of deposits to `1000/- per depositor.  
(b)  The Board of Directors of the bank was superseded under section 36 AAA of 
Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (AACS) and an Administrator was appointed from the 
same date due to certain serious irregularities such as raising fictitious entries under 
branch adjustment/interest receivable heads, huge shortfall in provisioning due to 
wrong asset classification and under-reporting of NPAs, accounting fraud committed 
in non-banking assets, malfunctioning of the Board of Directors and its deliberate 
attempt to project better financial position of the bank with the help of manipulated 
balance sheet. 
(c)  A criminal complaint has been filed by the Administrator of the bank against 
the ex-Board of Directors for their acts of omissions and commissions leading to 
huge losses to the bank. 
4.   The financial parameters of the bank continued to deteriorate during the 
subsequent inspections conducted with reference to its financial position as on 
March 31, 2008 and March 31, 2009.

5.  The revival plan submitted by the Administrator of the bank in July 2009 was 
not found viable as it was not in conformity with the extant guidelines issued by RBI. 
A Show Cause Notice for cancellation of licence under Section 22 of the Banking 
Regulation Act, 1949 (AACS) was issued on August 20, 2009. The reply submitted 
by the bank was examined but was not considered satisfactory and the decision on 
the future set up of the bank was kept in abeyance as efforts were being taken for 
merging the bank with a strong UCB.  
6.  The statutory inspection of the bank carried out under Section 35 of the Act 
ibid with reference to its financial position as on March 31, 2010 revealed further 
deterioration in its financial position and other violations. Its net worth and CRAR 
were assessed at (-)` 29184.18 lakh and (-) 365.0% respectively. The erosion in 
deposits was to the extent of 60.4%. The gross and net NPAs formed 85.4% and 
21.3% of the gross and net advances respectively. The assessed net loss of the 
bank stood at ` 3963.93 lakh as against the reported net loss of ` 3872.93 lakh. 
7.(a)  The revised revival plan submitted by the bank in March/April 2010 was 
considered but found not viable as it was not in conformity with RBI guidelines. 
(b)  The merger proposal from Saraswat Bank Ltd., Mumbai did not materialise. 
The commercial banks which conducted the due diligence for taking over the assets 
and liabilities of the UCB expressed their unwillingness for the same. 
8.  Serious deficiencies as mentioned above revealed that the affairs of the bank 
were being conducted in a manner detrimental to the interests of the depositors. The 
bank did not comply with the provisions of Sections 11(1) and 22(3)(a) & (b) of the 
Act ibid. In view of the aforesaid serious deficiencies/irregularities and the 
deteriorating financial position of the bank, the Reserve Bank of India issued a Show 
Cause Notice  (SCN) to the bank on April 21, 2011 to show cause as to why the 
licence granted to it on September 29, 1999 to conduct banking business should not 
be cancelled. The bank submitted its reply to the SCN vide its letter dated May 23, 
2011, which was examined but not found satisfactory. Further, no concrete proposal 
for merger or any viable revival/restructuring plan was received from the bank. 
9.  Therefore, Reserve Bank of India took the extreme measure of cancelling the 
licence of the bank in the interest of bank's depositors. With the cancellation of 
licence and commencement of liquidation proceedings, the process of paying the 
depositors of the Gujarat Industrial Co-operative Bank Ltd, Ahmedabad (Gujarat), 
the amount insured as per the DICGC Act, 1961 will be set in motion subject to the 
terms and conditions of the Deposit Insurance Scheme. 
10. Consequent to the cancellation of its licence, the Gujarat Industrial Co-
operative Bank Ltd, Ahmedabad (Gujarat) is prohibited from carrying on business of 
‘banking’ as defined in Section 5(b) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (AACS).
