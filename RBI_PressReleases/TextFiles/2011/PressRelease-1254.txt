RBI releases Guidelines on Introduction of CDS for Corporate Bonds 
 
The Reserve Bank of India has, today, issued, the ‘Guidelines on Introduction 
of Credit Default Swaps (CDS) for Corporate Bonds’. As creation of market 
infrastructure, such as, trade repository is essential for CDS, it has been decided that 
the guidelines would become effective from October 24, 2011. 
 
 It may be recalled that in terms of the announcement made in the Second 
Quarter Review of Monetary Policy of 2009-10, an internal Working Group was 
constituted to finalise the operational framework for the introduction of plain vanilla 
over-the-counter (OTC) single-name CDS for corporate bonds in India. The Group 
submitted its final report in February, 2011. Based on the recommendations of the 
report, the draft guidelines on CDS were prepared and placed on the Reserve 
Bank’s website on February 23, 2011 for public comments. Taking into account the 
feedback received from the market participants and other stake holders, the 
guidelines on CDS have been finalised.
