RBI changes Date for Operationalisation of  
CDS Guidelines for Corporate Bonds 
 
  The Reserve Bank of India has decided to postpone operationalisation of 
the Credit Default Swaps (CDS) guidelines for corporate bonds. The new date 
will be announced shortly.  
It may be recalled that the Reserve Bank had indicated in its Press 
Release No. 2010-2011/1707 dated May 24, 2011 that the guidelines on CDS 
would be effective from October 24, 2011. In this regard, necessary infrastructure 
which includes trade repository, documentation, publication of CDS curve for 
valuation, standardisation of contracts, etc., required for the launch of the 
product is being put in place. Further, market participants have asked for certain 
clarifications regarding documentation, operational aspects and the arrangement 
for necessary institutional framework. Hence it has been decided to postpone the 
date of operationalisation of the CDS guidelines issued in May 2011.
