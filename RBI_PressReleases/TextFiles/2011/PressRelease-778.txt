Half-yearly Report on Management of  
Foreign Exchange Reserves (March 2011) 
The Reserve Bank of India today released the 16th half-yearly report on 
management of foreign exchange reserves with reference to March 2011. 
It may be recalled that in February 2004, the Reserve Bank commenced a 
process of compiling half yearly reports and placing them in public domain for 
bringing about more transparency and also for enhancing the level of disclosure. 
The reports are published with a lag of about three months. The first such report 
for the half year ended September 30, 2003 was released on February 3, 2004.
