Statistics Day Conference - July 5, 2011 
th
The Reserve Bank of India organised the 5 Statistics Day Conference on 
July 5, 2011. Statistics Day marks the birth anniversary of Prof. P.C. Mahalanobis, 
the legendary statistician who contributed enormously on the development 
of statistics and statistical infrastructure in the country. On this occasion, 
distinguished statisticians viz., Prof. Sastry G. Pantula and Prof. Rajeeva        
L. Karandikar spoke on topics relevant to statistical analysis in central banks such 
as time series and financial statistics. 
Recounting the value of immense contributions of Prof. P. C. Mahalanobis in 
Statistics, Dr. D. Subbarao, Governor, Reserve Bank of India in his inaugural 
address highlighted the relevance and importance of statistics and statistical 
analysis to support policy formulation. He emphasised that policy calibration, be it 
monetary policy, regulatory actions or decisions in pursuit of financial stability, is 
improved by the quality of data at our command and our ability to analyse and 
interpret that data.  Citing an example of the new series of index of industrial 
production (IIP), Governor indicated that while the new series is consistent with the 
other related indicators, the old series was contrary to the underlying trend of the 
deceleration after the global financial crisis.  The new series also shows that there 
has not been an industrial slowdown in the second half of 2010-11, contrary to the 
indication of the old series. Referring to the interpretation of inflation data, 
Governor indicated that WPI has been opted as a second best choice in absence 
of a single CPI representing the whole country. Further referring to RBI’s 
preference for non-food manufactured product inflation as an indicator of demand 
side pressure, Governor indicated that core inflation is a derived measure from the 
headline inflation which is designed to capture the persistence component of 
inflation and amenable to policy. While it is true that commodity prices influence 
the non-food manufactured products component of WPI, it is also true that the 
pass-through from higher commodity prices to WPI depends critically upon the 
underlying demand conditions in the economy.  In this context, Governor 
welcomed the compilation of new CPI (rural and urban).  However, there is a need 
for a longer time-series data for making them suitable for policy purposes. 
Drawing upon the basic principle that drove Prof. Mahalanobis in his use of 
data and statistical analysis, Dr. Subir Gokarn, Deputy Governor emphasised the 
need for understanding of the various actors at play and various inter-relationships 
between them for effective decision-making.  In the context of policy challenges 
and analytical complexities faced by the Reserve Bank, he highlighted the need for 
understanding the structural breaks for better assessment of the ever evolving 
economy.  He also highlighted the merits of triangulation i.e. approaching a 
problem from three different dimensions that allows one to draw a boundary 
??????????2 
 
around the set of reasonably accurate assessments of the situation, which then 
make the leap to the policy decision manageable.  The first of these is the data 
from household surveys that are conducted regularly providing inputs to the 
forward looking decision-making process.  The second side relates to the 
understanding of the business cycle indicators from the company surveys. The 
third side of the triangle is an extensive consultation process, with banks and other 
financial institutions, manufacturing and service companies, various industry 
associations and professional economists. Thus, effective triangulation represents 
an efficient alignment of three different dimensions of data and decision-making. 
While welcoming the participants, Shri Deepak Mohanty, Executive Director 
briefly discussed the role and responsibilities of the statisticians in Reserve Bank 
of India. He stressed the need for timely and accurate data, dissemination of data 
on real time basis, maintaining global standards, need for a quarterly policy model 
using DSGE framework, assessment of asset prices, data on employment and 
surveys for the assessment of the Reserve Bank’s financial inclusion initiatives. 
Prof. Pantula, in his keynote address, emphasised the value of time-series 
modeling for central banks.  However, he cautioned at the lack of understanding 
the true data generating process and application of alternative testing models 
consistent with the underlying economic dynamics.  Prof. Karandikar emphasised 
the limitations of using Gaussian model for the bulk of the financial risk solutions. 
While the tail of the distribution could be suitably captured by alternative modeling 
techniques, forecasting of black swan event like the recent financial meltdown is 
not practically possible.   
Based on the theme, the conference had technical sessions on time series 
analysis and financial statistics where internal research papers highlighting various 
aspects like growth inflation nexus, financial conditions index, credit risk modeling, 
and portfolio selection were presented.
