RBI Working Paper Series for August 2011 
 
The Reserve Bank of India today placed two working papers on its website. 
 
 i) Effects of Recent Financial Crisis on Optimal Asset Allocation of Foreign 
Exchange Reserves by A. K. Srimany, Sneharthi Gayen and Ranjeev 
 
Post financial crisis, yield in the developed sovereign markets is prevailing at 
very low level and consequently return generated by deployment of foreign 
exchange reserves have been very low together with increased risk of getting 
negative return more frequently. In this working papers the authors, discuss some 
strategies for the central banks to create optimum portfolio depending on their level 
of reserves under the present low yield scenario. The optimal asset allocation during 
post-crisis period suggests a concentrated portfolio as against the barbell structure 
for pre-crisis period. The authors observe that central banks can get higher pick in 
return in the post-crisis scenario than in the pre-crisis scenario for the same amount 
of increase in duration. However, in the post-crisis period the probability of negative 
return will increase substantially. The authors have also tried to find out an 
alternative strategy to increase the portfolio yield and reduce the probability of 
negative return under this low yield scenario. The authors conclude that central 
banks with medium/ long target duration can get substantial yield and return pick-up 
and also reduce the probability of negative return by including emerging Asia within 
the investment universe even without extending the duration. 
 
ii) Monetary Policy and Food Prices in India by Jeevan Kumar Khundrakpam and 
Dipika Das 
 
Using a vector error correction model (VECM), the paper examines the 
relative response of food and manufactured prices to change in interest rate and 
money supply in India during the period 2001:Q1 to 2010:Q2. It finds that, in the 
long-run, while money supply leads to rise in the prices of both, food and 
manufactured prices, hike in call rate has a negative effect only on manufactured 
prices. The impact of money supply is, however, more on food prices than on 
manufactured prices. There is no evidence of long-run neutrality of money, as 
increase in money supply leads to less than proportionate change in price. In the 
short-run, there is overshooting in the prices of both food and manufactured products 
from their respective long-run equilibrium following monetary shocks. The 
overshooting, however, is more in food prices than in manufactured prices. Further,

in the short-run, call rate has a significant impact only on manufactured prices, while 
the impact of money supply is significant only on food prices. Both food and 
manufactured prices increase induces call rate hike. But money supply increases 
with rise in food prices and decreases with the rise in manufactured prices.  
 
The Reserve Bank of India introduced in April this year, a ‘RBI Working Paper 
Series’ (RBI - WP) to provide a platform to the Reserve Bank Staff for presenting 
their research studies as well as to receive feedback from informed researchers.   
 
The views expressed in all the research publications of the Reserve Bank, 
including the RBI Working Papers Series, do not necessarily reflect the views of the 
Reserve Bank and as such should not be reported as representing the views of the 
Reserve Bank of India.  
 
Feedback, if any, on the papers could be addressed to the respective authors 
of the research studies.
