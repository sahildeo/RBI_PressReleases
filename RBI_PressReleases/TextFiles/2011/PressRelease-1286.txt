 Coins of denomination of 25 paise and below will cease to be legal tender

depots or at the offices of the Reserve Bank. The exchange facility at these bank 
branches or the Reserve Bank offices will be available till the close of business on 
June 29, 2011. The Reserve Bank of India has instructed the banks maintaining 
small coin (list annexed) to arrange for exchange of coins of denomination of         
25 paise and below for their face value at their branches.  
 
 It may be recalled that in exercise of powers conferred by Section 15A of the 
Coinage Act, 1906 (3 of 1906), the Government of India has decided to withdraw 
the coins of denomination of 25 paise and below from circulation with effect from 
June 30, 2011. From this date, these coins shall cease to be legal tender for 
payment as well as on account.
