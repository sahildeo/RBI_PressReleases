Backdrop 
The sub-committee of the Central Board of Directors of the Reserve Bank to 
study issues and concerns in the MFI sector (Malegam Committee) recommended that 
the existing guidelines on bank lending to the priority sector be revisited. Requests 
were also received from various quarters in the recent past to relook at the definition of 
the priority sector, especially where bank finance was being routed through other 
agencies. In this backdrop, it has been proposed in Paragraph 94 of the Monetary 
Policy Statement 2011-12 “to appoint a committee to re-examine the existing 
classification and suggest revised guidelines with regard to priority sector lending 
classification."
