RBI releases Discussion Paper on  
Deregulation of Savings Bank Deposit Rate 
 
As indicated in the Second Quarter Review of Monetary Policy 2010-11 on 
November 2, 2010, the Reserve Bank of India has today released on its website a 
Discussion Paper on ‘Deregulation of Savings Bank Deposit Interest Rate’. In the 
light of pros and cons of deregulation of savings deposit interest rate as set out in the 
Discussion Paper, the Reserve Bank has sought feedback from the general public 
on the following issues: 
1. Should savings deposit interest rate be deregulated at this point of time? 
 
2. Should savings deposit interest rate be deregulated completely or in a phased 
manner, subject to a minimum floor for some time? 
3. How can the concerns with regard to savers (senior citizens, pensioners, small 
savers, particularly in rural and semi-urban areas) be addressed in case 
savings deposit interest rate is deregulated?  
4. How serious are concerns relating to a possible intense competition amongst 
banks and asset-liability mismatches if savings deposit interest rate is 
deregulated? 
 
5. Should higher interest rate be paid on savings deposits without a cheque book 
facility? 
Suggestions and comments may please be sent by May 20, 2011 to the 
Adviser-in-Charge, Reserve Bank of India, Monetary Policy Department, Central 
Office, 24th floor, Central Office Building, Mumbai-400001 or by email.
