States Important Stakeholders in Inflation Management:  
RBI Governor addresses Finance Secretaries 
States are important stakeholders in inflation management as their 
contribution is important in addressing the supply side constraints. They could, for 
instance, help better management of public distribution system, improve productivity 
in agriculture and allied activities, reform the Agriculture Produce Marketing 
Committee (APMC) Acts and improve the infrastructure, such as, storage facilities, 
Dr. D. Subbarao, Governor, Reserve Bank of India, told the State Finance 
Secretaries today while inaugurating a conference held in Mumbai.  
th
The 24 Conference of the State Finance Secretaries was held in the 
Reserve Bank of India at Mumbai today. Finance Secretaries of 18 States 
participated. Dr. D.Subbarao, Governor, Reserve Bank of India inaugurated the 
Conference.  Smt. Sudha Pillai, Member Secretary, Planning Commission; Shri R. 
Gopalan, Secretary (Economic Affairs); Shri Sumit Bose, Secretary (Disinvestment) 
and Officer on Special Duty (Expenditure); Dr. Kaushik Basu, Chief Economic 
Adviser; Shri C.R.Sundaramurti, Controller General of Accounts (CGA); and Smt. 
Shyamala Gopinath, Dr. Subir Gokarn and Shri Anand Sinha, Deputy Governors and 
other senior officials of the Ministry of Finance, Comptroller and Auditor General of 
India (CAG) and the Reserve Bank attended the Conference.  
The Governor in his inaugural remarks referred to the market borrowings of 
the States and emphasised that there was a need to improve efficiency in terms of 
better planning, robust cash management and adherence to the Fiscal Responsibility 
Legislation (FRL). Besides improving revenue collections through tax reforms, the 
States should also focus on expenditure management, he said.  
He referred to implementation of Malegam Committee Report in the context of 
regulating micro finance institutions (MFIs) and said that going forward, the 
unincorporated MFIs would be regulated by the proposed central legislation 
uniformly across the states and the incorporated MFIs by the Reserve Bank. This 
was necessary to avoid regulatory arbitrage, he added.  The Governor also 
emphasised the need to improve the effectiveness of the State Level Bankers 
Committee (SLBC) and stated that one of the important items on its agenda should 
be financial inclusion and financial literacy. Here, the attempt should be to move from 
a target driven approach to more meaningful financial inclusion. He urged the State 
Governments to play a proactive role in the field of financial literacy and financial 
inclusion in collaboration with the Reserve Bank, Central Government and the banks. 
He also underlined that the State Governments should caution the public against 
entities that raise funds from gullible public through dubious schemes.
