RBI releases Study on State Finances 2010-11 
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) today released ìState Finances: A Study of 
Budgets of 2010-11î, a publication that provides data, analysis and assessment of 
finances of State governments. 
    The State governments presented their budgets for 2010-11 against the 
backdrop of an economic recovery and improving growth prospects for the Indian 
economy. Reflecting these positive developments, States had budgetted higher 
growth in own tax revenues in 2010-11 than in 2009-10 (RE). In addition, States also 
expected a larger devolution from the Centre in the form of share in Central taxes 
during 2010-11. The States had undertaken a massive expansion in aggregate 
expenditures in the previous two years in the wake of the overall macroeconomic 
slowdown and implementation of the Sixth Central/State(s) Pay Commission 
recommendations. They, therefore, budgetted a modest rise in their aggregate 
expenditures during 2010-11. All these factors indicated a move towards the 
resumption of the fiscal consolidation process at the level of States in 2010-11 after 
a slippage in the previous two years. 
Role of Finance Commissions 
The theme Chapter on ìFinance Commissions in India: An Assessmentî 
in the Study examines the role of Finance Commissions (FCs). The Chapter notes 
that apart from the constitutional tasks of deciding the proportion of tax revenue to be 
shared with the States and the principles governing the grants-in-aid of the revenues 
of the States, the scope of the Finance Commissions has broadened over time as 
they were assigned several other issues on government finances, particularly those 
relating to augmentation of State Consolidation Funds to supplementing the 
resources of local bodies and debt-related issues. An assessment of the equalisation 
component of transfers as recommended by four successive FCs (from the Tenth to 
the Thirteenth) shows that it was the highest in the case of Eleventh FC as the gap 
between recommended and benchmark transfers was minimum. 
Issues in State finances 
The Study also highlights factors which are likely to have significant 
implications for fiscal consolidation at the Statesí level while recording immediate 
and medium-term issues on State finances. While the overall macroeconomic 
environment and pace of economic recovery would remain important for State 
finances, other factors including implementation of goods and services tax (GST), 
Statesí own efforts towards mobilising non-tax revenues and 
prioritisation/rationalisation of expenditure would have implications on fiscal 
consolidation at the State level. To make credible progress towards fiscal 
consolidation, States need to amend their FRBM Acts and workout a fiscal reform 
path. States also need to review their tariff policies especially those relating to the 
power and irrigation sectors. Better allocation of expenditure along with improved 
transparency and accountability through stricter audit procedures would also be 2 
 
desirable to ensure improvement in resource use and fiscal management. States 
need to put in place an effective forecasting and monitoring mechanism for their 
cash inflows and outflows so that a need-based approach to market borrowings is 
adopted. The strengthening of State Finance Commissions is essential to ensure 
allocation of adequate resources to local bodies, keeping in view their developmental 
role for the purpose of inclusive growth. 
Major findings of the Study 
Statesí commitment towards fiscal consolidation evident in 2010-11 
ï  The budgetary position of States in 2010-11 indicated a turnaround from the 
expansionary fiscal stance in 2008-09 and 2009-10 to a fiscal consolidation 
path in 2010-11. An improvement in State finances is evident with a majority 
of the States budgeting either a revenue surplus or a lower revenue deficit in 
2010-11 (BE) as compared with 2009-10 (RE). At a consolidated level, the 
revenue deficit is placed lower at 0.3 per cent of GDP during 2010-11 (BE) as 
against 0.7 per cent in 2009-10 (RE) reflecting compression in revenue 
expenditure. 
 
ï With an improvement in the consolidated revenue account of States, the 
gross fiscal deficit as a ratio to GDP (GFD-GDP) is estimated to decline to 2.5 
per cent in 2010-11 (BE) from 3.3 per cent in 2009-10 (RE).  
Improvement in key fiscal indicators to be broad-based across States 
ï An improvement in State finances in 2010-11, based on the budgetted data, is 
broad-based and is reflected in lower GFD-GSDP ratios in the case of 22 
States. Of the 17 non-special category States, 11 States have budgetted 
lower GFD-GSDP ratios in 2010-11. All special category States have 
budgetted lower GFD-GSDP ratio during the same period. 
 
ï A majority of the States expect higher tax buoyancy (including own tax and 
tax devolution from the Centre), while non-tax revenues (own non-tax 
revenues and grants from the Centre) are budgetted to decline in 18 States.  
 
ï The revenue expenditure as ratio to GSDP is budgetted to decline in 19 
States, which is likely to be a major source for correction in their revenue 
accounts.     
Decline in key expenditure ratios raises concern regarding the quality of fiscal 
adjustment  
ï The emerging pattern of expenditure shows that as a ratio to GSDP, 
development expenditure, capital outlay and social sector expenditure are 
budgetted to be lower in many States, raising concerns about the quality of 
fiscal adjustment being undertaken at the State level. 
Decline in Statesí overall debt-GDP ratio to continue in 2010-11 
ï Despite the extra expenditure obligations emanating from the implementation 
of revised pay structures and fiscal stimulus measures, the impact in terms of 
debt-GSDP ratios remained muted in most States during 2008-09 and 2009-
10 (RE). Importantly, aggregate debt-GDP ratio at 25.0 per cent in 2009-10 
(RE) was well below the level of 30.8 per cent recommended by the Twelfth 
Finance Commission (FC). In 2010-11 (BE), the aggregate outstanding debt-
GDP ratio of States is likely to decline further to 23.1 per cent, reflecting 
higher growth in GSDP than that in outstanding debt. 
 3 
 
ï The declining trend in debt-GDP ratio would have favourable implications for 
interest payments (IP) relative to revenue receipts (RR). State-wise data show 
that 11 States were able to align their IP-RR ratios with the Twelfth FCís 
target of 15 per cent by 2009-10. The overall IP-RR ratio is budgetted to 
decline to 14.1 per cent in 2010-11 from 14.4 per cent in 2009-10 (RE), 
though it remains very high in some States.
