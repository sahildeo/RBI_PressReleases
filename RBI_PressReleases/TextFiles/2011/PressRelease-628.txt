Mid-Quarter Monetary Policy Review: September 2011 
 
Monetary Measures 
 
 On the basis of the current macroeconomic assessment, it has been decided 
           to: 
 •  increase the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility 
(LAF) by 25 basis points from 8.0 per cent to 8.25 per cent with immediate 
effect. 
 
 Consequent to the above increase in the repo rate, the reverse repo rate 
under the LAF will stand automatically adjusted to 7.25 per cent and the marginal 
standing facility (MSF) rate to 9.25 per cent with immediate effect.  
 
Introduction 
 
 Since the Reserve Bank’s First Quarter Review of July 26, the global 
macroeconomic outlook has worsened. There is growing consensus that 
sluggishness will persist longer than earlier expected. Concerns over the sovereign 
debt problem in the euro area have added further uncertainty to the prospects of 
recovery.  
 Domestically, even as many indicators point to moderating growth, both

levels. Crude oil prices remain high. Food price inflation persists notwithstanding 
a normal monsoon.  
 Inflationary pressures are expected to ease towards the later part of 2011-12. 
Stabilisation of energy prices and moderating domestic demand should facilitate this 
process.  However, in the current scenario, with the likelihood of inflation remaining high 
for the next few months, rising inflationary expectations remain a key risk. This makes it 
imperative to persevere with the current anti-inflationary stance.   
 
Global Economy 
The global economy slowed in Q2 (April-June) of 2011.  Lead indicators such 
as purchasing managers’ indices (PMIs) suggest a further moderation in economic 
activity in Q3, with the global manufacturing PMI approaching the neutral level of 50. In 
recent weeks, global financial markets have been rattled by perceptions of  inadequate 
solutions to the euro area sovereign debt problem, exposure of banks to euro area 
sovereign debt and renewed fears of recession. Global recovery will also be affected 
by fiscal consolidation measures in some of the advanced economies. 
In the US, apart from fiscal concerns, stubbornly high unemployment and weak 
housing markets continued to weigh on consumer confidence and private 
consumption. In response to the weakening of economic activity, the US Federal Open 
th
Market Committee, in its 9 August meeting, indicated that it would keep the federal 
funds rate near zero at least through mid-2013. 
Economic activity in the euro area decelerated significantly during Q2 of 2011 
reflecting decline in both private and government consumption expenditures as well as 
deceleration in capital formation. Economic activity contracted in Japan reflecting the 
impact of the earthquake/tsunami.  
In contrast to advanced economies, growth remained relatively resilient in 
emerging and developing economies, notwithstanding some moderation in response 
to monetary tightening to contain inflation.  
 
 
2Domestic Economy  
 
Growth 
 GDP growth decelerated to 7.7 per cent in Q1 of 2011-12 from 7.8 per cent in the 
previous quarter and 8.8 per cent in the corresponding quarter a year ago. 
Agricultural growth has accelerated, but industry and services have decelerated. The 
index of industrial production (IIP) slowed from 8.8 per cent year-on-year in June  to 
3.3 per cent in July. However, excluding capital goods, the growth of IIP was higher at 6.7 
per cent in July  as  compared with 4.4 per cent in June. Cumulatively, the IIP increased by 
5.8 per cent during April-July 2011, compared with an increase of 9.7 per cent in the 
corresponding period of the previous year.   
 T he HSBC Purchasing Managers' Index for the manufacturing sector also 
suggested moderation.  Corporate margins in Q1 of 2011-12 moderated across several 
sectors compared to their levels in Q4 of 2010-11. However, barring a few sectors, 
significant pass-through of rising input costs is still visible.  
 Monsoon rains so far have been normal. The first advance estimates for the 
2011-12 kharif season point to a record production of rice, oilseeds and cotton, while 
the output of pulses may decline.   
 
Inflation 
 Headline year-on-year wholesale price index (WPI) inflation rose from 9.2 per 
cent in July to 9.8 per cent in August 2011.  Inflation in respect of primary articles and 
fuel groups edged up in August. Year-on-year non-food manufactured products inflation 
rose from  7.5 per cent in July  to 7.7 per cent in August 2011 suggesting as yet 
persistent demand pressures. The oil marketing companies raised the price of petrol by 
` 3.14 per litre with effect from September 16, 2011. This will have a direct impact of  7 
basis points to WPI inflation, in addition to indirect impact with a lag. The new combined 
(rural and urban) consumer price index (base: 2010=100) rose to 110.4 in July from 
108.8 in June. Other consumer price indices registered inflation rates in the range 
of 8.4 to 9.0 per cent in July.  
 
3 
Monetary, Credit and Liquidity Conditions 
 
   Year-on-year money supply (M ) growth at 16.7 per cent in August was higher 
3
than the projection of 15.5 per cent for the year reflecting higher growth in term deposits 
and moderation in currency growth.  Similarly, year-on-year non-food credit growth at 
20.1 per cent in August 2011 was above the indicative projection of 18 per cent set out 
in the July Review.   
 
 Liquidity has remained in deficit, consistent with the stance of monetary 
policy. The daily average borrowings under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) were 
around ` 40,000 crore in September (up to September 15, 2011). Money and the 
government securities markets have remained orderly. In recent weeks, as a result of 
global risk aversion, the rupee has depreciated, which may have adverse implications 
for inflation. 
 
 Monetary transmission strengthened further with 45 scheduled commercial 
banks raising their Base Rates by 25-100 basis points after the July Review. 
Consequently, the modal base rate of banks rose to 10.75 per cent in August from 
10.25 per cent in July.   
 
Fiscal Conditions 
 The central government’s fiscal imbalances widened during April-July of 2011 
reflecting, primarily, the impact of decline in revenue receipts coupled with pressures 
from non-plan revenue expenditures on account of higher petroleum and fertiliser 
subsidies. Fiscal deficit at 55.4 per cent of the budget estimates in the first four months 
of the current fiscal was significantly higher than that of 42.5 per cent during the 
corresponding period last year (when adjusted for the more than budgeted spectrum 
proceeds).   
 
Summing Up 
 
4 
 To sum up, developments in the global economy over the past few weeks are a 
matter of serious concern. Growth momentum is weakening in the advanced economies 
amidst heightened concerns that recovery may take longer than expected earlier. 
Although India's exports have performed extremely well in the recent period, this trend is 
unlikely to be sustained in the face of weakening global demand. This, combined with the 
slowing down of domestic demand, to which the monetary policy stance is also 
contributing, suggests that risks to the growth projection for 2011-12 made in the July 
Review are on the downside.  
 Meanwhile, inflation remains high, generalised and much above the comfort 
zone of the Reserve Bank. After slight moderation in July, non-food manufactured 
products inflation rose again in August, suggesting continuing demand pressures.  
Global crude oil prices have remained elevated despite weakening of global recovery. 
Moreover, there is still an element of suppressed inflation. Though global oil prices have 
moderated, the pass-through to domestic prices remains incomplete. Also, current 
administered electricity prices are yet to reflect increase in input prices, even as many 
states have initiated increases. Food inflation is at near-double digit levels, despite 
normal monsoons, underlining the fact that it is being driven by structural demand-
supply imbalances and cannot be dismissed as a temporary phenomenon. The inflation 
momentum, reflected in the de-seasonalised sequential monthly data, persists. 
  
Expected Outcome 
 The policy action in this Review is expected to: 
• reinforce the impact of past policy actions to contain inflation and anchor 
inflationary expectations. 
Guidance 
   
The monetary tightening effected so far by the Reserve Bank has helped in 
containing inflation and anchoring inflationary expectations, though both remain at 
levels beyond the Reserve Bank’s comfort zone.  As monetary policy operates with a 
lag, the cumulative impact of policy actions should now be increasingly felt in further 
 
5moderation in demand and reversal of the inflation trajectory towards the later part of 
2011-12.  As such, a premature change in the policy stance could harden inflationary 
expectations, thereby diluting the impact of past policy actions. It is, therefore, 
imperative to persist with the current anti-inflationary stance. Going forward, the stance 
will be influenced by signs of downward movement in the inflation trajectory, to which 
the moderation in demand is expected to contribute, and the implications of global 
developments.
