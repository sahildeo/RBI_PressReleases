Reserve Bank Cancels the Licence of Chopda Urban Co-operative Bank Ltd., 
Jalgaon (Maharashtra) 
 
In view of the fact that Chopda Urban Co-operative Bank Ltd, Jalgaon, 
Maharashtra had ceased to be solvent, all efforts to revive it in close consultation 
with the Government of Maharashtra had failed and the depositors were being 
inconvenienced by continued uncertainty, the Reserve Bank of India delivered the 
order cancelling its licence to the bank before commencement of business on May 
24, 2011. The Registrar of Co-operative Societies, Maharashtra has also been 
requested to issue an order for winding up the bank and appoint a liquidator for the 
bank. It may be highlighted that on liquidation, every depositor is entitled to 
repayment of his/her deposits up to a monetary ceiling of ` 1,00,000/- (Rupees One 
lakh only) from the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) 
under usual terms and conditions.  
 
 The bank was granted a licence by Reserve Bank on October 30, 1999 to 
commence banking business. The statutory inspection of the bank with reference to 
its financial position as on March 31, 2009 assessed the CRAR at (-) 14.4%, 
negative networth of (-) Rs.184.43 lakh and erosion in deposits to the extent of 
13.1%. The Gross NPAs were 75.4% of its total loans and advances on that date.  
 
 The bank’s financial position further deteriorated with reference to its financial 
position as on March 31, 2010. The erosion in assets had not only wiped off the 
owned funds of the bank but also eroded its deposits to the extent of 25.4%. The 
CRAR of the bank was (-) 22.8% as against the prescribed minimum of 9%.  The 
losses were assessed at ` 567.04 lakh for the financial year ended March 31, 2010.  
The bank had sanctioned large loan limits titled as personal surety and cash credit 
and the loan amount was credited in savings account, which was subsequently 
allowed to be transferred to societies which were related to the Chairman / Directors 
of the bank. The bank had defaulted in the maintenance of SLR. 
 
   Due to its precarious financial position and irregularities / violations 
observed, the bank was placed under directions under Section 35 A of the Banking 
Regulation Act, 1949 (AACS) vide Directive UBD CO BSD-I No. D- 10/12.22.467/ 
2010-11 dated September 6, 2010. 
  
 Serious deficiencies as mentioned above revealed that the affairs of the bank 
were being conducted in a manner detrimental to the interests of the depositors. The 
bank did not comply with the provisions of Sections 11(1), 22(3)(a) & (b) and 24 of 
?????????? 2
the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (As Applicable to Co-operative Societies). The 
Registrar of Co-operative Societies vide his order dated September 16, 2010 
superseded the Board of the bank and appointed Board of Administrators. The bank 
vide its letter  dated September 27, 2010 represented to the Reserve Bank stating 
that during the last three months the bank had made substantial improvements by 
recovering non performing loans and augmenting share capital. The bank further 
stated that the CRAR and net worth have become positive with no erosion in 
deposits and there is no default in CRR and SLR. In view of the claims made by the 
bank regarding improvement in its financials, a scrutiny was carried out during the 
th th
period from October 26 to 28 , 2010 to verify the claims made by the bank. It was 
observed during the scrutiny that the financial position of the bank had further 
deteriorated. 
 
 Pursuant to the aforesaid serious deficiencies/irregularities and the 
deteriorating financial position of the bank, it was issued a notice vide letter dated 
March 1, 2011 to show cause (SCN) as to why the licence granted to the bank on 
October 30, 1999 to conduct banking business should not be cancelled. The bank 
submitted its reply to the SCN vide its letter dated March 31, 2011. The reply to the 
SCN was considered and examined but not found satisfactory.  Further, no concrete 
proposal was received from the bank for merger or any viable revival / restructuring 
plan. 
 
 Therefore, Reserve Bank  of India took the extreme measure of cancelling 
licence of the bank in the interest of bank's depositors. With the cancellation of 
licence and commencement of liquidation proceedings, the process of paying the 
depositors of the Chopda Urban Co-operative Bank Ltd, Jalgaon, Maharashtra, the 
amount insured as per the DICGC Act, will be set in motion subject to the terms and 
conditions of the Deposit Insurance Scheme. 
 
 Consequent to the cancellation of its licence, Chopda Urban Co-operative 
Bank Ltd, Jalgaon, Maharashtra is prohibited from carrying on ‘banking business’ as 
defined in Section 5(b) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (as applicable to co-
