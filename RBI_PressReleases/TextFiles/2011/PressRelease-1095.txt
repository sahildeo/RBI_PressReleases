Reserve Bank Cancels the Licence of  
Siddharth Sahakari Bank Ltd., Pune (Maharashtra) 
 
In view of the fact that Siddharth Sahakari Bank Ltd, Pune, Maharashtra had 
ceased to be solvent, all efforts to revive it in close consultation with the Government 
of Maharashtra had failed and the depositors were being inconvenienced by 
continued uncertainty, the Reserve Bank of India delivered the order cancelling its 
licence to the bank before commencement of business on June 14, 2011. The 
Registrar of Co-operative Societies, Maharashtra has also been requested to issue 
an order for winding up the bank and appoint a liquidator for the bank.  It may be 
highlighted that on liquidation, every depositor is entitled to repayment of his/her 
deposits up to a monetary ceiling of `1,00,000/- (Rupees One lakh only) from the 
Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) under usual terms 
and conditions.  
 
The bank was granted a licence by Reserve Bank on November 29, 1996 to 
commence banking business.  The statutory inspection of the bank with reference to 
its financial position as on March 31, 2010 had revealed that the financial parameters 
of the bank had deteriorated sharply. CRAR was assessed at (-) 86.8% as compared 
to (-) 19.2% as on March 31, 2009. Assessed Networth was (-) ` 375.17 lakh 
compared to (-) ` 415.12 lakh as on March 31, 2009. Erosion in deposits was to the 
extent of 33.6% compared to 10.8% as on March 31, 2009. The bank had also 
defaulted in maintenance of CRR and SLR.  The bank was advised by Reserve Bank 
at a meeting held on July 09, 2010 that it had a time of three months to show 
progress in the financial health of the bank, failing which Reserve Bank would be 
constrained to initiate the process to cancel the licence issued to the bank.  The 
bank was also advised at the above meeting, to explore the possibility of merger with 
a sound UCB. 
 
A scrutiny conducted with reference to the bank’s financial position as on 
September 30, 2010 had revealed further deterioration in its financial parameters.  
CRAR was (-) 90.3%, Net Worth was assessed at (-) ` 1463.41 lakh and Net Loss 
was assessed at ` 1723.70 lakh as on that date.  Additionally, the bank had apprised 
that it was facing severe liquidity problems due to heavy withdrawals from deposit 
accounts during September 2010.  The sponsorship of sub-membership of the bank 
to Pune Bankers’ Clearing House was withdrawn by Cosmos Co-operative Bank Ltd, 
Pune with effect from October 30, 2010 as the bank had failed to meet its clearing 
liability.

Due to precarious financial position and liquidity crunch faced by the bank, it 
was placed under directions under Section 35 A of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 
(AACS) vide Directive UBD CO BSD-I No. D-25/12.22.382/2010-11 dated December 
15, 2010 effective from close of business as on December 20, 2010. 
  
Serious deficiencies as mentioned above revealed that the affairs of the bank 
were being conducted in a manner detrimental to the interests of the depositors. The 
bank did not comply with the provisions of Sections 11(1), 18, 22(3)(a) & (b) and 24 
of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (As Applicable to Co-operative Societies). 
 
In view of the aforesaid serious deficiencies/irregularities and the deteriorating 
financial position of the bank, it was issued a notice on April 06, 2011 to show cause 
(SCN) as to why the licence granted to the bank on November 29, 1996 to conduct 
banking business should not be cancelled. The bank submitted its reply to the SCN 
vide its letter dated April 28, 2011. The reply to the SCN was considered and 
examined but not found satisfactory. Further, no concrete proposal was received 
from the bank for merger. 
 
Therefore, Reserve Bank of India took the extreme measure of cancelling 
licence of the bank in the interest of bank's depositors. With the cancellation of 
licence and commencement of liquidation proceedings, the process of paying the 
depositors of the Siddharth Sahakari Bank Ltd, Pune, Maharashtra will be set in 
motion subject to the terms and conditions of the Deposit Insurance Scheme. 
 
Consequent to the cancellation of its licence, Siddharth Sahakari Bank Ltd, 
Pune, Maharashtra is prohibited from carrying on ‘banking business’ as defined in 
Section 5(b) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (AACS).
