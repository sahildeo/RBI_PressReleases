Results of 15 Round (Q4:2010-11) 
of Survey of Professional Forecasters on Macroeconomic Indicators 
The Reserve Bank of India today released on its website the results of 
quarterly Survey of Professional Forecasters on major macroeconomic indicators of 
short to medium term economic developments. The survey covers forecast for 
quarter 4 of 2010-11, that is, January-March 2011.  
Done through a questionnaire responded by 25 forecasters who participated 
in this round, the survey covered component-wise detailed forecasts of GDP growth, 
inflation, savings, capital formation, consumption expenditure, export, import, interest 
rates, money supply, credit growth, stock market movements, corporate profit, etc.  
The Reserve Bank has been conducting this survey on a quarterly basis from 
the second quarter ended September 2007. It disseminates the survey results 
through its website on a regular basis. 
The results of the survey represent views of the respondent forecasters and in 
no way reflect the views or forecasts of the Reserve Bank of India.  
Some of the salient features of the survey are: 
1. Annual Forecasts:   
 
Overall & Sectoral Real GDP for 2011-12: 
 
• For 2011-12, Forecasters have revised their real GDP growth rate forecasts 
1
downwards to 8.2 per cent from 8.5 per cent as per the last survey. 
Projections for agriculture, industry and services growth are 3.1 per cent, 8.2 
per cent and 9.6 per cent, respectively.  For agriculture and industry, there is 
a downward revision and for services, there is an upward revision from the 
previous round of survey. The forecasters were asked to assign probabilities 
to the possibility that year-on-year real GDP growth rate would fall into various 
ranges. For 2011-12, they have assigned maximum probability of 38.2 per 
cent to 8.0-8.4 per cent growth range for GDP. The chart given below shows 
mean probability pattern of real GDP growth forecasts.

will fall in 7.0-7.9 per cent in end-March of 2011-12, with a downward bias
