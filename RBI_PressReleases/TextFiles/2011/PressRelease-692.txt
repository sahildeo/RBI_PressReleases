Banking Ombudsman Conference: 
Ten Action Points to improve Customer Service of Banks 
1. Indian Banks’ Association (IBA) will standardise most important terms and 
conditions (MITC) for at least ten important banking transactions and circulate 
among banks for adaptation.  
2. Banks would initiate the process of providing one view of all bank accounts of a 
customer including deposits, loans, etc., with the help of available technology, 
such as, core banking solution. Banks would be complete the process within one 
year.   
3. Banks would convey to the Reserve Bank, a consensus view on the 
recommendations of the Damodaran Committee Report on Customer Service in 
Banks that could be immediately implemented. 
4. To create awareness about the Banking Ombudsman Scheme, the Banking 
Ombudsmen will annually share with local media, information regarding 
complaints received and resolved, including important cases and awards given. 
5. A series of town-hall events will be organised by banks to generate awareness 
about customer service in banks.  Bank customers, bank officials and Banking 
Ombudsmen will participate in these events. 
6. The Reserve Bank/IBA would examine the issues pertaining to monetary 
compensation for mental harassment suffered by bank customers.  Issues that 
may receive attention in the analysis would be: 
? Whether only actual loss should be considered for compensation   
? Whether mental harassment issues can be codified for compensation and 
whether compensation should be capped  
? Whether the policies of the banks’ boards on compensation should 
include mental harassment as a ground for compensation 
7. Banks should issue tax deduction at source (TDS) certificates duly completed in 
all respects to the account holders and despatch it to their mailing address.  
8. In case of ATM/Internet based banking transactions, in the event of any 
monetary dispute involving the customer and the bank, the onus should be on 
the bank to prove the customer’s negligence or mistake.  Customer must be 
compensated for the losses arising out of customers’ non-authorised 
transactions.  
9. Banks’ should initiate steps to incorporate in their code of  ‘Fair Practices to the 
Customers’ the following items - 
? Insurance of some reasonable amount  on their customers’ credit and 
debit card transactions 
? Providing periodical loan statements to small borrowers  
? Borrowers should be conveyed information on the annualised all-in cost 
(Annual Effective Rate) on their loan accounts.

10.  Banks must not recover pre-payment charges in floating rate loans. Banks may 
also offer long-term fixed rate housing loans to their customers and address their 
asset liability mismatch (ALM) issues by recourse to the Interest Rate Swaps 
(IRS) market.  Floating rate loans pass on the interest rate risk from banks which 
are much better placed to manage it to borrowers and, thus, banks only 
substitute interest rate risk with potential credit risk. The bank will, however, be 
free to recover / charge appropriate pre-payment penalties in the case of fixed 
rate loans.   
These decisions were taken at the Annual Conference of Banking Ombudsmen 
held in the Reserve Bank of India, Mumbai on September 5, 2011. The Conference was 
inaugurated by Dr. D Subbarao, Governor, Reserve Bank of India.  In his inaugural 
remarks, he stated that, often, prevention was better than cure. In customer service 
area too, rendering good customer service was like ‘prevention’ and was better than the 
‘cure’ which was the various grievances redressal mechanisms. He flagged various 
issues relating to banks’ customer service for the consideration of the participants. He 
asked whether customer service was a criterion in evaluating the performance of a 
branch level official or did levying of penalty on a bank reflected in any manner on the 
staff which caused the levy of penalty; do all banks have customer grievances redressal 
officer and at what level; were the most important terms and conditions (MITC) 
explained to the bank customers before they signed the documents; and whether the 
deviation from most important terms and conditions of a banking product transparent. 
He urged bankers to identify ten action points to further improve their customer service. 
Dr. K.C. Chakrabarty, Deputy Governor, chaired the Conference. All fifteen 
Banking Ombudsmen, Shri M.D. Mallya, Chairman, Indian Banks’ Association and 
Chairman and Managing Director, Bank of Baroda, Shri Pratip Chaudhuri, Chairman,

Association, Smt. K.J. Udeshi, Chairperson and Shri N. Raja, Chief Executive Officer,

Director, welcomed the participants and Shri Rajesh Verma, Chief General Manager in 
charge of Customer Service Department proposed a vote of thanks.  
Background
The Reserve Bank notified the Banking Ombudsman Scheme in 1995. The 
Scheme provides for a system of quick and inexpensive redressal of customer 
grievances against banks. The Banking Ombudsman Scheme covers a wide range of 
complaints concerning deficiency in banking service. The Scheme also allows appeals 
from complainants and banks in respect of decisions made by the Banking 
Ombudsman. The Scheme was revised twice - in 2002 and 2006 to expand its scope 
and coverage. The Scheme, as last amended in 2009, includes complaints for 
deficiencies arising out of internet banking, non-adherence to the provisions of the Fair 
Practices Code for lenders or the Code of Bank's Commitment to Customers issued by 
the Banking Codes and Standards Board of India (BCSBI) and non-observance of the 
Reserve Bank guidelines on engagement of recovery agents by banks. In addition, the 
Reserve Bank has also simplified the format for lodging complaint to the Banking 
Ombudsman.  
The Reserve Bank organises a conference of all the Banking Ombudsmen every 
year. Senior officials from the Banking Codes and Standards Board of India, Indian 
Banks’ Association, Credit Information Bureau of India Limited (CIBIL) and some 
leading banks are also invited to the Conference for meaningful interaction. Various 
issues relating to customer service and regulatory measures for improving customer 
service in the banking sector are discussed in the conference.
