Reserve Bank Cancels the license of The Charminar  
Co-operative Urban Bank Ltd., Hyderabad (Andhra Pradesh) 
In view of the fact that the operations of The Charminar Co-operative Urban 
Bank Ltd., (Andhra Pradesh) had ceased to be solvent, all efforts to turnaround in 
consultations with the Government of Andhra Pradesh had failed and the depositors 
were being inconvenienced by continued uncertainty, the Reserve Bank of India 
delivered the order dated November 08, 2011 canceling its license to the bank after 
the close of business on November 15, 2011. The Registrar of Co-operative 
Societies, Andhra Pradesh State has also been requested to issue an order for 
winding up the bank and appoint a liquidator for the bank.  It may be highlighted that 
on liquidation, every depositor is entitled to repayment of his/her deposits up to a 
monetary ceiling of ` 1,00,000/- (Rupees one lakh only) from the Deposit Insurance 
and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) under usual terms and conditions, if he / 
she has not received the same as per the Scheme of Reconstruction notified by the 
Government of Andhra Pradesh under Section 115 (B) (i) of the Andhra Pradesh Co-
operative Societies Act, 1964 vide GO. MS. No. 4 dated February 27, 2003.    
2   The bank was granted a license by Reserve Bank on September 24, 1985 to 
commence banking business.  Based on the findings of the inspection conducted 
with reference to its financial position as on September 30, 2001, Operational 
Instructions under Section 36 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (As Applicable to 
Co-operative Societies) [B. R. Act, 1949 (AACS)] were issued to the bank on 
January 2, 2002 imposing, inter alia, certain restrictions on its acceptance, / payment 
of deposits as also on lending. However, the liquidity position continued to remain 
critical.  
3. The scrutiny conducted by RBI in February 2002 revealed that the bank was 
not in a position to meet the demand of its depositors. In order to protect the interest 
of the depositors, directions under Section 35 of the B. R. Act, 1949 (AACS) were 
issued to the bank from the close of business on February 25, 2002 restricting, inter 
alia, acceptance of any fresh deposits and repayment of deposits to a maximum of    
` 1000/- per depositor. The bank’s Board was superseded on March 2, 2002 and 
Registrar of Co-operative Societies (RCS), Andhra Pradesh appointed a Persons-in-
Charge (PIC) Committee to manage the affairs of the bank. 
4. With a view to restructure and revive the bank, the Government of Andhra 
Pradesh notified a Scheme of Reconstruction in consultation with RBI which came 
into force with effect from March 3, 2003. Consequently, directions issued under 
Section 35A of BR Act, 1949 (AACS) were revoked. The Scheme, however, failed to 
yield the desired results. The subsequent inspections of the bank also revealed no 
improvement in its financial position.

5.    The statutory inspection of the bank conducted with reference to its financial 
position as on March 31, 2010 and the scrutiny carried out with reference to its 
financial position as on March 31, 2011 revealed no improvement in the functioning 
of the bank. Its net worth and CRAR as on March 31, 2011 were assessed at            
(-)` 137.33 crore and (-) 999.9 per cent. The entire loan portfolio was assessed as 
impaired and the entire deposits were considered as eroded.  
6.    In terms of revised restructuring scheme, the bank for all its depositors having 
deposits above ` 10 lakh were to be paid the balance amount in 8 equal half yearly 
th
installments starting from March 2009. It was observed that the last installment(5 ) 
was paid not out of the cash generated from recovery of NPAs but by disposing off 
the fixed deposits maintained with other banks. The bank itself accepted that any 
further recovery in NPA accounts were not possible. Without any further recovery in 
NPA accounts, the bank can hardly make repayment of the next installments.  
7. From the facts and circumstances mentioned above it is observed that: 
i) The bank is not complying with the provision of Sections 11(1) 22(3)(a) 
and 22(3)(b) of the Act. 
ii) The bank is not in a position to pay its depositors in full, as and when 
their claims accrue. 
iii) The affairs of the bank are being conducted in a manner detrimental to 
the interests of its depositors. 
iv) The financial position of the bank leaves no scope for revival. 
v) In all likelihood, the public interest will be adversely affected if the bank 
is allowed to carry on  banking business 
9.    The Reserve Bank of India issued a show cause notice to the bank on July 
14, 2011, asking it to show cause as to why the license granted to it to conduct 
banking business should not be cancelled. In the reply to the show cause notice, the 
bank has not submitted any action plan for revival and its reply to the show cause 
notice was not found satisfactory. In the absence of any viable action plan to 
turnaround, Reserve Bank of India took the extreme measure of canceling the 
license of the bank in the interest of the bank's depositors. With the cancellation of its 
license and commencement of liquidation proceedings, the process of paying the 
depositors of The Charminar Co-operative Urban Bank Ltd., Hyderabad (Andhra 
Pradesh) will be set in motion subject to the terms and conditions of the Deposit 
Insurance Scheme.   
10.  Consequent to the cancellation of its licence, The Charminar Co-operative 
Urban Bank Ltd., (Andhra Pradesh), is prohibited from carrying on ‘banking business’ 
as defined in Section 5(b) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (AACS) including 
acceptance and repayment of deposits.
