RBI opens Sub-Office in Agartala; 
Inaugurates Exhibition on RBI History 
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) today opened its sub-office at Agartala. 
Tripura will be the second State in the North-East region to have an RBI office. The 
new office was inaugurated by Shri Manik Sarkar, Hon’ble Chief Minister of Tripura. 
Dr. D. Subba Rao, Governor, Reserve Bank of India presided over the inaugural 
function. The Hon’ble Finance Minister of the State, Shri Badal Choudhury and other 
senior officials of the State Government also attended the function. 
The new RBI office is housed at Jackson Gate building in Agartala and will 
function under the charge of a General Manager. The office is expected to initially 
focus on development of banking in the State and gradually take up other 
central banking functions.  
Earlier, the Reserve Bank of India Governor inaugurated the exhibition titled 
Mint Road Milestones in Agartala. The exhibition Mint Road Milestones is based on a 
book with the same title published by the Reserve Bank during its Platinum Jubilee 
last year. The book is an attempt to document the journey of the Reserve Bank down 
75 years through many anecdotes, photographs, documents and interesting visuals. 
The narrative of the book intertwines the history of the central bank with the financial 
history of the country and world developments of the time. The exhibition is an 
attempt to bring the book closer to the common person. A large section of this 
exhibition is, therefore, through the news items and photographs published in 
newspapers. The exhibition also displays internal documents and photographs, tells 
the story and the context of the Reserve Bank’s policy measures and gives glimpses 
of how the newspapers and media viewed the policies of the Reserve Bank.  
The exhibition, located on the Second Floor of The Agartala Press Club, 
Sachin Debbarman Sarani, Agartala, West Tripura-799001, will remain open for 
public viewing from May 19, 2011 till May 27, 2011 from 10:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.
