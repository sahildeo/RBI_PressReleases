RBI Releases Draft Guidelines on Basel III Capital Regulations  
The Reserve Bank today released on its website, draft guidelines outlining 
proposed implementation of Basel III capital regulation in India. These guidelines are 
in response to the comprehensive reform package entitled “Basel III: A global 
regulatory framework for more resilient banks and banking systems” of the Basel 
Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) issued in December 2010.  
The major highlights of the draft guidelines are: 
Minimum Capital Requirements 
• Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital must be at least 5.5% of risk-weighted 
assets (RWAs); 
• Tier 1 capital must be at least 7% of RWAs; and 
• Total capital must be at least 9% of RWAs. 
Capital Conservation Buffer 
• The capital conservation buffer in the form of Common Equity of 2.5% of 
RWAs.  
Transitional Arrangements 
• It is proposed that the implementation period of minimum capital requirements 
and deductions from Common Equity will begin from January 1, 2013 and be 
fully implemented as on March 31, 2017. 
 
• Capital conservation buffer requirement is proposed to be implemented 
between March 31, 2014 and March 31, 2017. 
 
• The implementation schedule indicated above will be finalized taking into 
account the feedback received on these guidelines.  
 
• Instruments which no longer qualify as regulatory capital instruments will be 
phased-out during the period beginning from January 1, 2013 to March 31, 
2022. 
Enhancing Risk Coverage 
• For OTC derivatives, in addition to the capital charge for counterparty default 
risk under Current Exposure Method, banks will be required to compute an 
additional credit value adjustments (CVA) risk capital charge.

minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5%. The leverage ratio requirement will be 
finalized taking into account the final proposal of the Basel Committee.
