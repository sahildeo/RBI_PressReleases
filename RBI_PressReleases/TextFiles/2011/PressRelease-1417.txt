WMA Limits for Government of India fixed  
for the Financial Year 2011-12 
 
It has been decided in consultation with the Government of India that the 
limits for Ways and Means Advances (WMA) for the financial year 2011-12 would be: 
Rs. 30,000 crore for April 01, 2011 to April 20, 2011 
Rs.45,000 crore for April 21, 2011 to June 30, 2011

Rs. 10,000 crore for October 01, 2011 to March 31, 2012   
 
The Reserve Bank may trigger fresh floatation of market loans when the 
Government of India utilises 75 per cent of the WMA limit.  
The Reserve Bank would retain the flexibility to revise the limits at any time, in 
consultation with the Government of India, taking into consideration the prevailing 
circumstances. 
 
The interest rate on WMA/overdraft will be: 
 
a) Ways and Means Advances:  Repo Rate 
b) Overdraft:  Two percent above the Repo Rate 
The minimum balance required to be maintained by the Government of India 
with the Reserve Bank of India will not be less than Rs.100 crore on Fridays, on the 
date of closure of Government of India's financial year and on June 30, i.e., closure 
of the annual accounts of the Reserve Bank of India and not less than Rs.10 crore 
on other days. 
As per the provisions of the agreement dated March 26, 1997 between the 
Government of India and the Reserve Bank of India, overdrafts beyond ten 
consecutive working days will not be allowed.
