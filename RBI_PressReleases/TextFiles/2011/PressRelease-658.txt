RBI penalises Credit Agricole – Corporate & Investment Bank and Karnataka 
Bank for Non-Compliance with Its Directives on Derivatives 
The Reserve Bank of India has imposed a penalty of Rs.10 lakh (Rupees Ten 
Lakh only) on Credit Agricole – Corporate & Investment Bank and a penalty of Rs. Five 
lakh (Rupees five lakh only) on Karnataka Bank Limited for non-compliance with its 
directives on derivatives. 
The penalty on Credit Agricole – Corporate & Investment Bank has been 
imposed for failing to carry out proper due diligence on user appropriateness and 
suitability of products and the compliance function in the bank failing to ensure strict 
observance of all statutory provisions contained in various legislations, issued by the 
Reserve Bank in respect of derivative transactions. 
The penalty on Karnataka Bank Limited has been imposed for failing to carry out proper 
due diligence on user appropriateness and suitability of products and failing to 
document the pricing, periodical valuation of products and quantifying financial risks in 
derivatives.  
The Reserve Bank had issued show cause notice to both the banks. The banks 
submitted their written replies in response to the Reserve Bank. On a careful 
examination of the banks’ responses and their oral submissions made during the 
personal hearings, the Reserve Bank found that the violations were conclusively 
established. The Reserve Bank of India therefore penalised these banks in exercise of 
the powers vested with it under the provisions of Section 47A(1)(b) read with Section 
46(4)(i) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949.
