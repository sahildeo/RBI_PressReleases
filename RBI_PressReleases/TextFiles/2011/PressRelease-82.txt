RBI Book titled Regional Economy of India: Growth and Finance released 
Dr. Subir Gokarn, Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India released a book 
on Regional Economy of India: Growth and Finance last Friday at the Annual 
Conference of the economists of the Reserve Bank of India. Edited by Shri Deepak 
Mohanty, Executive Director, Reserve Bank of India, the book is jointly published by 
the Reserve Bank of India and the Academic Foundation.  
The book covers important research findings of economists working in 
regional offices of the Reserve Bank of India. Given the divergence in growth 
potential, financial development and inflation across regions in India, studies on 
regional economies become particularly relevant. The analysis in the book reveals 
that - 
• The share of agriculture has shrunk across the states  
• the share of services has risen sharply  
• However, industrial growth remains uneven.  
• Urban-rural inequality has worsened.  
• There is, therefore, a need for concerted action on agricultural growth 
and infrastructure development besides increasing the penetration of 
formal financial sector to alleviate the constraints on growth and to 
control inflation.  
• There is also a need to prioritise expenditure towards social sector to 
develop the quality of the labour force and promote well-being. 
The book is available from Academic Foundation, 4772-73/23, Bharat Ram 
Road (23, Ansari Road), Darya Ganj, New Delhi-110002, India. E-mail .
