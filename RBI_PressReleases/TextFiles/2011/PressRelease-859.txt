Smt. Shashi Rekha Rajagopalan, RBI Board Member expires 
Smt. Shashi Rekha Rajagopalan, a member of the Central Board of Directors of 
the Reserve Bank of India, and a member of the Board for Financial Services 
constituted by the Reserve Bank Board expired this morning in Hyderabad. She was 60 
and leaves behind her mother and other family members.  
Condoling the sad demise of Smt. Rajagopalan, Dr. D Subbarao, Governor, 
Reserve Bank of India said, “Shashi's death is an irreplaceable loss for the entire RBI 
family. The RBI Board benefitted enormously from her deep knowledge of the frontline 
credit delivery systems of the country, her strong sense of conviction and above all her 
compassion for the less privileged. She is truly one of the millions of unsung heroes of 
our country.” 
Smt. Rajagopalan was a freelance consultant with special interests in 
organisational design, structuring and development of user-based and voluntary 
development organisations, planning/envisioning in user-based and voluntary 
development organisations, accounts and financial systems, user-owned and controlled 
financial and other business development and cooperative legislation. She was also a 
member of the Board of Directors of NABARD and Chairperson of the Audit Committee 
constituted by its Board.  
Born on July 21, 1951 in Madurai, Tamil Nadu, Smt. Rajagopalan was a B.Sc. 
(Hons) in Mathematics from Calcutta University. She categorised her work in four broad 
phases. In the first phase, between 1970 and 1975 she served as a volunteer with 
Service Civil International, an international pacifist organisation working against 
conscription. She worked closely with disadvantaged communities, living in conditions 
and with income similar to them. During the second phase between 1975 and 1977, 
she served Hyderabad Archdiocese Social Service Society and worked on maternal 
and child health centres. In the third phase between 1978 and 1998, Smt. Rajagopalan 
worked with Cooperative Development Foundation and its associate organisations and 
worked on advocacy for change in cooperative law, management of a revolving fund for 
the promotion of cooperative (non-financial) businesses and design and promotion of 
new types of cooperatives. The fourth phase of her worklife as a freelance consultant 
started in January 1999 when she took various assignments focussing on studies, 
training and drafting manuscripts for publication on the subject of savings and credit 
cooperatives. 
Smt. Rajagopalan was a member on the Brahm Perkash Committee constituted 
by the Planning Commission in 1989, the first of a series of initiatives that led to reforms 
in cooperative law. She also worked closely with the Government in Andhra Pradesh on 
the AP Mutually Aided Cooperative Societies Act, 1995. The Governments of Bihar, 
Punjab, Karnataka, Jammu and Kashmir, and Orissa, too, had invited her to help 
reform cooperative law. The International Labour Organisation had invited her to 
Geneva, to participate as a member of an Expert Committee to review 
Recommendation 127 on cooperatives.
