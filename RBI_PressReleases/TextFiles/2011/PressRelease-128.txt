Milestones in RBI's History : A Newsibition in Mumbai 
Smt. Usha Thorat, Director, Center for Advanced Financial Research and 
Learning (CAFRAL) and former Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India 
inaugurated the Reserve Bank of India’s Newsibition today at the Reserve Bank of 
India, First Floor, Byculla Office, (Opposite Mumbai Central Railway Station), 
Mumbai - 400 008.  
The Newsibition is part of the Reserve Bank’s outreach and financial literacy 
efforts. Apart from demystifying the Reserve Bank and its functions, the Newsibition 
endeavours to depict the 76 years of the Reserve Bank's history. It is 
called ‘Newsibition’ as it largely depicts the Reserve Bank's history through 
newspaper clippings and photographs. The 'Newsibition' also has some rare 
documents from the Reserve Bank's archives. It gives a glimpse of the spirit of the 
times and events not only as they happened but also how they were viewed by the 
public at large through media reports. 
The display is divided into nine sections representing different phases in the 
Reserve Bank’s evolution. These take the viewer down 76 years of central banking 
history covering critical events and policies. The Newsibition weaves the history of 
the Reserve Bank with the country's economic history. The Newsibition also 
captures some interesting anecdotes and stories.  
 In addition to the history of the Reserve Bank, the Newsibition also has panels 
and film on currency and its security features as also, games/activities that will help 
young students learn about economy, central banking, banking and finance in fun 
way.  
The Exhibition will remain open for public viewing from December 12, 2011 
till January 14, 2012, between 10 am and 6 pm, including Saturdays and Sundays.
