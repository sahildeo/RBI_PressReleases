RBI Measures to extend Credit Support to Micro Finance Institutions  
 
The Reserve Bank of India has today advised certain relaxation to banks in its 
present restructuring guidelines in order to enable them to extend credit support 
to micro finance institutions (MFIs). The relaxation is purely a temporary measure 
and would be applicable to bank loans to MFIs restructured by banks up to 
March 31, 2011, the Reserve Bank has stated.  
 
Relaxation considered 
The Reserve Bank has asked banks to extend the regulatory asset classification 
benefit to standard restructured MFI accounts, even if they were not fully 
secured. This relaxation was given considering the fact that the problems 
afflicting the MFI sector were not necessarily on account of any credit weakness 
per-se but were mainly due to environmental factors. This measure initiated by 
the Reserve Bank is expected to impart some liquidity support by banks to MFIs 
and facilitate a ‘holding on’ operation for some time till the Malegam Committee 
submits its report and measures are taken to bring about long term and structural 
changes in the functioning of MFIs. The Reserve Bank has also advised banks 
that they should endeavour to recycle the collections to MFIs so as to ensure that 
the intended ‘holding on’ operation is successful.   
 
 
 
?nullnull???nullnullnull??Background 
The Reserve Bank of India had held discussions with select banks on December 
22, 2010 to get an assessment regarding the ground level situation in 
microfinance sector in Andhra Pradesh and other States and the need for any 
interim measures. The banks informed that collections by MFIs in Andhra 
Pradesh had deteriorated considerably and there were some incipient signs of 
contagion spreading to other States. Subsequently, the Indian Banks’ 
Association (IBA) based on the banks’ feedback came up with a proposal that 
there was a need for extending certain relaxations in the restructuring guidelines 
of the Reserve Bank for the MFI sector. It observed that bank loans to MFIs were 
mostly unsecured but to avail of the regulatory asset classification benefits under 
the present restructuring guidelines of the Reserve Bank, the accounts had to be 
fully secured. The banks had also stressed on the need to work out an interim 
arrangement involving, among other things, rescheduling of exposures to MFIs 
subject to certain covenants, such as, MFIs agreeing to reduce their leverage 
and growth projections.
