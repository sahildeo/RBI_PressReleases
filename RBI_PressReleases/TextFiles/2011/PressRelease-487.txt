 RBI Working Paper Series No.13 for September 2011 
 The Reserve Bank of India today placed Working Paper titled "Long Run and 
Short Run Saving-Investment Relationship in India" by Bichitrananda Seth. Savings 
are the backbone of investment, wherein higher savings lead to higher growth in an 
economy with conducive macroeconomic environment and a developed financial 
system. This Working Paper examines short and long run relationship between gross 
domestic savings and investment as well as corporate sector savings and corporate 
sector investment in India using Engel Granger Cointegration test for the period 
between 1980 and 2008.  
From the empirical analysis, the paper concludes that the gross domestic 
savings and investment are cointegrated. This underlines the point that the domestic 
investment is mostly financed by domestic savings. In the short run, changes in 
domestic savings effect domestic investment. Further, their findings show that 
corporates generate their savings from the retained earnings. Hence, any downward 
disturbance in retained earnings will reduce their savings and investment in the short 
run.   
According to the findings of the paper, there is a need for strengthening the 
financial system in order to effectively channelize household savings for 
enhancement of capital formation in India. 
The Reserve Bank of India introduced in April this year, a ‘RBI Working Paper 
Series’ (RBI - WP) to provide a platform to the Reserve Bank Staff for presenting 
their research studies as well as to receive feedback from informed researchers.   
The views expressed in all the research publications of the Reserve Bank, 
including the RBI Working Papers Series, do not necessarily reflect the views of the 
Reserve Bank and as such should not be reported as representing the views of the 
Reserve Bank of India.  
Feedback, if any, on the papers could be addressed to the respective authors 
of the research studies.
