RBI releases Statistical Tables Relating to Banks in India 2009-10 
 The Reserve Bank of India today released the Statistical Tables Relating to 
Banks in India – an annual publication that provides key information on banks.  
The publication covers bank-wise and bank group-wise information on major 
items, such as, liabilities and assets, income and expenses, non-performing assets, 
financial ratios, spatial distribution of offices, number of employees and details of 
priority sector advances. It also provides bank group-wise monthly data on some of 
the major items, such as, aggregate deposits, liabilities to the banking system, 
assets with the banking system, investments, bank credit and sector-wise and 
industry-wise gross bank credit. 
 The analysis of the data presented in the publication shows that –  
• The profitability of all scheduled commercial banks at aggregate level declined 
in 2009-10.  
• At bank group level, while return on assets of “Public Sector Banks” and 
“Foreign Banks” declined and in respect of “Private Sector Banks” it improved 
in 2009-10.  
• There has been an increase in the number of employees in the banking sector 
during 2009-10 over 2008-09.  
• At bank group level, the number of employees of “Nationalised Banks” and 
“Private Sector Banks” increased, while the number of employees of “SBI & its 
Associates” and “Foreign Banks” declined in 2009-10.
