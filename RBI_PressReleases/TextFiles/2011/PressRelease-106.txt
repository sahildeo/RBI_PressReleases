Risk Management and Inter Bank Dealings 
 
Keeping in view the developments in the foreign exchange market, it has 
been decided to implement the following measures with immediate effect until further 
review. 
 
i. Under contracted exposures, forward contracts, involving the Rupee as 
one of the currencies, booked by residents to hedge current account 
transactions, regardless of the tenor, and to hedge capital account 
transactions, falling due within one year, were allowed to be cancelled and 
rebooked. 
 
It has now been decided to withdraw the above facility. Forward contracts 
booked by residents irrespective of the type and tenor of the underlying 
exposure, once cancelled, cannot be rebooked. 
 
ii. Under probable exposures based on past performance residents were 
allowed to hedge currency risk on the basis of a declaration of an 
exposure and based on past performance up to the average of the 
previous three financial years’ (April to March) actual import/export 
turnover or the previous year’s actual import/export turnover, whichever is 
higher. Further, contracts booked in excess of 75 per cent of the eligible 
limit were to be on deliverable basis and could not be cancelled. 
 
It has now been decided that  
 
a. For importers availing of the above past performance facility, the facility 
stands reduced to 25 percent of the limit as computed above, i.e., 25 percent 
of the average of the previous three financial years’ (April to March) actual 
import/export turnover or the previous year’s actual import/export turnover, 
whichever is higher. In case of importers who have already utilised in excess 
of the revised / reduced limit, no further bookings may be allowed under this 
facility.  
b. All forward contracts booked under this facility by both exporters and 
importers hence forth will be on fully deliverable basis. In case of 
cancellations, exchange gain, if any, should not be passed on to the 
customer.

iii. All cash/tom/spot transactions by the Authorised Dealers on behalf of 
clients will be undertaken for actual remittances / delivery only and cannot 
be cancelled / cash settled. 
 
iv. Foreign Institutional Investors  (FIIs) are currently allowed to hedge 
currency risk on the market value of entire investment in equity and/or debt 
in India as on a particular date. The contracts once cancelled cannot be 
rebooked except to the extent of 10 per cent of the market value of the 
portfolio as at the beginning of the financial year. The forward contracts 
may, however, be rolled over on or before maturity. 
 
It has now been decided that henceforth forward contracts booked by the 
FIIs, once cancelled, cannot be rebooked. The forward contracts may, 
however, be rolled over on or before maturity. 
 
v. The Board of Directors of Authorised Dealers were allowed to fix suitable 
limits for various Treasury functions with net overnight open exchange 
position and aggregate gap limits required to be approved by the Reserve 
Bank. 
 
It has now been decided that 
 
a. Net Overnight Open Position Limit (NOOPL) of Authorised Dealers would be 
reduced across the board. Revised limits in respect of individual banks are 
being advised to the Authorised Dealers separately. 
  
b. Intra-day open position / daylight limit of Authorised Dealers should not 
exceed the existing NOOPL approved by the Reserve Bank. 
 
c. The above arrangement would be reviewed on an ongoing basis keeping in 
view the evolving market conditions.

15, 2011.
