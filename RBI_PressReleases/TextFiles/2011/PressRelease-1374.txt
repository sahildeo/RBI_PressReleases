Macroeconomic and Monetary Developments in 2010-11  
The Reserve Bank of India today released the Macroeconomic and Monetary 
Developments in 2010-11. The document serves as a background to the Monetary 
Policy Statement 2011-12 to be announced on May 3, 2011.  
Overall Outlook   
Persistence of inflation warrants continuation of anti-inflationary monetary policy 
stance for sustaining growth over the medium term  
• Growth in 2011-12 is expected to stay close to the trend. Growth risks emanate 
from high oil prices and some moderation in investment. Business expectations 
surveys exhibit moderation. Survey of professional forecasters also predicts 
weaker growth and firmer inflation.   
 
• Inflation may remain elevated for some more time despite the current anti-
inflationary bias in the monetary stance. Upside risks to inflation arise from high 
oil and other commodity prices, incomplete pass through and its likely impact on 
fiscal deficit, elevated inflation expectations and price stickiness. 
 
• Going forward, policy trade-offs may arise as downside risks to growth and 
upside risks to inflation have increased. High global crude oil and other 
commodity prices pose a risk to growth and inflation. Experience suggests that 
high growth phases have coexisted with low inflation. 
Global Economic Conditions  
Recovery outpacing expectations, but oil, Euro-zone risks remain 
• Even as recovery remains multi-speed, growth in both, advanced economies and 
emerging/developing economies, outpaced initial expectations. This raises 
hopes for sustained, though moderately paced global recovery during 2011. 
  
• Global recovery has advanced, but downside risk to global growth arises from oil 
prices and significant sovereign and banking sector default risks. 
 
• Global inflation risks have risen significantly over the last quarter, not just in 
emerging markets but also in advanced economies. The pressures for rate cycle 
turning even in advanced economies can no longer be ignored. 
Indian Economy  
Output  
Economy grew around its trend, likely to sustain close to the trend 
• GDP growth during 2010-11 reverted to its recent trend, aided by a rebound in 
agricultural growth. Non-agricultural growth, however, was slightly below trend.

• Industrial growth decelerated in the second half on account of high base effect 
and moderation in investment demand. Manufacturing activity was spread more 
evenly and the recent slowdown in IIP was exacerbated by volatility in output of 
a few industries. 
 
• Services sector exhibited sustained momentum in 2010-11, though most 
services decelerated somewhat in Q3 of the year. 
 
• Growth momentum is likely to sustain close to trend in 2011-12 aided by 
predicted normal monsoon, demand conditions and positive lead indicators for 
services. Risks to growth, however, arise from input cost pressures. 
Aggregate Demand  
Aggregate demand remained robust, government spending decelerated on fiscal 
consolidation 
• Demand conditions were supportive of growth in 2010-11. Private consumption 
and investment were the key drivers, even though aggregate investment 
moderated in Q3. Investment intentions of the corporate also moderated further 
in Q3 after beginning to moderate from the previous quarter. 
 
• Government consumption expenditure decelerated in 2010-11 reflecting 
resumption in fiscal consolidation. This rebalancing should be maintained. 
  
• The key fiscal indicators of the Central Government showed an improvement in 
2010-11 (RE). However, the key deficit indicators are likely to remain above 
th 
those recommended by the 13 Finance Commission.   
 
• Expenditure on subsidies is subject to upside risks. Fertiliser and oil subsidies 
are likely to exceed budgetary provisions and generate pressures on fiscal 
situation in case there is a delay in adjusting the domestic prices to rise in 
international prices.    
External Economy  
Concerns on current account deficit receded, but not dissipated  
• Current account deficit (CAD) in 2010-11 is likely to be around 2.5 per cent of 
GDP, having moderated in Q3 of 2010-11 with significant acceleration in exports.   
 
• While concerns on CAD have receded, the spike in oil prices poses the risk of 
CAD widening in 2011-12. 
 
• The decline in FDI, volatility in portfolio flows and rising debt flows pose risk to 
CAD sustainability, though pressures on financing CAD have eased.  
   
• The impact of Middle East and North Africa (MENA) unrest can be significant 
while that of Japan’s natural disaster will be marginal. The affected economies’ 
share in India’s trade is not large. However, oil constitutes about one-third of 
India’s total imports. Further, there may be some transitory impact on investment 
flows from Japan.  
 
Monetary and Liquidity Conditions  
Monetary and liquidity conditions remained consistent with the anti-inflationary 
bias 
• Monetary and liquidity conditions responded, though with a lag, as monetary 
policy was continually tightened through the year. Tight liquidity conditions eased  3
somewhat during Q4 of 2010-11 as structural and frictional liquidity drivers 
eased. 
 
• Even as reserve money growth remained strong, money supply growth stayed 
below indicative trajectory. Lower growth in aggregate deposits and reduction in 
money multiplier emanating from higher currency demand led to this divergent 
trend. 
 
• Credit growth was above the indicated trajectory, though it moderated in later 
part of 2010-11. Deposit growth picked up, responding to a rise in interest rates. 
 
• Growth momentum has continued so far, though inflation has remained elevated. 
Risk to growth from high persistent inflation could condition the stance of 
monetary policy in near term. 
Financial Markets  
Stronger monetary transmission impacted interest rates 
• Monetary transmission strengthened in Q4 of 2010-11 with interest rates firming 
up gradually across the spectrum as liquidity remained in deficit mode. Deposit 
rates rose rapidly to accommodate rise in credit amidst tight liquidity. Banks 
progressively passed on the increased costs in the form of higher lending rates. 
 
• Money market rates firmed up reflecting tight liquidity conditions. The yield curve 
flattened in Q4 of 2010-11 reflecting monetary actions and lower budgeted 
borrowings. Equity markets witnessed an orderly correction during the quarter. 
Rupee remained stable and orderly without any interventions. 
Price Situation  
Inflation emanating from supply-side shocks increasingly became generalised  
• Headline inflation exhibited strong persistence in 2010-11 due to supply-side 
shocks and gradual generalisation of price pressures.  
 
• Inflation drivers have changed over three distinct phases. Headline inflation 
during 2010-11 was impacted primarily by food inflation during April-July, by 
primary non-food articles during August-November and in a more generalised 
manner by non-food manufacturing articles since December 2010. 
 
• Inflation path remains sticky and risks are on the upside. Headline inflation could 
remain elevated in the first half of 2011-12 before declining gradually in the 
second half, but could remain above the Reserve Bank’s comfort level. 
 
• Passthrough of global commodity prices, especially oil, has been as yet 
incomplete and constitute a significant medium-term risk.
