th
RBI launches the 25 Round of Inflation Expectations Survey of Households 
 
 The Reserve Bank of India has been conducting Inflation Expectations Survey of 
th
Households (IESH) on a quarterly basis since September 2005. The 25 round of the 
Survey with July-September 2011 as the current reference period has been launched 
today. The Survey seeks qualitative responses from households on price changes 
(general prices as well as prices of specific product groups) in the next three months as 
well as in the next one year and quantitative responses on current, three-month ahead 
and one-year ahead inflation rates. The results of this Survey are being used by 
Reserve Bank as one of the important inputs to the monetary policy formulation. 
   
 Inflation expectations are subjective assessments of around 4000 households 
across 12 cities proposed to be covered in the Survey round and are based on 
households’ individual consumption baskets. 
 
The agency M/s Beaumont Consultancy Services, Mumbai has been engaged to 
conduct this round of the Survey on behalf of the Reserve Bank of India. For this 
purpose, the households will be approached by the agency during the quarter. In case 
of any query/clarification, kindly contact at the following address:
