a) Irrespective of the nature of the mandate, central banks will have to assume 
greater responsibility for financial stability.  
b) Crisis prevention frameworks need to be strengthened in every country.  
c) The approach to reforms, going forward, must seek to balance the “growth and 
efficiency gain” goals on the one hand with “growth and equity goals” on the 
other.  
d) Since national policies at times may not be adequate in a globalised world, voice 
of the countries in the region in global governance may have to be collectively 
raised. 
e) Global safety nets and global surveillance would have to be seen as an integral 
part of financial stability initiatives.   
f) Financial sector development requires a cautious approach but without stifling 
innovations, as financial markets remain incomplete in the South Asian 
Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) region.  
These were the key messages of the eighth SAARCFINANCE Governors’ 
Symposium. The main objective of SAARCFINANCE forum is to share experiences on 
macroeconomic policy issues among member countries of the South Asian region. 
Afghanistan, Bangla Desh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka are 
members of this forum.  
The Symposium, hosted by the Reserve Bank of India, was held in Kumarakom, 
Kerala, India on June 10, 2011. Governors of central banks of Afganistan, Bhutan, India, 
Nepal, and Sri Lanka deputy governors of central banks of  Bangladesh and Pakistan 
and Executive Director of Maldives graced the symposium.  
The theme for this year’s Symposium was “Financial Stability Issues”. Given that 
financial stability has acquired the centre stage of public policy debate since the global 
crisis, with animated discussions seeking clarity on the role of central banks, particularly 
monetary policy, the theme was thought to be appropriate. 
The last symposium hosted by the Reserve Bank of India in 2006.  This 
symposium had dealt with the theme of “Communication Policy of Central Banks”.  
In his welcome remarks Dr. Subir Gokarn, Deputy Governor noted how the global 
financial crisis had shaken the faith in some of the pre-crisis persuasive arguments.  He 
highlighted that an increasing number of central banks had started including financial 
stability formally in their policy mandates along with price stability, but the definition of 
financial stability remained largely informal. Recognising the implications for monetary 
policy from the financial stability mandate, he emphasised that the financial stability 
??????????2 
 
mandate and governance arrangements for central banks must be compatible with their 
monetary policy responsibilities. Given their levels of development, he cautioned that 
financial literacy and financial inclusion goals should not get marginalised in SAARC 
countries because of the overdrive for financial stability.  
Three keynote addresses by Reserve Bank Governor Dr. Subbarao, Mr. Jaime 
Caruana, General Manager, Bank for International Settlements and former Governor of 
the Reserve Bank, Dr. Y. V. Reddy provided an opportunity for a comprehensive revisit 
of all  intricate and complex  issues relating to  financial stability.   
In his address, Governor Dr. Subbarao highlighted issues relating to the mandate 
of central banks for financial stability in the international and Indian context. Making a 
strong case for the central banks to play a key role in ensuring financial stability, he 
outlined the challenges in managing the relative prioritisation across multiple objectives. 
He also talked about the difference between a central bank’s role in ensuring financial 
stability in crisis times vis-a-vis that during normal period. The recent trends in 
arrangements for financial stability giving increased responsibility for both systemic 
oversight and prudential regulation to central banks and, institutionalisation of collegial 
arrangements involving the central bank, other regulators and the government, were  
important, he said and added that a similar move in India is reflected in the creation of 
the Financial Stability and Development Council (FSDC). In this context, Dr. Subbarao 
emphasised the ‘D’ in FSDC, which stands for the development dimension of the 
challenge in the financial sector. Irrespective of the type of new institutional 
arrangement, he stressed that coordination mechanisms, especially between the 
government and the regulators, must function in ways that do not compromise the 
autonomy of the regulators.  
The conduct of monetary policy in a world with macro-prudential policies  could 
pose both known and unknown challenges. The presentation from Mr. Caruana was  
analytical in that it  provided possible approaches to the adoption of macro-prudential 
measures, with necessary caution. He noted that stable, resilient and less pro-cyclical 
financial systems improved the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission. But 
macro-prudential policies could alter the nature of interactions between the financial 
system and the real economy, to which monetary policy would have to adapt. He also 
said that macro-prudential policies should not be used to safeguard macroeconomic 
stability, since there was no substitute to monetary and fiscal policies for attaining that 
goal. He cautioned that expectations from macro-prudential policies should not be over 
ambitious, since without a range of reinforcing policies and instruments, the 
effectiveness of prudential measures could be limited. On the scope for conflicts 
between monetary policy and macro-prudential policies, he viewed such concerns as 
overdone. He suggested that multiple objectives could be explicitly ranked, and that the 
timing of  macro-prudential policy reviews could differ from monetary and fiscal policy 
cycles.  
Dr. Y V Reddy in his address emphasised the potential “crisis ahead" as a 
motivation for such debates that were being held in the Symposium. He stated that the 
lessons from “crisis behind us” could be extremely important in shaping the financial 
stability goal. He outlined some key aspects of the pre-crisis stability entrenching 
measures taken in India, including explicit attention given to financial stability as an 
objective in 1997. He referred  to the change from “lazy banking” to “crazy banking” as 
evidenced by significant pick up in credit and money growth, exuberance in real estate 
and consumer credit needs as  the driving motivation behind the use of macro-prudential 
measures in India for preserving financial stability. Dr. Reddy drew attention to an 
important dimension of financial sector reforms, the speed of reforms. He outlined how 
that could be related to domestic vulnerabilities – such as, progress on fiscal 
consolidation and in removing structural rigidities in the real economy. Dr. Reddy posed 
a very pertinent question as to "whether the crisis is behind us or still with us," and 
illustrated with specific examples as to how the drivers of the “crisis behind” remain still 
very much active, including that of the global imbalances. He expressed reservations 3 
 
about the appropriateness of 2019 as the target date for new capital standards. He drew 
attention to the power of large conglomerates in diluting disciplining norms, with the 
potential to move to locations with less aggressive regulatory jurisdictions. 
In the two technical sessions that followed, country presentations were made, 
which brought to the fore the country specific trends in macro-financial conditions and 
plans to entrench financial stability.    
The stimulating panel discussion that followed was anchored  by Shri T.N. Ninan, 
President, Editors’ Guild of India. The panel discussion focussed on some unanswered 
questions thrown by financial stability in the post crisis period. These were:  
• price stability vis-à-vis financial stability,  
• post crisis institutional arrangements for financial stability,  involving various 
authorities,  
• challenge of implementing the international regulatory and supervisory 
reforms, such as, Basel III framework, regulation of Systematically Important 
Financial Institutions and  OTC derivatives markets,  by SAARC countries 
with country-specific adaptations,  
• inadequacy of micro-prudential regulation and supervision in ensuring stability 
at the systemic level and the importance of macro-prudential policies,  
• the link between asset prices and the financial stability.   
In his vote of thanks, Shri Deepak Mohanty, Executive Director, Reserve Bank of 
India outlined some of the major takeaways  from the day’s proceedings. 
(a) Irrespective of the nature of the mandate – i.e., whether explicit or implicit – 
central banks will have to assume greater responsibility for financial stability, 
which in turn may mean multiple – not single - objective approach to conduct 
of monetary policy.  
 
(b) Crisis prevention frameworks need to be strengthened in every country, but 
the approach to be adopted requires debate, consultations and coordination.  
 
(c) Given the level of economic development in the region, the usual suspects 
that could trigger a financial crisis must be avoided. This implies sustained 
emphasis on fiscal consolidation, low inflation, appropriate policies to manage 
volatile capital flows, and a sustainable balance of payments deficit. The 
approach to reforms, going forward, must seek to balance the “growth and 
efficiency gain” goals on the one hand with “growth and equity goals” on the 
other.  
 
(d) Since national policies at times may not be adequate in a globalised world, 
voice of the countries in the region in global governance may have to be 
collectively raised. Global safety nets and global surveillance would have to 
be seen as an integral part of financial stability initiatives.   
 
(e) Financial sector development requires a cautious approach but without stifling 
innovations, as financial markets remain incomplete in the SAARC region.
