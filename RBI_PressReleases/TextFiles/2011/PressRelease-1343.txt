RBI releases Winter 2010 Issue of its Occasional Papers 
The Reserve Bank of India, today released the winter 2010 issue of its Occasional 
Papers. Occasional Papers, a research journal of the Reserve Bank, contains contributions 
of its staff and reflects the views of the authors. This issue is woven around some important 
themes which have been at the forefront of policy discussions. The issue contains articles, 
special notes and a book review. 
Should Monetary Policy in India Respond to Movements in Asset Prices? 
 The paper ‘Should Monetary Policy in India Respond to Movements in Asset Prices?’ 
by Bhupal Singh and Sitikantha Pattanaik examines whether monetary policy should become 
more sensitive to asset price movements and respond proactively to prevent any build up of 
bubbles. The assessment is done in the backdrop of the debate stimulated by the recent 
sub-prime crisis. The empirical analysis in the study indicates that while interest rate 
changes cause movements in stock prices, the reverse causality does not hold. This 
suggests that monetary policy in India does not respond to asset prices, but the asset price 
channel of monetary policy transmission exists. However, shocks to credit conditions 
explain a significant part of asset price variations over medium to long-run, which could be 
part of a broader co-movement of variables over the business cycle, particularly real activity, 
credit flows and asset prices.  
The authors are of the opinion that since higher interest rates seem to cause 
contraction in output, credit demand as well as asset prices, the impact on asset prices alone 
should not be viewed as a good enough reason to use monetary policy for stabilising asset 
price cycles. Further, any policy that aims at limiting the overall pace of credit growth may 
have to be driven by developments, such as, either economic overheating or persistent high 
inflation, but not the perception of an asset price bubble. In their evaluation, asset price 
dynamics could be difficult to decipher for a meaningful use in the conduct of monetary 
policy. The authors are of the view that financial stability concerns from asset price bubbles 
could be better addressed through micro and macro-prudential measures, and the 
effectiveness of such measures could be enhanced when implemented in a sound 
macroeconomic policy environment. 
Exports and Economic Growth: An Examination of ELG Hypothesis for India 
In the paper titled ‘Exports and Economic Growth: An Examination of ELG Hypothesis 
for India’, Dr. Narayan Chandra Pradhan examines the nexus between export growth and 
economic growth and tests the export-led growth (ELG) hypothesis for Indian economy. The 
paper has gone beyond the traditional neo-classical theory of production function by 
estimating an augmented Cobb-Douglas production function covering exports including 
services exports, and has empirically examined both, short and long-run relationships 
between exports and growth. The study finds that about 14 per cent disequilibrium is 
corrected every year in case of ‘goods and services’ and GDP. This empirical finding 
reinforces the nexus between export and GDP growth in both, short and long run. The test of 
Granger causality suggests that the direction of causality runs from export growth to GDP 
growth. On the other hand, there is no reverse causation from GDP growth to export growth. 
The result of Granger causality/Block Exogeneity in VAR framework can be interpreted to 
?????????? 2
say that in the case of Indian economy, movements in the exports appear to lead those of 
GDP. This implies that one can use exports as an additional variable to better predict the 
GDP growth thus substantiating the importance of exports in the growth process of Indian 
economy.  
Special Notes 
Determinants of Private Corporate Sector Investment in India 
Under the Special Notes section, the paper on ‘Determinants of Private Corporate 
Sector Investment in India’ by Ramesh Jangili and Sharad Kumar has explored the 
determinants of corporate investment in a sample of non-Government non-financial public 
limited companies operating in India. The paper spans the period 2000-01 to 2008-09. The 
paper has used the panel regression model for empirically identifying the factors which 
influence corporate investment decisions. Specific factors, such as, firm size, dividend 
payouts, leverage, cost of funds, production as well as cash flows along with the macro-
economic variables like real effective exchange rate, inflation, non-food credit growth and 
capital market developments are considered as endogenous variables in the model. The 
results show that firm size, cash flow ratio and growth in value of production are positively 
associated, whereas, dividend payout ratio and effective cost of borrowing are negatively 
associated and are statistically significant to investment of the firm. The authors also find that 
real effective exchange rate and inflation at the macro level are negatively related with the 
corporate investment and non-food credit growth and capital market developments are 
positively related.  
Inclusive Growth and its Regional Dimension 
The study, ‘Inclusive Growth and its Regional Dimension’ by P. K. Nayak, Sadhan 
Kumar Chattopadhyay, Arun Vishnu Kumar and V. Dhanya analyses the inter-linkages 
between different development indicators and various regions and sections to understand 
the nuances of India’s growth process. The authors examine the causal relationship 
between bank finance and economic growth in a time-series framework with co-integration 
and error correction model. The study finds that bank finance plays a major role in the 
growth process with bi-directional causality between GDP growth and financial 
development. The impulse response function analysis indicated that the impact of credit on 
GDP is stronger than the reverse. In conclusion the authors emphasise the role of financial 
institutions in the overall scheme of inclusive growth. The study concludes that furtherance 
of macroeconomic reforms, harnessing synergistic links among the sectors, opportunities 
provided by the forces of globalisation and intensive use of technology could lead to 
achieving higher level of inclusive growth.  
Book Review 
P.S. Rawat reviews the book titled ‘Asia and the Global Economic Crisis: 
Challenges in a Financially Integrated World’ by John Malcolm Dowling and Pradumna 
Bickram Rana, Palgrave-Macmillan, 2010.  
The book, with twelve chapters, elaborately covers the origin of global economic 
crisis and deals with the responses of the US and Europe and quickly moves on to 
focussing on its spread to Asia, especially Asia’s reaction/policy responses to it.  The book 
analyses the impact of the policy responses and the persisting challenges in rebalancing 
the global economy, the next steps in regional economic integration in Asia, and issues 
related to reform of the international financial architecture. As the world is emerging from 
the crisis, the book assesses what has been achieved so far, where Asia stands at the 
beginning of the new decade and what more needs to be done to successfully manage 
financial globalisation in the future.
