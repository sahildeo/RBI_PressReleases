Foreign Exchange for You:  
RBI reaches out to Kolkata Public through Exhibition 
 
 
Central banks closely look at foreign exchange flows not only to maintain 
financial stability but also to ensure hassle-free foreign exchange transactions for 
trade and individuals. This was the message given by Smt. Shyamala Gopinath, 
Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India, today in Kolkata. She was inaugurating 
‘Foreign Exchange For You’ – a two-day outreach programme of the Reserve Bank 
of India on Foreign Exchange being held at the National Library, Kolkata. The foreign 
exchange regulations have been simplified a great deal over the last several years. 
There is, however, still an apprehension in the public mind about availability of 
foreign exchange. The objective of the exhibition is to demystify the subject of 
foreign exchange and to assure the public that foreign exchange is available to them 
for all genuine purposes. 
 
The exhibition is open to public between 10.00 a.m. to 6.00 p.m. at the 
National Library on April 18 and 19, 2011. A few public and private sector banks as 
well as full-fledged money changers have put their stalls exhibiting foreign exchange 
facilities available to members of public. A special desk to answer public queries on 
fictitious offers of foreign exchange is also set up by the Reserve Bank. 
 
Exporters, importers, trade bodies, bankers participated in the interface with 
the Reserve Bank Deputy Governor, Smt. Gopinath held in the morning today. 
Students from a few colleges also visited the exhibition and participated in the 
interface and got clarifications on questions relating to foreign exchange directly from 
Senior Officials of the Reserve Bank and the banks. The students particularly 
enjoyed taking the quiz and playing the games based on foreign exchange 
information gathered through the exhibits displayed at the exhibition. 
 
The Reserve Bank has been conducting such outreach programmes in 
various parts of the country. The outreach programme includes an exhibition of 
foreign exchange facilities made available to trade and individuals over the past 
several years. Interface with the Top Executives of the Reserve Bank of India is a 
highlight of such outreach programmes.
