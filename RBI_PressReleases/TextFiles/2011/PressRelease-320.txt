Reserve Bank Cancels the Licence of Solapur Nagari  
Audyogik Sahakari Bank Niyamit, Solapur (Maharashtra) 
In view of the fact that Solapur Nagari Audyogik Sahakari Bank Niyamit, 
Solapur (Maharashtra), had ceased to be solvent, all efforts to revive it in close 
consultation with the Government of Maharashtra had failed and the depositors were 
being inconvenienced by continued uncertainty, the Reserve Bank of India delivered 
the order cancelling its licence to the bank as on the close of business on November 
5, 2011. The Registrar of Co-operative Societies, Maharashtra has also been 
requested to issue an order for winding up the bank and appoint a liquidator for the 
bank.  It may be highlighted that on liquidation, every depositor is entitled to 
repayment of his/her deposits up to a monetary ceiling of ` 1,00,000/- (Rupees One 
lakh only) from the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) 
under usual terms and conditions.  
 The bank was granted a licence by Reserve Bank on October 19, 1979 to 
commence banking business. The statutory inspection of the bank under Section 35 
of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (As Applicable to Co-operative Societies) [the 
Act], with reference to its financial position as on March 31, 2005 revealed that the 
assessed networth of the bank was negative and the bank’s deposits had eroded to 
the extent of 3.0%. The financial parameters of the bank continued to deteriorate 
further as revealed during subsequent inspections conducted with reference to its 
financial position as on March 31, 2006, March 31, 2007, March 31, 2008, March 31, 
2009 and March 31, 2010. The bank was issued supervisory instructions on June 27, 
2006 based on its deteriorating financial position as on March 31, 2005 and these 
supervisory instructions were modified, from time to time, based on the findings of 
the relevant inspection reports.    
As the bank had violated operational instructions issued vide letter dated June 
27, 2006 and not complied with Reserve Bank of India guidelines contained in 
circular dated December 17, 2009, regarding maintenance of investments in 
government securities, a monetary penalty amounting to ` 5.00 lakh was levied on 
the bank after issue of Show Cause Notice in this regard.  
   The bank was unable to manage its liquidity and due to run on its deposits 
and liquidity crisis, the bank was placed under all inclusive directions under Section 
35 A of the Act, vide directive UBD.CO.BSD 1/D -28/12.22.278/2010-11 dated 
January 6, 2011, with effect from the close of business as on January 7, 2011, for a 
period of six months. The directive was modified vide order UBD.CO.BSD 1/D-
45/12.22.278/2010-11 dated June 21, 2011, extending the period of directions for a 
further period of six months.

 The statutory inspection of the bank under Section 35 of the Act, with 
reference to the financial position of the bank as on March 31, 2011 revealed further 
deterioration in its financial position and other violations. Its net worth was assessed 
at (-) ` 1979.04 lakh and CRAR was assessed at (-)49.4% The erosion in deposits 
was to the extent of 30.1%. The gross and net NPAs formed 33.4% and 22.3% of the 
gross and net advances respectively. The assessed net loss of the bank stood at 
`1380.38 lakh for the year ended March 31, 2011 against the reported net loss of 
`1177.71 lakh by the bank.  
           Serious deficiencies as mentioned above revealed that the affairs of the bank 
were being conducted in a manner detrimental to the interests of the depositors. The 
bank did not comply with the provisions of sections 11(1), 18, 22(3)(a), 22(3)(b) and 
24 of the Act. Pursuant to the aforesaid serious deficiencies/irregularities and the 
deteriorating financial position of the bank, it was issued a notice vide letter dated 
August 12, 2011 to show cause (SCN) as to why the licence granted to the bank on 
October 19, 1979 to conduct banking business should not be cancelled. The bank 
submitted its reply to the SCN vide its letter dated September 6, 2011. The reply to 
the SCN was considered and examined but not found satisfactory.  Further, no 
concrete proposal was received from the bank for merger or any viable revival / 
restructuring plan. 
 Therefore, Reserve Bank  of India took the extreme measure of cancelling 
licence of the bank in the interest of bank's depositors. With the cancellation of 
licence and commencement of liquidation proceedings, the process of paying the 
depositors of the Solapur Nagari Audyogik Sahakari Bank Niyamit, Solapur 
(Maharashtra), the amount insured as per the DICGC Act, will be set in motion 
subject to the terms and conditions of the Deposit Insurance Scheme. 
        Consequent to the cancellation of its licence, Solapur Nagari Audyogik Sahakari 
Bank Niyamit, Solapur (Maharashtra) is prohibited from carrying on ‘banking
