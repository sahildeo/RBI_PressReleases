RBI introduces Working Paper Series 
The Reserve Bank of India today released two Working Papers on its website. 
These are:  
Working Paper 1: An Empirical Analysis of the Relationship between Currency Futures 
and Exchange Rates Volatility in India by Somnath Sharma; and  
Working Paper 2: The Implications of Renminbi Revaluation on India’s Trade – A Study 
by S. Arunachalaramanan and Ramesh Golait  
The Reserve Bank of India has decided to introduce a ‘RBI Working Paper 
Series’ (RBI - WP) to provide a platform to the Reserve Bank Staff for presenting their 
research studies as well as to receive feedback from informed researchers.   
One of the hallmarks of research in central banks is to sense the relevant 
developments and emerging challenges and provide quality research inputs for policy 
making. To be able to do this, the research studies should be on subjects linked with 
the goals and objectives of the central bank and should be conducted in a scientific 
way. With proactive and strategic role of the central bank staff, the research inputs 
could serve as necessary tools for scientific policy-making and efficient functioning of 
the central bank. The initiative to publish the Working Papers comes in the wake of 
encouraging the Reserve Bank staff to contribute towards such efforts. 
The Reserve Bank has another research publication called the ‘Occasional 
Papers’. Research published in ‘Occasional Papers’ is work produced by the Staff of 
the Reserve Bank on a broad range of issues. Papers published under ‘Working 
Papers’ Series are quick analytical research papers on issues and challenges of 
contemporary relevance to the Reserve Bank. Unlike Occasional Papers, which are 
published with specific periodicity, RBI - WP Series will be published, as and when 
ready and in digitised form only. 
 ‘DRG Studies’ is also another attempt to carry out an in-depth study on 
contemporaneous subjects. These are prepared under the auspices of Development 
Research Group (DRG) involving an outside expert leading an internal researchers’ 
team. 
The views expressed in all the research publications of the Reserve Bank, 
including the RBI Working Papers Series, do not necessarily reflect the views of the 
Reserve Bank and as such should not be reported as representing the views of the 
Reserve Bank of India.  
Feedback, if any, on the papers could be addressed to the respective authors of 
the RBI Working Paper Series.
