Monthly Bulletin - February 2011 
 The February issue of the Bulletin carries the special article:  Developments in 
India's BoP during Second Quarter of 2010-11: Trade, Invisibles and Capital 
Account.   
Highlights: 
1. Developments in India's BoP during Second Quarter of 2010-11: Trade, 
Invisibles and Capital Account.  
  The article provides details on developments in India's balance of payments 
during July-September 2010 along with the partially revised data for April-June 2010 
and revised data for 2008-09 and 2009-10. As per the recommendation of the 
Working Group on Balance of Payments Manual for India (Chairman: Deepak 
Mohanty), the disaggregated data on services for the first two quarters of 2010-11 
have also been published as part of this article. 
Main Findings 
• The trade deficit widened to US$ 35.4 billion during July-September 2010, 
despite higher growth in exports relative to imports.  
• The higher growth in invisibles payments led by travel, transportation, 
business and financial services coupled with lower growth in invisibles receipts 
due to moderation in receipts under income and private transfers resulted in a 
lower net invisibles surplus of US$ 19.6 billion during July-September 2010 as 
compared with the corresponding period of last year.  
• The higher trade deficit combined with the lower invisibles surplus resulted in 
the widening of current account deficit to US$ 15.8 billion during the second 
quarter of 2010-11.  
• The capital account surplus increased over the corresponding quarter of last 
year, mainly due to portfolio investments, short-term credit and external 
commercial borrowings.  
• With capital account surplus being higher than the current account deficit, the 
overall balance was in surplus at US$ 3.3 billion resulting in a net accretion to 
foreign exchange reserves of equivalent amount during July-September 2010.
