ECB Policy modified: All-in-cost Ceiling enhanced;  
ECB raised for Rupee Outlay to be brought in Immediately 
On a review of the developments in the global financial markets and current 
macro-economic conditions, it has been decided, in consultation with the 
Government of India, to modify certain aspects of the External Commercial 
Borrowings (ECB) policy as under: 
(i) Enhancement in all-in-cost ceiling 
The all-in-cost for ECBs has been revised as under: 
All-in-cost over 6 month LIBOR* 
Average Maturity Period 
Existing Revised 
Three and up to five years 300 bps 350 bps 
More than five years 500 bps 500 bps 
               * for the respective currency of credit or applicable benchmark 
(ii) Parking of ECB Proceeds 
The proceeds of the ECB raised abroad for Rupee expenditure in India, such 
as, local sourcing of capital goods, on-lending to Self-Help Groups or for micro 
credit, payment for spectrum allocation, etc., should be brought immediately for 
credit to Rupee accounts with AD Category I banks in India. In other words, ECB 
proceeds meant only for foreign currency expenditure can be retained abroad 
pending utilisation. As hitherto, however, the Rupee funds will not be permitted to be 
used for investment in capital markets, real estate or for inter-corporate lending.  
These amendments in ECB policy will come into force immediately and the 
enhancement in all-in-cost ceiling is applicable up to March 31, 2012 subject to 
review thereafter.  
Detailed instructions have been issued vide A. P. (DIR Series) Circular Nos . 
51 and 52 dated November 23, 2011.
