RBI places the proposed guidelines on authorisation of 
Primary Dealers (PDs) in India for public comments 
 
The Reserve Bank of India has, today, placed on its website, the ‘Proposed 
guidelines on authorisation of Primary Dealers in India’ (Annex) for public comments. 
The objective of the proposed review of existing guidelines is to make the PD 
authorisation policy more transparent and ensure that the new PDs have sound 
capital, adequate experience/expertise in the Government Securities market and 
prudent risk management measures to enable them to meet their roles and 
obligations in the Government debt market in an effective manner. 
  
Comments on the revised guidelines may be forwarded to the Chief General 
Manager, Internal Debt Management Department, Reserve Bank of India, Central 
Office Building, 23rd floor, S.B. Road, Fort, Mumbai - 400001 or emailed latest by
