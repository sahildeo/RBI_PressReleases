Mid Quarter Monetary Policy Review: December 2011 
Monetary Measures 
On the basis of the current macroeconomic assessment, it has been decided 
to: 
• keep the cash reserve ratio (CRR) unchanged at 6 per cent; and  
• keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) 
unchanged at 8.5 per cent.  
Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF will remain unchanged at 
7.5 per cent and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate at 9.5 per cent.  
Introduction 
Since the Reserve Bank ’s Second Quarter Review (SQR) of October 25, 
2011, the global economic outlook has worsened significantly. The recent European 
Union (EU) summit agreement did not assuage negative market sentiments, thereby 
increasing the likelihood of persistent financial turbulence as well as a recession in 
Europe. Both factors pose threats to emerging market economies (EMEs), including 
India. Significantly, despite these developments, crude oil prices remain elevated.  
On the domestic front, growth is clearly decelerating. This reflects the 
combined impact of several factors: the uncertain global environment, the cumulative 
impact of past monetary policy tightening and domestic policy uncertainties.  
Both inflation and inflation expectations are currently above the comfort level 
of the Reserve Bank. However, reassuringly, inflationary pressures are expected to 
abate in the coming months despite high crude oil prices and rupee depreciation. 
The growth deceleration is contributing to a decline in inflation momentum, which is 
also being helped by softening food inflation. 
Global Economy 
The global economic situation continues to be fragile with no credible solution 
as yet to the immediate  euro area sovereign debt problem. At the EU summit on 
December 8-9, the European leaders agreed on a new fiscal compact, involving 
stronger coordination of economic policies to strengthen fiscal discipline. While the 
agreement is necessary for medium and long-term sustainability of the euro area, its 
ability to resolve short-term funding pressures was questioned by markets.  Q3 euro 
area growth, at 0.8 per cent, was anaemic and 2012 growth is now expected to be 
weaker than earlier projected.  Reflecting these projections, the European Central 
Bank (ECB) cut its policy rate twice in the last two months, and also implemented 
some non-standard measures. By contrast, growth in the US in Q3 of 2011 was 
better than in Q2, although still substantially below trend.

Growth in EMEs is also moderating on account of sluggish growth in 
advanced economies and the impact of monetary tightening to contain inflation. In 
view of the slowing down of their economies, Brazil, Indonesia, Israel and Thailand 
cut their policy rates, while China cut its reserve requirements. EME currencies have 
also come under varying degrees of downward pressure as a result of global risk 
aversion and financial stress emanating from the euro area.  
Domestic economy 
Growth 
GDP growth moderated to 6.9 per cent in Q2 of 2011-12 from 7.7 per cent in 
Q1 and 8.8 per cent in the corresponding quarter a year ago. The deceleration in 
economic activity in Q2 was mainly on account of a sharp moderation in industrial 
growth. On the expenditure side, investment showed a significant  slowdown. 
Overall, during the first half (April-September) of 2011-12, GDP growth slowed down 
to 7.3 per cent from 8.6 per cent last year.  
Industrial performance has further deteriorated as reflected in the decline of 
the index of industrial production (IIP) by 5.1 per cent, y-o-y, in October 2011. This 
was mainly due to contraction in manufacturing and mining activities. The contraction 
was particularly sharp in capital goods with a y-o-y decline of 25.5 per cent, 
reinforcing the investment decline story emerging from the GDP numbers. 
Other indicators also suggest a similar tendency, though by no means as 
dramatic as the IIP. The HSBC purchasing managers' index (PMI) for manufacturing 
suggested further moderation in growth in November 2011. However, PMI-services 
index recovered in November from contractionary levels in the preceding two 
months. Corporate margins in Q2 of 2011-12 moderated significantly as compared 
with their levels in Q1. The decline in margins was largely on account of higher input 
and interest costs. Pricing power is evidently declining. 
On the food front, the progress of sowing under major rabi crops so far has 
been satisfactory, with area sown under foodgrains and pulses so far being broadly 
comparable with that of last year.  
Inflation 
On a y-o-y basis, headline WPI inflation moderated to 9.1 per cent in 
November from 9.7 per cent in October, driven largely by decline in  primary food 
articles inflation. Fuel group inflation went up marginally. Notably, non-food 
manufactured products inflation remains elevated, actually increasing to 7.9 per cent 
in November from 7.6 per cent in October, reflecting rising input costs. The new 
combined (rural and urban) consumer price index (base: 2010=100) rose further to 
114.2 in October from 113.1 in September. Inflation in terms of other consumer price 
indices was in the range of 9.4 to 9.7 per cent in October 2011. Reassuringly, 
headline momentum indicators, such as the seasonally adjusted month-on-month 
and 3-month moving average rolling quarterly inflation rate, show continuing signs of 
moderation.  
External sector  
Merchandise exports growth decelerated sharply to an average of 13.6 per 
cent y-o-y in October-November from an average of 40.6 per cent in the first half of 
2011-12.  However, as imports moderated less than exports, the trade deficit 
widened, putting pressure on the current account. This, combined with rebalancing 
of global portfolios by foreign institutional investors and the tendency of exporters to 
defer repatriating their export earnings, has led to significant pressure on the rupee.  
As on December 15, 2011, the rupee had depreciated by about 17 per cent 
against the US dollar over its level on August 5, 2011, the day on which the US debt 3 
 
downgrade happened. In the face of this, several measures were taken to attract 
inflows. Limits on investment in government and corporate debt instruments by 
foreign investors were increased. The ceilings on interest rates payable on 
non ?resident deposits were raised. The all ?in ?cost ceiling for external commercial 
borrowings was increased. Further, a series of administrative measures that 
discourage speculative behaviour were also initiated. The Reserve Bank is closely 
monitoring the developments in the external sector and it will respond to the evolving 
situation as appropriate. 
Fiscal  Situation 
The central government ’s key deficit indicators worsened during 2011-12 
(April-October), primarily on account of a decline in revenue receipts and increase in 
expenditure, particularly subsidies. The fiscal deficit at 74.4 per cent of the budgeted 
estimate in the first seven months of 2011-12 was significantly higher than 42.6 per 
cent in the corresponding period last year (about 61.2 per cent if adjusted for more 
than budgeted spectrum proceeds received last year). The likely slippage in this 
year ’s fiscal deficit has inflationary implications.                                 
Money, Credit and Liquidity Conditions  
The y-o-y money supply (M ) growth moderated from 17.2 per cent at the 
3
beginning of the financial year to 16.3 per cent on December 2, 2011, although still 
higher than the projected trajectory of 15.5 per cent for the year. Y-o-y non-food 
credit growth at 17.5 per cent on December 02, 2011, however, was below the 
indicative projection of 18 per cent.  
Consistent with the stance of monetary policy, liquidity conditions have 
remained in deficit during this fiscal year. However, the deficit increased significantly 
beginning the second week of November 2011. The average borrowings under the 
daily LAF increased to around ` 89,000 crore during November-December (up to 
December 15, 2011) from around  `49,000 crore during April-October 2011.  The 
Reserve Bank conducted open market operations (OMOs) on three occasions in 
November-December 2011 for an amount aggregating about ` 24,000 crore to ease 
liquidity conditions. 
There are currently no significant signs of stress in the money market. The 
overnight call money rate is stable around the policy repo rate and liquidity facilities 
such as marginal standing facility (MSF) remain unutilised.  However, in view of the 
fact  that borrowings from the LAF are persistently above the Reserve Bank's 
comfort zone, further OMOs will be conducted as and when seen to be appropriate.   
Outlook 
Global growth for 2011 and 2012 is now expected to be lower than earlier 
anticipated. Increased strains in financial markets on the back of growing concerns 
over euro area sovereign debt, limited monetary and fiscal policy manoeuvrability, 
high unemployment rates, weak housing markets and elevated oil prices are all 
contributory factors. These factors have also contributed to moderating growth in the 
EMEs. As a consequence of all-round slower growth, inflation has also started 
declining, both in advanced countries and EMEs.   
On the domestic front, agricultural prospects look promising on the back of 
expected record kharif output and satisfactory progress on rabi sowing. However, 
industrial activity is moderating, driven by deceleration in investment, which is a 
matter of serious concern. Overall, the growth momentum in the economy is clearly 
moderating. Further, considering the global and domestic macroeconomic situation, 
the downside risks to the Reserve Bank ’s growth projection, as set out in the SQR, 4 
 
have increased significantly.   
Between the First Quarter Review (FQR) and the SQR, while non-oil 
commodity prices had declined significantly, the rupee too had depreciated sharply. 
Consequently, the headline inflation projection at 7 per cent for March 2012, as set 
out in the FQR, was retained in the SQR. With moderation in food inflation in 
November 2011 and expected moderation in aggregate demand and hence in non-
food manufactured products inflation, the inflation projection for March 2012 is 
retained at 7 per cent. 
The Reserve Bank will make a formal numerical assessment of its growth and 
inflation projections for 2011-12 in the third quarter review of January 2012. 
Guidance 
While inflation remains on its projected trajectory, downside risks to growth 
have clearly increased. The guidance given in the SQR was that, based on the 
projected inflation trajectory, further rate hikes might not be warranted. In view of the 
moderating growth momentum and higher downside risks to growth, this guidance is 
being reiterated. From this point on, monetary policy actions are likely to reverse the 
cycle, responding to the risks to growth. 
However, it must be emphasised that inflation risks remain high and inflation 
could quickly recur as a result of both supply and demand forces. Also, the rupee 
remains under stress. The timing and magnitude of further actions will depend on a 
continuing assessment of how these factors shape up in the months ahead.
