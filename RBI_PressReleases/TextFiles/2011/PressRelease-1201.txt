RBI releases Report on Securing Card Present Transaction for  
Public Comments 
The Reserve Bank of India today placed on its website the Report of the 
Working Group on Securing Card Present Transaction. Comments of the Report 
may please be emailed or forwarded by June 30, 2011 to the Chief General 
Manager, Department of Payment and Settlement System, Reserve Bank of India, 
Central Office, Mumbai-400001.  
Card Present Transactions (at PoS and ATMs) constitute major proportion of 
card based transactions in the country. Currently, transactions using cards at PoS 
do not require additional authentication in majority of cards. Further most of the 
cards used in India, presently used magnetic stripe technology. Taking into account 
vulnerabilities involved, and to increase customer confidence may countries led by 
European Union have moved to Chip and Pin technology.  
The Reserve Bank of India constituted a Working Group consisting of banks 
and card companies in March 2011 to look into all the related issues implementing 
the security of card transactions in India and suggesting a road map for migration. 
The Working Group submitted its report on June 2, 2011.
