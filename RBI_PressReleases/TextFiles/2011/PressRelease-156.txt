RBI Working Paper Series No. 20 for November 2011 
 
The Reserve Bank of India today placed Working Paper titled "Credit Channel 
of Monetary Transmission in India - How Effective and Long is the Lag?" by Jeevan 
Kumar Khundrakpam. The effectiveness of a monetary policy in the achievement of 
its objectives of growth with price stability depends on how the policy signals are 
transmitted through the financial system and the economy. When interest rate is the 
main instrument of signaling policy stance, transmission through the commercial 
interest rate is one of the main channels. In this channel, change in policy interest 
rate, by affecting the deposits and lending rates of financial institutions, alters the 
spending and investment decisions of households and businesses, and 
consequently, inflation and growth.  
 
With the adoption of Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) framework as the 
operating procedure, interest rate has become the main signaling instrument of 
monetary policy in India. Thus, this paper examines the credit channel of monetary 
policy transmission through change in policy interest rate during the post-LAF period 
of 2001:3 to 2011:3. Drawing on the literature, two reduced form equations, one 
representing nominal bank credit and the other real bank credit, are estimated. The 
estimates are carried out after transforming the variables to stationary form and 
following an approach similar to Hendry’s general-to-specific method. Stability, 
structural break and various diagnostic tests, besides the estimations of rolling 
regressions, are performed to confirmed robustness of the results. 
 
The paper finds that, besides the positive influence of economic activity on 
bank credit, policy induced expansion or contraction in deposit or money supply 
makes banks to adjust their credit portfolio correspondingly. Importantly, the credit 
channel of monetary transmission is found to be significant and robust. Specifically, 
the transmission of policy rate to nominal or real bank credit growth takes about 
seven months. This transmission lags was found to be robust across all sub-sample 
periods considered. Over the full sample period, 100 basis points increase in policy 
rate, ceteris paribus, led to decline in the annualised growth in nominal and real bank 
credit by 2.78 and 2.17 percentage points, respectively.  However, according to the 
author, the impact of policy interest rate on bank credit declined after the global 
financial crisis.
