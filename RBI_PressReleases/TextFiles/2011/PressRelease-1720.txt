RBI launches 23 Round of Inflation Expectations Survey of Households 
rd
The Reserve Bank of India has today launched the 23 round of Inflation 
Expectations Survey of Households. January-March 2011 is the reference period for 
the current survey. M/s Beaumont Consultancy Services, Mumbai has been engaged 
to conduct this Round of the Survey on behalf of the Reserve Bank of India. 
 The Reserve Bank has been conducting Inflation Expectations Survey of 
Households (IESH) on a quarterly basis since September 2005. The Survey seeks 
qualitative responses from households on price changes (general price levels as well 
as prices of specific product groups) in the next three months as well as in the next 
one year and quantitative responses on current, three-month ahead and one-year 
ahead inflation rates. The Reserve Bank uses the results of this Survey as an 
important input to monetary policy formulation.   
 Inflation expectations are subjective assessments of around 4000 households 
from across 12 cities and are based on households’ individual consumption baskets.  
The agency engaged by the Reserve Bank will, for the purpose of the survey, 
approach the households during the quarter. In case of any query/clarification, kindly  
contact:
