Fabricated Certificate of Registration - M/s Forex Achievements 
It has come to the notice of Reserve Bank of India that some entity, which 
may be a foreign one, is operating in India and doing NBFI business, including 
acceptance of deposits, without obtaining a certificate of Registration (CoR) from 
RBI. The company is misusing the name of RBI by displaying a fake CoR on its web 
site for collecting deposits from the public.  
The Bank would like to clarify to the general public that no company / entity by 
the name, M/s Forex Achievements is registered as a company under the 
Companies Act, 1956 which is a prerequisite for obtaining CoR from the Bank. The 
CoR bearing Registration No. 07.00410 dated April 07, 2010 displayed by the entity 
on its web site is a fabricated one and not issued by RBI to it. Members of public are 
hereby cautioned not to deposit money with M/s Forex Achievements and such other 
unincorporated bodies. Persons depositing money with these unincorporated bodies 
would be doing so at their own risk. 
Under Section 45 – S (1) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, 
unincorporated bodies that are carrying on the business of a financial institution or 
whose principal business is that of receiving deposits are prohibited from accepting 
deposits from the public and the State Governments are empowered to take action 
against such entities under Section 45T (1) of the RBI Act 1934.  Money circulation 
schemes are also banned under the Prize Chit and Money Circulation (Banning) Act 
1978 and are governed by the respective State Governments.  Hence all complaints 
on unauthorised acceptance of deposits and running of money circulation schemes, 
when received by the Reserve Bank are immediately referred to the Economic 
Offences Wing of the concerned State Governments.   
  The public is hereby warned to be cautious in making investments with such 
entities.  Before making investments, they are advised in their own interest to visit 
the website of the Reserve Bank of India to check whether the companies they are 
placing deposits with are registered with the Reserve Bank and entitled to hold 
deposits.  The names of such companies are available on RBI’s web site at 
www.rbi.org.in-->sitemap-->NBFC List.
