RBI defers Implementation of Compensation Guidelines 
The Reserve Bank of India has deferred the implementation of the guidelines 
on compensation for whole time directors/chief executive officers/risk takers and 
control function staff of private sector banks and foreign banks operating in India to 
2012-13. This was done to give banks sufficient time to formulate their policies. The 
guidelines were slated for implementation for 2011-2012. The Reserve Bank has 
advised banks to refer, in the meantime, to the Basel Committee on Banking 
Supervision (BCBS) consultative document on Methodologies for Risk and 
Performance Alignment of Remuneration and start preparatory work. The document 
was issued in October 2010. The Reserve Bank has also stated that it would issue 
the final guidelines on compensation after the publication of the final paper by the 
BCBS. 
It may be recalled that the Reserve Bank had, in July 2010, placed on its 
website draft guidelines on compensation for whole time directors/chief executive 
officers/risk takers and control function staff of private sector banks and foreign 
banks operating in India. A large number of comments/suggestions have been 
received on draft guidelines. These are being examined. Meanwhile, the Basel 
Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), in October 2010, brought out a 
consultative paper titled ‘Range of Methodologies for Risk and Performance 
Alignment of Remuneration’ for public comments.
