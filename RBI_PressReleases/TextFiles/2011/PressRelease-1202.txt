 ‘Challenges to Central Banking in the Context of Financial Crisis’ 
RBI releases Volume for the First International Research Conference  
 
The Reserve Bank of India today released the Volume for the First 
International Research Conference (FIRC) on ‘Challenges to Central Banking in the 
Context of Financial Crisis’. The Volume, edited by Dr. Subir Gokarn, Deputy 
Governor, brings together the papers and proceedings of the FIRC and gives a 
flavour of the issues and discussions on them. The key messages from the 
Conference are: 
 
• National policies alone cannot prevent a crisis even if these are the most 
appropriate unless some of the global challenges are addressed collectively 
at the global level. The international monetary system has been found 
inadequate to tackle global imbalances, which had to manifest in the form of 
crisis or the other at some stage. 
 
• The significance of the unprecedented and co-ordinated action led by G20 in 
avoiding another Great Depression needs to be recognised. In view of the 
difficult years expected, we must sustain the global approach despite 
domestic differences in policies. 
 
• Self-regulation and vigilance by creditors do not represent effective 
substitutes for regulation and it has to be the responsibility of the public policy 
to provide regulatory systems. The need has arisen for both a new approach 
to regulatory oversight that includes macro-prudential regulations and a major 
reworking of the mandate of monetary policy to include financial stability. 
 
• Flexible inflation targetting is important in the context of apprehensions 
expressed in some quarters about inflation-focussed monetary policy 
involving the possible neglect of asset price bubbles and the financial stability 
objective. 
 
• Lender-of-last-resort facility and financial regulations were generally seen as 
necessary prudential instruments to safeguard financial stability, though they 
were not deemed to be sufficient. 
 
• Fiscal problems of the industrial countries could be much larger than the 
official debt figures seemed to suggest.  
 
The discussions and analyses in the Conference Volume are relevant for the 
events currently playing out in the global financial arena and would need to be 
heeded by all policymakers – present and future.
