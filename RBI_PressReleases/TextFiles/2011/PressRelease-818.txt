RBI Central Board meets Today at Mumbai;  
Governor meets State Government and Bankers  
The Central Board of Directors of the Reserve Bank of India met today at 
Mumbai. Dr. D. Subbarao, Governor, Reserve Bank of India chaired the meeting. 
Shri Y. H. Malegam, Prof U. R. Rao, Shri Lakshmi Chand, Shri H. P. Ranina,        
Shri Suresh Neotia, Dr. A. Vaidyanathan, Prof. M. M. Sharma and                      
Shri Sanjay Labroo were present at the meeting. Deputy Governors of the Reserve 
Bank, Dr. K.C. Chakrabarty, Dr. Subir Gokarn, Shri Anand Sinha and Shri H R Khan 
were also present. The meeting was also attended by Shri R. Gopalan, Secretary, 
Economic Affairs and Government nominee director on the Central Board and        
Dr. Kaushik Basu, Chief Economic Adviser. The meeting reviewed key economic, 
monetary and financial developments in the country.  
The Central Board meets at least once every quarter. Apart from holding 
meetings in Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata and one in New Delhi after the Union Budget 
which is addressed by the Finance Minister - the rest of the meetings are held in 
other state capitals by rotation. The main function of the Central Board of Directors of 
the Reserve Bank is to provide overall direction to the Reserve Bank’s affairs.  
Prior to the Board meeting, the Governor also met, on August 10, 2011, the 
officials of the Maharashtra State Government and bankers at a specially convened 
meeting of the State Level Bankers Committee (SLBC). Issues, such as, crop loans, 
crop insurance, financial inclusion, cooperative banks and credit-deposit ratio in the 
State of Maharashtra were discussed. The following decisions were taken:  
• The performance of commercial banks in disbursement of crop loans in 
Maharashtra was better than that in the previous years. However, commercial 
banks would strive to further improve the achievement of the increased target 
of crop loans this year.  
• Banks and State government would work together to establish linkages so as 
to directly credit Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act 
(MGNREGA) benefits to beneficiaries’ bank accounts. For this purpose, all the 
lead banks would cover one block each in the next one month, review the 
performance there and scale up to cover the entire State.  
• Banks would also open 25 per cent of their branches in villages with 
population of less than 10,000. 
• Senior bank and government officials, such as, Regional Managers and 
District Collectors would periodically visit the bank branches in sensitive/ 
disturbed districts in the State to understand first-hand, issues and problems 
faced by the branch level functionaries and ensure availability of banking 
services in these areas.
