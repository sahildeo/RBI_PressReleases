Developments in India's Balance of Payments during the 
First Quarter (April-June) of 2011-12  
  Preliminary data on India’s balance of payments (BoP) for the first quarter (Q1), 
i.e., April-June 2011 of the financial year 2011-12, are now available. The details of 
these data, as per the revised format of BoP presentation provided in IMF's BPM6, are 
set out in Statement I. These data as per the old format are also given in Statement II. 
The correspondence between old and new format is provided in Annex 1. 
Major Highlights of BoP during April-June 2011  
 During Q1 of 2011-12, a rise in trade deficit, despite sharper increase in exports 
than imports and increase in net export of services, led to widening of current account 
deficit (CAD) as compared with Q1 of the previous year. 
• On a BoP basis, goods exports recorded a growth of 47.1 per cent while imports 
registered a growth of 33.2 per cent during Q1 of 2011-12. 
• The trade deficit on BoP basis, in absolute terms, amounted to US$ 35.4 billion, 
which was higher than the corresponding quarter of the previous year (US$ 32.3 
billion).  
• Net exports of services recorded a growth of 19.1 per cent during Q1 of 2011-12 
over Q1 of 2010-11 mainly due to higher growth in receipts led by ‘transportation’, 
‘telecommunication, computer and information services’ and ‘other business 
services’.  
• While net secondary income (private transfers) receipts remained buoyant at US$ 
13.7 billion, primary income account (investment income) continued to show a net 
outflow. 
• Consequently, the CAD at US$ 14.1 billion was higher in Q1 of 2011-12 than the 
corresponding quarter of the previous year.  
• Financial account witnessed a surge primarily on account of foreign direct 
investment  and other investment led by loans.  
• There was a net accretion to foreign exchange reserves of US$ 5.4 billion during 
Q1 of 2011-12 (excluding valuation). 
Balance of Payments for April-June 2011 (Q1) of 2011-12 
The major items of the BoP for the first quarter (Q1) of 2011-12 are set out below in 
Table 1.

• Growth in goods exports was higher during Q1 of 2011-12 as compared with Q1

?????????? 2
• On a BoP basis, India’s goods exports, recorded a growth of 47.1 per cent during 
Q1 of 2011-12 as compared with 40.4 per cent recorded during Q1 of previous 
year. Similarly, on a BoP basis, goods imports registered a growth of 33.2 per 
cent in Q1 of 2011-12 which was same in the corresponding quarter of 2010-11. 
• Notwithstanding higher growth in exports relative to imports, the trade deficit, on a 
BoP basis, was higher at US$ 35.4 billion in Q1 of 2011-12 as compared with US$ 
32.3 billion during Q1 of 2010-11.

Services and Income Flows  
 Growth in services receipts and payments remained moderate during Q1 of 2011-
12 as compared with that recorded in Q1 of 2010-11. Furthermore, services receipts 
and payments were lower as compared to the preceding quarter. Rise in net 
secondary income was partly offset by net outflow on account of primary income 
during Q1 of 2011-12 (Table 2). 
• Services exports rose by 15.7 per cent (18.3 per cent in Q1 of 2010-11) mainly led 
by transportation, software and business services.  
• Net outflow on account of primary income was higher than recorded during Q1 of 
2010-11 mainly due to larger net outflow of investment income. Receipts on 
account of investment income recorded a decline of 28.4 per cent as compared to a 
decline of 3.5 per cent in the corresponding quarter mainly due to persistence of 
lower interest rate abroad. 
• Investment income payments recorded an increase of 17.3 per cent (8.6 per cent in 
Q1 of 2010-11) driven by higher interest payments.  
• Secondary income (on net basis), reflecting mainly the remittances from overseas 
Indians, at US$ 13.7 billion remained buoyant and recorded a growth of 4.6 per cent 
during Q1 over the corresponding quarter of 2010-11 (1.3 per cent in Q1 of 2010-
11).  
• Accordingly, the CAD widened to US$ 14.1 billion in Q1 of 2011-12 as compared to 
US$ 5.4 billion in the preceding quarter and US$ 12.0 in Q1 of 2010-11. At this 
level, CAD turned out to be 3.1 per cent of GDP in Q1 of 2011-12.

Capital Account 
• Capital account which includes mainly official transfers showed an outflow of  
US$ 273 million on a net basis. 
Financial Account 
The net inflows under the financial account picked up significantly during Q1 of 
2011-12 mainly on account of FDI and other investments led by loans (Table 3). 
• Net financial inflows increased to US$ 15.7 billion during Q1 of 2011-12 (US$ 13.0 
billion during Q1 in previous year). This was mainly on account of net FDI inflows to 
India (inward FDI minus outward FDI) which increased to US$ 7.2 billion during Q1 
of 2011-12 as compared to US$ 2.9 billion in Q1 of 2010-11.  
• Net loans availed by banks were higher at US$ 11.5 billion as compared to US$ 2.9 
billion in Q1 of 2010-11 mainly due to drawdown of their foreign currency assets 
held abroad as well as rise in overseas borrowings.  
• Net loans availed by non-Government and non-banking sectors (net ECBs) stood 
higher at US$ 2.9 billion as compared to US$ 2.3 billion in Q1 of 2010-11. 
• Net inflows under short-term trade credit moderated to US$ 3.1 billion in Q1 of 
2011-12 as compared to US$ 4.3 billion in Q1 of 2010-11.  
• There was a net accretion to foreign exchange reserves to the extent of US$ 5.4 
billion during Q1 of 2011-12. In nominal terms (i.e., including valuation changes), 
foreign exchange reserves increased by US$ 10.9 billion during the quarter 
reflecting depreciation of US dollar against major international currencies during the 
quarter.
