RBI Advisory on Overseas Forex Trading through 
 Electronic / Internet Trading Portals 
 
The Reserve Bank of India has today clarified that remittance in any form 
towards overseas foreign exchange trading through electronic/internet trading portals 
is not permitted under the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA), 1999. The 
Reserve Bank has also clarified that the existing regulations under FEMA, 1999 do 
not permit residents to trade in foreign exchange in domestic / overseas markets. 
 
Residents are, however, permitted to trade in currency futures and options 
contracts, traded on the stock exchanges recognised by the Securities and 
Exchange Board of India (SEBI) in India, subject to the conditions specified by the 
Reserve Bank from time to time. 
 
Background 
 
The Reserve Bank had noticed advertisements issued by electronic / internet 
portals offering trading or investing in foreign exchange with guaranteed high returns. 
Many companies even engage agents who personally contact gullible people to 
undertake forex trading/ investment schemes and entice them with promises of 
disproportionate / exorbitant returns. 
 
The Reserve Bank of India cautions the public not to remit or deposit money 
for such unauthorised transactions. The advice has become necessary in the wake 
of many residents falling prey to such tempting offers and losing money heavily in 
the recent past.
