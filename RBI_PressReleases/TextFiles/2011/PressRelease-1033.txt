Redemption of Foreign Currency Convertible Bonds (FCCBs)  
Keeping in view the need to provide a window to facilitate refinancing of 
FCCBs by the Indian companies who may be facing difficulty in meeting the 
redemption obligations, the Reserve Bank, in consultation with the Government of 
India, has decided to allow the Indian companies to refinance/ restructure the 
outstanding FCCBs issued by them. Accordingly, Indian companies are permitted to 
raise fresh ECB/FCCB as per the extant ECB guidelines under the automatic route 
to refinance their outstanding FCCBs. Restructuring of FCCBs involving change in 
the existing conversion price is not permissible. Proposals for restructuring of FCCBs 
not involving change in conversion price will, however, be considered under the 
approval route depending on the merits of the proposal. Detailed instructions are 
contained in A. P. (DIR Series) Circular No.01 dated July 04, 2011 issued by the 
Reserve Bank of India.
