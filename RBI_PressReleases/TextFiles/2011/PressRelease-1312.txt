1. Developments in India's BoP during Third Quarter of 2010-11: Trade, 
Invisibles and Capital Account 
 This article provides details on developments in India's balance of payments 
during October-December 2010 along with the partially revised data for April-June 2010 
and July-September 2010. The disaggregated data on invisibles for the first three 
quarters of 2010-11 as well as for the financial years 2007-08, 2008-09 and 2009-10 
have also been published as part of this article. 
Main Findings 
• The trade deficit in absolute terms at USD 31.6 billion during October-December 
2010 was almost of the same level as that of the corresponding quarter of the 
preceding year (USD 30.9 billion). 
• Net invisibles (invisibles receipts minus invisibles payments) increased by 17.0 
per cent during October-December 2010 (as against a decline of 19.0 per cent a 
year ago) to USD 21.9 billion. 
• Strong recovery in net invisibles surplus led to the moderation in the current 
account deficit to USD 9.7 billion (from USD 12.2 billion a year ago) despite 
higher trade deficit.  
• The capital account surplus increased only marginally to USD 14.9 billion during 
the quarter (USD 14.6 billion a year ago) as the higher net inflows under FII 
investments, external assistance, ECBs and banking capital were offset by the 
moderation in inflows under foreign direct investment (FDI) and short-term trade 
credits. 
• With capital account surplus being higher than the current account deficit, the 
overall balance was in surplus at USD 4.0 billion resulting in a net accretion to 
foreign exchange reserves of equivalent amount during October-December 2010.  
2. Union Budget 2011-12:  An Assessment  
 The article is an assessment of the Union Budget 2011-12 presented to the 
Parliament on February 28, 2011. The underlying macroeconomic framework of the 
Budget is examined along with the Central Government’s strategy to carry forward the 
process of fiscal consolidation. It also identifies some key policy initiatives announced in 
??????????2 
 
the Budget in respect of tax reforms, agriculture, infrastructure, exports and the financial 
sector.  
Main Findings  
• The Union Budget 2011-12 indicates a favourable macroeconomic outlook in 
terms of real GDP growth (9 per cent), inflation scenario (5 per cent) and 
expected moderation in current account deficit.  
• The fiscal outcome in terms of revised estimates (RE) for 2010-11 turned out to 
be better than budgeted. The Central Government’s gross fiscal deficit (GFD) and 
revenue deficit (RD), as ratios to GDP, were lower at 5.1 per cent and 3.4 per 
cent, respectively, in   2010-11 (RE) over the budgeted estimates of 5.5 per cent 
and 4.0 per cent for the same year, reflecting the impact of more than anticipated 
one-off non-tax receipts and the upward revision in GDP. 
• The budgetary estimates for 2011-12 indicate commitment to carry forward fiscal 
consolidation. The RD, as a ratio to GDP, is budgeted to remain unchanged at 
3.4 per cent of GDP in 2011-12. However, the GFD-GDP ratio is budgeted to 
decline to 4.6 per cent in 2011-12 from the level of 5.1 per cent in the previous 
year. 
• The tax-GDP ratio is budgeted to increase in 2011-12 over the previous year.  
• Sharp moderation in revenue expenditure growth and marginal decline in 
budgeted capital expenditure is expected to contain expenditure growth this year.  
• The expenditure on subsidies is budgeted to decline in 2011-12, which may be 
subject to upward risks, particularly in view of rising international fertiliser and 
petroleum prices as well as the likely introduction of National Food Security Bill. 
• Moving forward, the Government envisages corrections in RD and GFD under its 
rolling targets for 2012-13 and 2013-14. The targeted key deficit-GDP ratios to be 
achieved by 2013-14 would, however, remain higher than those recommended 
by the Thirteenth Finance Commission. 
• The Central Government intends to introduce an amendment to the Fiscal 
Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act, 2003 during the course of 
2011-12, which would lay down the fiscal roadmap for the next five years. 
3. Railway Budget 2011-12: An Assessment 
The article covers the salient features of the Railway Budget 2011-12 which was 
presented in the Parliament on February 25, 2011.  
Main Findings 
• The surplus of Railways is budgeted to increase by 28.1 per cent during 2011-12, 
reflecting higher earnings from both passenger travel and freight traffic. The 
growth in passenger earnings is budgeted to be even higher than the average for 
2007-2010 despite no revision in the fares, thereby, anticipating increased 
earnings from new train services. 
• The Railway Budget 2011-12 proposed various business-oriented policy 
measures to expand railway network, keeping in view the need to enhance 
capacity while also promoting setting up of rail-based industries and creating 
employment opportunities. The overall approach of this Budget 2011-12 has 
been to balance economic imperatives with social inclusion objective.  
• The Railway Budget 2011-12 continued to accord greater priority to safety and 
security by putting in place a reward system for the States. The emphasis on 
enhanced connectivity of underdeveloped regions is desirable to support the 
objective of inclusive development of Indian economy. 3 
 
• Among other initiatives, the Budget proposed to introduce a system of e-
procurement and e-auction to ensure transparency and economy and has 
declared 2011-12 as the Year of Green Energy.  
• Persisting high operating ratio and lower return raise a cause of concern for long-
term commercial viability of Indian Railways. In this context, the Budget’s 
emphasis on growth along with efficient functioning of Indian Railways is a step in 
the right direction.  
• Taking note of resource constraints, a number of projects are proposed to be 
undertaken under PPP mode like wagon manufacturing units, etc. The financial 
performance indicators such as operating ratio, net surplus and return on capital 
have been estimated to improve during 2011-12 but would remain lower than the 
levels attained in 1997-98. 
4. Finances of State Governments - 2010-11: Highlights 
The article presents highlights of finances of State governments based on “State 
Finances: A Study of Budgets of 2010-11” released on March 30, 2011.  
Major Highlights 
• The developments in State finances during 2008-09 to 2009-10 reflected the 
impact of a moderate slowdown in the Indian economy. Despite some 
deterioration in State finances during 2008-09, the consolidated revenue account 
of States showed surplus position, albeit lower than that in 2007-08. However, 
the impact of the macroeconomic slowdown was sharper in 2009-10 (RE), when 
revenue deficit (RD) re-emerged at the consolidated level after a gap of three 
years and the gross fiscal deficit (GFD) shot up above 3 per cent of GDP. With an 
improvement in growth prospects coupled with fiscal consolidation initiatives; 
both consolidated RD (0.3 per cent of GDP) and GFD (2.5 per cent) were 
estimated to fall in 2010-11 (BE). 
• Improvement in State finances in 2010-11 (BE) was expected to be broad-based 
as most States were likely to improve their revenue accounts in 2010-11. While 
presenting their budgets, States seemed to have shown their inclination to revert 
to the path of fiscal consolidation prescribed by the Thirteenth Finance 
Commission. 
• Correction in revenue account in 2010-11 was expected to come mainly through 
compression in revenue expenditure as a ratio to GDP from 13.0 per cent in 
2009-10 (RE) to 11.9 per cent in 2010-11 (BE). 
• Even with slippages in 2008-09 and 2009-10 on fiscal deficit targets and 
consequent higher market borrowings, the overall debt position of States at 25.0 
per cent of GDP in 2009-10 remained within the recommended target of the 
Twelfth Finance Commission. The debt-GDP ratio was expected to further 
decline in 2010-11 (BE). 
• Contemporary issues such as the fiscal roadmap for States, implications of 
recommendations of the Thirteenth Finance Commission, the proposed 
introduction of Goods and Services Tax, quality of expenditure, the cash balance 
position of States, disclosure and dissemination in State budgets and 
strengthening of State Finance Commissions have also been addressed. 
• An assessment on the role of Finance Commissions (FCs) points out that the 
scope of FCs has extended beyond the constitutional tasks of deciding the 
proportion of tax revenue to be shared with the States and determining the 
principles governing the grants-in-aid.  
• The FCs has also been assigned the task of analysing and providing 
recommendations on several other issues impinging on State government 4 
 
finances. Of late, the issues relating to augmentation of State Consolidation 
Funds to supplement the resources of local bodies and the States’ debt position 
have also been examined by the FCs. Based on a comparative analysis of 
recommended and benchmark (using the equalisation principle) transfers, it is 
observed that the equalisation component was the highest in the case of the 
Eleventh FC as the gap between recommended and benchmark transfers was 
minimum. 
5.  Survey of India's Foreign Liabilities & Assets for the Mutual Fund Companies 
(2006-2009) 
 The article presents an overview of the foreign assets and liabilities of mutual fund 
companies (MFs) in India based on the results of the Reserve Bank’s Foreign Liabilities 
& Assets Survey (FLAS). The reference period is March 2006 to March 2009 The results 
cover the responses of 40 MFs for March 2009 which opened/acquired foreign assets or 
liabilities and 31 of these companies were common during the entire survey period. The 
study analyses in detail the noticeable increase in foreign assets and foreign liabilities of 
MFs during this period and country-wise classification of the foreign assets and liabilities 
has also been made.  
Main Findings: 
• Foreign liabilities were estimated to be over seven times the foreign assets of 
MFs in March 2009 even as both recorded substantial growth. 
• The rapid growth in balance sheets of MFs was arrested during the global 
financial crisis year of 2008-09 when most parameters moderated or declined. 
• The consistently increasing trend in their reinvested earnings was also arrested 
during the crisis year. 
• As there was no investment by MFs in overseas debt securities, their overseas 
portfolio assets were solely in terms of equity investment.  
 
6. Survey of Small Borrowal Accounts: 2008 
The article presents the findings of  Survey of Small Borrowal Accounts for the 
year ended March 31, 2008 the seventh in the series and was conducted to obtain a 
profile of small borrowal accounts (accounts  each with credit limit of `2 lakhs or less) for 
which account-wise details are not collected through the Basic Statistical Returns (BSR) 
system.  
Main Findings 
• These accounts constitute about 88 per cent of all borrowal accounts, even 
though in terms of outstanding credit, their share is less than 14 per cent. 
• The survey covered 52.6 per cent of over 9.4 crore small borrowal accounts 
which accounted and 47.5 per cent of the outstanding credit `3,29,396 crores to 
small borrowers.  
• Agriculture and Personal Loans dominated the small borrowal account. About 40 
per cent of the Agricultural loans were disbursed through Kisan Credit Cards and 
about 60 per cent of agricultural loans were charged interest at the rate of 6 to 10 
per cent annually. 
• While presenting the broad structure of these accounts, separate profile of 
accounts of the women borrowers are also presented.
