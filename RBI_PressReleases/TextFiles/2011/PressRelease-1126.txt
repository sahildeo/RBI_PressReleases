 The Goa office of the Reserve Bank started functioning in 1983 with only 
Foreign Exchange Department. The department catered to the need of exporters, 
foreign tourists, non-residents and others in Goa. A Rural Planning and Credit 
Department was added to the office on April 1, 2011, to facilitate rural credit and 
achievement of annual credit plan by banks as well as to achieve financial inclusion 
in the State, by better co-ordination with State Government, banks and others.  
However, the supervision of Urban Co-operative banks in Goa was being carried out 
by the Reserve Bank’s Mumbai Office. 
 
The Reserve Bank of India is entrusted with the responsibility of regulation 
and supervision of Urban Co-operative Banks under the regulatory provisions 
contained in the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (As applicable to Co-operative 
Societies), the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 and other related statutes.
