Reserve Bank Cancels the Licence of  
Bhandari Co-operative Bank Ltd., Mumbai (Maharashtra) 
In view of the fact that Bhandari Co-operative Bank Ltd., Mumbai (Maharashtra), 
had ceased to be solvent, all efforts to revive it in close consultation with the 
Government of Maharashtra had failed and the depositors were being inconvenienced 
by continued uncertainty, the Reserve Bank of India delivered the order cancelling its 
licence to the bank as on the close of business on November 11, 2011. The Registrar of 
Co-operative Societies, Maharashtra has also been requested to issue an order for 
winding up the bank and appoint a liquidator for the bank.  It may be highlighted that on 
liquidation, every depositor is entitled to repayment of his/ her deposits up to a monetary 
ceiling of `1,00,000/- (Rupees One lakh only) from the Deposit Insurance and Credit 
Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) under usual terms and conditions.  
 The bank was granted a licence by Reserve Bank on October 26, 1987 to 
commence banking business. The bank was issued supervisory instructions on October 
4, 2005 based on the inspections findings with reference to its financial position as on 
March 31, 2005 and these supervisory instructions were modified, from time to time, 
based on the findings of the subsequent inspection reports. 
 The statutory inspection of the bank under Section 35 of the Banking Regulation 
Act, 1949 (As Applicable to Co-operative Societies) [the Act], with reference to its 
financial position as on March 31, 2009 revealed that the assessed networth of the bank 
was negative and the bank’s deposits had eroded to the extent of 0.5%. Based on the 
inspection report as on March 31, 2009, the bank was advised on January 8, 2010 that, 
in addition to the existing supervisory action, fresh lending to be allowed only from 
accretions to deposits and proceeds from loan recoveries against FDs, NSC,KVP,LIC 
policies and Government Securities only. The bank was also advised to increase its net 
worth and raise CRAR to 9% by March 31, 2010. There was severe deterioration in the 
quality of loan assets during the period under review. The loan portfolio has excessive 
concentration of Auto loans, with grave irregularities. 
 
The statutory inspection of the bank as on March 31, 2010 revealed that the 
financial position of the bank had further deteriorated.  Its assessed net worth stood at (-) 
` 999.98 lakh and assessed CRAR stood at (-) 2.5%. The erosion in deposits was to the 
extent of 9.5%. The gross and net NPAs formed 34.5% and 26.6% of the gross and net 
advances respectively. The inspection report was forwarded to the bank on October 1, 
2010 for rectification of deficiencies and compliance. However, the compliance 
submitted by the bank vide letter dated November 11, 2010 was not considered 
satisfactory as the major deficiencies observed in the inspection report continued to 
persist. 
 The statutory inspection of the bank as on March 31, 2011 revealed that the 
financial position of the bank continued to deteriorate. The assessed net worth as on 
March 31, 2011 stood at (-) ` 2555.04 lakh, CRAR stood negative at (-) 29.8% deposits 
have also been eroded to the extent of 25.6%, gross NPAs constituted 54.5% of gross 
advances, net NPAs sharply increased from 26.6% as on March 31, 2010 to 42.3% as

on March 31, 2011 and the assessed loss increased from  ` 1365.85 lakh in 2009-10 to 
` 2498.23 lakh during 2010-11. The bank had sanctioned several ‘auto-rickshaw’/ 
‘housing’ loans that turned to be fraudulent transactions.  
In view of the precarious financial position as revealed by the findings of the 
inspection with reference to its financial position as on March 31, 2011, and inability of 
the management to bring about any improvement, the bank has been placed under all-
inclusive directions under Section 35A of the Act vide directive UBD.CO.BSD-I/D-
50/12.22.021/2011-12 dated August 04, 2011, with effect from the close of business on 
August 11,  2011, for a period of six months.  
The management had not displayed sufficient firmness/ seriousness in dealing 
with the recalcitrant officers responsible for the irregularities in auto/ housing loan 
accounts and also recovery of core NPAs. The Board of Directors was ineffective and 
was responsible for deterioration in the financial position of the bank and for conducting 
the affairs of the bank in a manner detrimental to the interest of the depositors. Based on 
a requisition for supersession of the Board of Directors issued by RBI vide letter dated 
August 11, 2011, RCS superseded the Board of Directors of the bank vide his orders 
dated August 17, 2011 and appointed a Board of Administrators to manage the affairs of 
the bank.  
Serious deficiencies as mentioned above revealed that the affairs of the bank 
were being conducted in a manner detrimental to the interest of its depositors. The bank 
does not comply with the provisions of Section 11(1), 22(3) (a) and 22(3) (b) of the Act. It 
was observed that all the financial parameters of the bank had deteriorated. The 
assessed net worth which stood at (-)` 999.98 lakh as on March 31, 2010 further 
deteriorated to (-) ` 2555.04 lakh as on March 31, 2011 with deposit erosion increasing 
from 9.5% to 25.6% during the above period. There was no viable merger proposal by 
the bank. A show cause notice dated August 26, 2011 was issued to the bank requiring 
it to show cause as to why the licence granted to it under Section 22 of the Act, on 
October 26, 1987 to carry on banking business should not be cancelled and the bank be 
taken to liquidation. The bank's reply vide its letter dated September 21, 2011 was 
examined and not considered satisfactory as the bank had admitted to the precarious 
financial position. It has also stated that the gross and net NPAs have increased to 
Rs.3156.00 lakh and Rs.1981.00 lakh respectively as on August 31, 2011. The financial 
position continues to be precarious and the bank had not submitted documentary 
evidence for having brought out any improvement. 
Therefore, Reserve Bank of India took the extreme measure of cancelling licence 
of the bank in the interest of bank's depositors. With the cancellation of licence and 
commencement of liquidation proceedings, the process of paying the depositors of the 
Bhandari Co-operative Bank Ltd., Mumbai (Maharashtra), the amount insured as per the 
DICGC Act, will be set in motion subject to the terms and conditions of the Deposit 
Insurance Scheme. 
Consequent to the cancellation of its licence, Bhandari Co-operative Bank Ltd., 
Mumbai (Maharashtra) is prohibited from carrying on ‘banking business’ as defined in 
Section 5(b) of the Act.
