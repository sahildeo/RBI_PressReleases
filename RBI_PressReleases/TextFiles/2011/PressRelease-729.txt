RBI releases Draft Guidelines for  
Licensing of New Banks in the Private Sector  
 
The Reserve Bank of India released on its website today, the Draft Guidelines for 
“Licensing of New Banks in the Private Sector”. The Reserve Bank has sought 
views/comments on the draft guidelines from banks, non-banking financial institutions, 
industrial houses, other institutions and the public at large. Suggestions and comments 
on the draft guidelines may be sent by October 31, 2011 to the Chief General Manager, 
Reserve Bank of India, Department of Banking Operations and Development, Central 
Office, 13h floor, Central Office Building, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Mumbai-400001 
or emailed.  
 
Final guidelines will be issued and the process of inviting applications for setting up of 
new banks in the private sector will be initiated after receiving feedback, comments and 
suggestions on the draft guidelines, and after certain vital amendments to Banking 
Regulation Act, 1949 are in place.  
 
Key features of the draft guidelines are: 
 
(i) Eligible promoters: Entities / groups in the private sector, owned and controlled 
by residents, with diversified ownership, sound credentials and integrity and 
having successful track record of at least 10 years will be eligible to promote 
banks. Entities / groups having significant (10 per cent or more) income or 
assets or both from real estate construction and / or broking activities 
individually or taken together in the last three years will not be eligible. 
(ii) Corporate structure: New banks will be set up only through a wholly owned 
Non-Operative Holding Company (NOHC) to be registered with the Reserve 
Bank as a non-banking finance company (NBFC) which will hold the bank as 
well as all the other financial companies in the promoter group. 
(iii) Minimum capital requirement: Minimum capital requirement will be ` 500 crore. 
Subject to this, actual capital to be brought in will depend on the business 
plan of the promoters. NOHC shall hold minimum 40 per cent of the paid-up 
capital of the bank for a period of five years from the date of licensing of the 
?null???????bank. Shareholding by NOHC in excess of 40 per cent shall be brought down 
to 20 per cent within 10 years and to 15 per cent within 12 years from the 
date of licensing of the bank. 
(iv) Foreign shareholding: The aggregate non-resident shareholding in the new 
bank shall not exceed 49 per cent for the first 5 years after which it will be as 
per the extant policy. 
(v) Corporate governance: At least 50 per cent of the directors of the NOHC should 
be independent directors. The corporate structure should be such that it does 
not impede effective supervision of the bank and the NOHC on a consolidated 
basis by the Reserve Bank. 
(vi) Business model: Should be realistic and viable and should address how the 
bank proposes to achieve financial inclusion. 
(vii) Other conditions:  
• The exposure of bank to any entity in the promoter group shall not 
exceed 10 per cent and the aggregate exposure to all the entities in 
the group shall not exceed 20 per cent of the paid-up capital and 
reserves of the bank.  
• The bank shall get its shares listed on the stock exchanges within two 
years of licensing.  
• The bank shall open at least 25 per cent of its branches in unbanked 
rural centres (population upto 9,999 as per 2001 census) 
• Existing NBFCs, if considered eligible, may be permitted to either 
promote a new bank or convert themselves into banks. 
 
(viii) In respect of promoter groups having 40 per cent or more assets / income 
from non-financial business, certain additional requirements have been 
stipulated. 
 
Background 
 
It may be recalled that pursuant to the announcement made by the Union 
Finance Minister in his budget speech and the Reserve Bank’s Annual Policy Statement 
for the year 2010-11, a discussion paper on “Entry of New Banks in the Private Sector” 
was placed on RBI website on August 11, 2010. The discussion paper marshalled 
international practices, Indian experience as well as the extant ownership and 
governance (O&G) guidelines. The Reserve Bank had sought views/comments from 
banks, non-banking financial institutions, industrial houses, other institutions and the 
public at large. Discussions were also held with major stakeholders to seek their 
comments and suggestions on the issues raised in the paper. The gist of comments on 
various issues received through email and letters and discussions was placed on 
Reserve Bank’s website on December 23, 2010. The draft guidelines have been 
prepared based on the responses received, extensive internal discussions and 
consultation with the Government of India.
