Quarterly Industrial Outlook Survey: October-December 2011 (Round 56) 
 The Reserve Bank of India has launched the 56th round of the Industrial 
Outlook Survey (IOS) for reference period October–December 2011. The Reserve 
Bank has been conducting the Industrial Outlook Survey on a quarterly basis since 
1998. The survey gives an insight into the perception of the public and private limited 
companies engaged in manufacturing activities about their own performance and 
prospects. The survey covers non-financial private and public limited companies with 
a good size/industry representation. The assessment of business sentiments for the 
current quarter and expectations for the ensuing quarter are based on qualitative 
responses to 20 major parameters covering overall business situation, financial 
situation, demand indicators, price and employment expectations, profit margins, etc. 
The survey provides useful forward looking inputs for policymakers, analysts and 
business alike. 
The salient features of the survey results at the aggregate level are published 
in Monthly Bulletin of the Reserve Bank. The article on 54th round of the survey has 
been published in the August 2011 issue of the Bulletin under the title “Quarterly 
Industrial Outlook Survey: April-June 2011 (54th Round). The article can also be 
viewed or downloaded from the RBI website http://www.rbi.org.in. 
M/s Centre for Research Planning and Action, New Delhi has been mandated 
to conduct the survey for this quarter on behalf of the Reserve Bank of India. 
Manufacturing companies will be approached by this agency during the quarter. 
However, other manufacturing companies who are not approached by the agency 
can also participate in this survey by downloading the survey schedule from the 
Reserve Bank’s website www.rbi.org.in. The survey schedule is placed under the
