Background 
The Reserve Bank of India had, in the Annual Monetary Policy for 2011-12, 
announced setting up of a Committee to identify areas for streamlining and 
simplifying the procedures under Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999, so as to 
remove the operational impediments and assess the level of efficiency in the 
functioning of authorised persons, including the infrastructure created by them.  The 
Committee set up under the Chairmanship of Smt. K.J. Udeshi, submitted its report 
in early August 2011. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) placed the Report on its 
website (www.rbi.org.in), examined the recommendations and has taken up some of 
them for implementation.  The relevant circulars are available on the RBI website.  
The other recommendations of the Committee are being examined.
