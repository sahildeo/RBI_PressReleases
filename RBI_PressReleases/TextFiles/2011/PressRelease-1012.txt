RBI releases Compendium CD of Articles on State Finances 
 (1950-51 to 2010-11) 
 
The Reserve Bank of India today released Compendium CD of Articles on State 
Finances from 1950-51 to 2010-11. The Reserve Bank of India has been bringing out 
the publication ‘State Finances: A Study of Budgets’ every year since 1950-51 that 
presents a comprehensive and analytical picture of budgetary operations of State 
governments. It provides a summarised position of State finances in terms of fiscal 
indicators such as revenue and fiscal deficits and debt position at the consolidated level 
as well as at the individual State level. Apart from providing information on issues of 
topical importance, the publication sets out details of important policy measures 
undertaken by the State governments, the Centre and the Reserve Bank from time to 
time. While the articles on State finances published since 2001-02 are already available 
on RBI’s website, this Compendium CD provides access to all the articles published 
since 1950-51 to 2010-11 at one place.  
 
   The Reserve Bank’s publication on State finances has been extensively used by 
research institutions, policy makers, academicians and students from India and abroad.  
Availability of the entire series of articles in the compendium CD would provide data on 
State finances from 1950-51 onwards and facilitate research in this area.
