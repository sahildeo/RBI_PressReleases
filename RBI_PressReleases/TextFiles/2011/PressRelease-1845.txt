RBI releases Monsoon 2010 Issue of its Occasional Papers 
  The Reserve Bank of India, today released the Monsoon 2010 issue of its 
Occasional Papers. Occasional Papers, a research journal of the Reserve Bank, 
contains contributions of its staff and reflects the views of the authors. This issue is 
woven around some important themes which have been at the forefront of policy 
discussions. The issue contains articles, special notes and a book review. 
Potential Inflation Risk should motivate Faster Return to Fiscal Consolidation 
 The paper titled ‘Global Crisis, Fiscal Response and Medium-term  
Risks to Inflation in India’ by Jeevan Kumar Khundrakpam and Sitikantha Pattanaik  
has examined the empirical relationship between fiscal deficit and inflation over the 
pre-Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) period 1953-2005 as well 
as the total sample period of 1953-2009. The authors study the direct impact of fiscal 
deficit through primary expansion in reserve money by using a concept of 
‘seigniorage’, proxied by the annual change in reserve money deflated by WPI 
inflation.  
 Empirical estimates suggest that one percentage point increase in the level of 
the fiscal deficit could cause about a quarter of a percentage point increase in the 
Wholesale Price Index (WPI) over time, though the impact in the short-run may  be 
modest at only 0.04 percentage points. The paper emphasises that the potential 
inflation risk should work as an important motivating force to ensure a faster return to 
the fiscal consolidation path in India. The process according to the authors should be 
driven by adjustment based on appropriate rationalisation of expenditure, rather than 
waiting for the job to be done automatically through revenue buoyancy associated 
with sustained robust growth. The paper argues that in Indian context the fiscal 
policy should not only play the usual  role of stabilising output but also in 
occasionally containing inflationary pressures that often arise from temporary but 
large supply shocks. 
Efficient Funds Management and Other Income make Foreign Banks Profitable 
Under the section on Special Notes, the paper ‘Profitability of Foreign Banks 
vis-à-vis other Bank Groups in  India – A Panel Data Analysis’ by  Rakhe P.B 
analyses the financial performance of foreign banks in comparison with other bank 
groups in India. The paper assumes importance in the context of the on-going 
preparation of roadmap for the presence of foreign banks in India by the Reserve 
Bank. The results of the study indicate that access to low cost funds, diversification 
of income and access to other income sources to fully finance the operating 
expenses are important factors leading to higher profitability of foreign banks vis-à-
?nullnull???nullnullnull??2 
 
vis other bank groups in India. The results of the panel data regression also indicate 
that efficiency of fund management is the most important factor determining 
profitability in the banking system followed by generation of other income. The paper 
also suggests that a holistic view needs to be taken on foreign banks policy, by 
considering factors such as global financial inter-linkages, financial performance of 
parent banks as well as the pursuit of social objectives by these banks. 
Technical Studies 
 The Occasional Papers also contain two technical studies. 
The paper on ‘Forecasting Inflation and IIP Growth: Bayesian Vector 
Autoregressive Model’ by Dipankar Biswas, Sanjay Singh and Arti Sinha attempts to 
develop a VAR as well as Bayesian VAR (BVAR) model for forecasting inflation as 
well as IIP growth using quarterly data on WPI, IIP and M1 since first quarter of 
1994-95 to fourth quarter of 2007-08. Comparing the performance of these two 
models, the authors find that the forecasts, measured in terms of out-of-sample 
percentage root mean square error of VAR model being used for forecasting inflation 
as well as IIP growth, improve by applying Bayesian technique. 
The paper ‘Macroeconomic Forecasting using Dynamic Factor Models’ by  
Sanjib Bordoloi, Dipankar Biswas, Sanjay Singh, Ujjwal K. Manna and Seema 
Saggar attempts to develop Dynamic Factor Models (DFM) to forecast industrial 
production and price level in India. For this purpose, economic indicators that contain 
information about the future movements of industrial production/ price level are 
selected. From the empirical analysis, it appears that the performances of DFM are 
quite encouraging. It also finds that the out-of-sample forecast accuracy of DFM, as 
measured by root mean square percentage error, is better than the OLS regression. 
Book Review 
Shri A. Karunagaran reviews the book titled ‘The Economic Crisis and The 
State of Economics’ edited by Robert Skidelsky and Christian Westerlind Wigstrom, 
Palgrave-Macmillan, USA.  
 The recent global financial crisis, not only kicked up the debate on the 
international financial crisis per se, but has been termed as ‘moral crisis of 
capitalism’ and is also compared with the ‘Great Depression’. Predictably scores of 
conferences, symposiums have been conducted by different forums across the world 
to seek explanations on it. This book is collection of papers presented in one such 
symposium organised in February 2009. The participants in the symposium were 
renowned economists, who came out with divergent views not only on the causes of 
crises but also on the very subject ‘economics’. This book is a compilation of neatly 
edited and presented conference papers. Shri Karunagaran, however, also feels that 
given the pre-eminence of authors, they could have made more explicit suggestions 
or suggested precautions to prevent such crises in future.
