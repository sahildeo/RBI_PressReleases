The Reserve Bank of India has imposed a monetary penalty of ` 1.00 lakh 
(Rupees one lakh only) on Urban Co-operative Bank Ltd., Cuttack in exercise of 
powers vested in it under the provisions of Section 47(A)(1)(b) read with Section 
46(4) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (AACS) for violation of Reserve Bank of
