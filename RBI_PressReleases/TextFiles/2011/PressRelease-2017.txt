RBI launches  Order Books, Inventories and  
Capacity Utilisation Survey : Round 12 
The Reserve Bank of India has launched the Twelfth round of its Order 
Books, Inventories and Capacity Utilisation Survey (OBICUS). The survey is for the 
reference period October–December 2010.  
The Reserve Bank has been conducting Order Books, Inventories and 
Capacity Utilisation Survey (OBICUS) of the manufacturing sector regularly on a 
quarterly basis. The survey seeks, through a survey schedule, quantitative 
information on order books, inventories and capacity utilization, such as, pending 
order books, backlog order books, total inventories, finished goods inventories, work 
in progress inventories, installed capacity, quantity produced, capacity utilisation, 
value of production, etc., from companies involved in manufacturing activities. The 
information on installed capacity, quantity produced, value of production, etc., are 
used for calculating the capacity utilisation at industry as well as at an all India level. 
The survey has been providing a significant input to the Reserve Bank in monetary 
policy formulation.  
M/s Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy Pvt. Ltd. (CMIE), Mumbai, has 
been mandated to conduct the survey for this quarter on behalf of the Reserve Bank 
of India. The major manufacturing companies will be approached by the agency 
during the quarter. Other manufacturing companies that are not approached by the 
agency can also participate in this survey round by downloading the survey schedule 
from the Reserve Bank’s website www.rbi.org.in The survey schedule is placed 
under the Forms and subhead Survey. The duly authenticated filled-in survey 
schedule may be e-mailed or faxed to the agency as per contact details provided in 
survey schedule.
