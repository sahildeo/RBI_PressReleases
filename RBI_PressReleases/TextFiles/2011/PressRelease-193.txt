Introduction of Credit Default Swaps (CDS) for Corporate Bonds 
The Reserve Bank of India has decided to implement the guidelines relating 
to introduction of CDS for Corporate Bonds effective December 1, 2011. 
It may be recalled that Reserve Bank had issued Guidelines on CDS on May 
23, 2011.  Though these guidelines were to be effective from October 24, 2011, it 
was decided on October 20, 2011 that the implementation would be postponed to 
facilitate putting in place the necessary infrastructure. It has now been observed that 
the needed infrastructure is ready.
