Professor Maurice Obstfeld, University of California, Berkeley, 
th
delivered the 12 L. K. Jha Memorial Lecture on 
‘Gross Financial Flows, Global Imbalances, and Crises’ 
 Professor Maurice Obstfeld, University of California, Berkeley, delivered the 
twelfth L. K. Jha Memorial Lecture organised by the Reserve Bank on December 13, 
2011 in Mumbai. The topic of his lecture was ‘Gross Financial Flows, Global Imbalances, 
and Crises’. 
 Governor Dr. D. Subbarao in his welcome address noted that Prof. Obstfeld, who 
is presently the ‘Class of 1958 Professor of Economics’ and Director of the Center for 
International and Development Economic Research (CIDER) at University of California, 
Berkeley, has a truly enviable reputation as an academic in the area of international 
trade and finance, and as an adviser on economic policy making and practices. He is 
active as a Research Fellow of Centre for Economic Policy Research, a Research 
Associate at National Bureau of Economic Research and an International Research 
Fellow at the Kiel Institute of World Economics. 
1. Introduction 
 In his speech, Prof. Obstfeld presented some useful lessons from current phase of 
prolonged global crisis that mostly emanated from the progress of financial globalisation. 
He pointed out that the global economic crisis of 2007-09 and the European sovereign 
debt crisis that followed have unleashed market forces that even policymakers in the 
mature economies were ill-prepared to counteract. 
2. The Growth of Pure Asset-for-Asset International Trade 
 He documented the proliferation of gross international asset and liability positions 
and discussed some of the consequences for individual countries’ external adjustment 
processes and for global financial stability. He pointed out that, if a country has 
maximally hedged its idiosyncratic risk in world asset markets, its net international 
investment position (NIIP) will respond to shocks (including shocks to current and future 
world prices) in ways that cushion domestic consumption possibilities. 
 He mentioned that, in mid-1970s, the gross financial flows were considerably 
smaller than trade flows, but the former have grown over time and on average now are of 
comparable magnitude to trade flows. In the real world of financial trades, one agent 
viewing them as personally advantageous can work to the detriment of others implying 
that the sheer volume of financial trade can be positively correlated with financial 
instability risks. 
3. Balance Sheet Vulnerabilities 
 Once a certain level of financial integration has been reached, gross position 
build-ups likely to imply a proliferation of counter-party obligations that may be defaulted 
and thus carry the risk of contagious financial instability through chains of leverage. In 
contrast, a country’s portfolio equity or FDI liabilities can fall quickly through the price 
mechanism without creating defaults. But there is only so much domestic capital for 
?null???????null????? 2
foreigners to hold, so beyond a point, increasing gross asset positions imply increasing 
associated default possibilities, with adverse implications for financial stability. 
 In the Indian context, external liabilities are heavily weighted toward equity, 
whereas external assets are heavily weighted toward debt-like assets (in no small 
measure consisting of non-gold official reserves). In the crisis year 2008, the values of 
externally-held Indian equities collapse, improving the NIIP sharply, but they recover in 
2009-2010. These asset-price developments provide some natural insurance against 
economic shocks rather than provoking an external debt crisis. 
4. Does the Current Account Matter Anymore? 
 With investment, the current account’s role is to allow investors to maintain 
globally diversified portfolios of equity claims through purchases of newly issued shares 
in the profits of capital. The foreign gross asset and liability positions offer the best 
picture of potential stability risks, and that hazardous gross positions can build up even in 
the absence of any net international capital flows. 
 Low interest rates due to global saving and investment patterns, along with 
accommodative monetary policy responses and other government policies, promoted 
credit and housing booms that themselves led to a further widening of the global 
imbalances. Financial competition, innovation, and arbitrage, proliferating within a lax 
regulatory environment, built a financially fragile superstructure of gross liabilities and 
claims on the back of those unsustainable booms. The big U.S. external deficit was a 
symptom of underlying destabilizing forces, and indeed enabled those forces to play out 
over an extended period. 
 A purely macroeconomic perspective also argues for the continuing importance of 
the current account as a component of aggregate demand. The emergence of a current 
account surplus in one region may depress aggregate demand globally, affecting global 
financial markets and eliciting policy responses in trade partners. 
5. Conclusion 
 For several reasons, the current account still matters. The gross international 
asset and liability positions furnish the key conduit through which financial meltdown is 
transmitted and amplified. The national divergences between saving and investment not 
only remain key macro variables, they may well reflect financial developments with direct 
systemic implications. 
 The evolving world of financial globalization needs policy coordination assembling 
consolidated global information on financial activity, for regulating against macro risks, 
for providing liquidity support, and for resolving insolvent global financial institutions and 
governments. 
 Dr. Subir Gokarn, Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India highlighted the main 
messages of Prof. Obstfeld’s lecture and offered a vote of thanks.
