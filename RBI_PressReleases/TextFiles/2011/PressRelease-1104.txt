RBI to put the data on Overseas Direct Investment in the public domain 
The Reserve Bank of India has decided to put on its website on a monthly basis 
from July 2011 onwards the outflows on account of Overseas Direct Investment by 
Indian Companies / Parties as reported by the Authorized Dealers in Form ODI. The 
report will consist of the following fields, viz., the name of the Indian Company / Party, 
name of the Joint Venture / Wholly Owned Subsidiary (JV / WOS), name of the country 
where the investment is made, major activity of the JV / WOS, financial commitment of 
the parent company in the JV / WOS comprising equity, loan and guarantee issued in 
USD million. The data in respect of previous period from July 2007 till May 2011 is also 
being released. 
The initiative has been taken as part of the endeavor of the RBI and the Govt. for 
wider dissemination of information and bringing about more transparency as the JV / 
WOS have been perceived as an effective medium of economic co-operation between 
India and other countries. Such overseas investments catalyze growth in our exports, 
transfer of technology and skill, sharing of results of R & D, access to wider global 
market, promotion of brand image, generation of employment and utilization of raw 
materials available in India and in the host country. 
Indian overseas investment policies have been progressively liberalized and 
simplified to meet the changing needs of a growing economy in a globalized 
environment. The policy which was evolved as one of the strategies for export 
promotion and strengthening economic linkages with other countries, has been 
streamlined significantly in scope and size, especially after the introduction of FEMA in 
June 2000. In the post 2003 period, the policy has enabled corporate entities and 
registered partnerships to invest in bonafide businesses abroad, currently to the extent 
of 400% of their net worth, under the automatic route. The aggregate data of overseas 
investments for the last four years is furnished below:
