Macroeconomic and Monetary Developments: Second Quarter Review 2011-12 
The Reserve Bank of India today released the Macroeconomic and Monetary 
Developments Second Quarter Review 2011-12. The document serves as a 
background to the Monetary Policy Statement 2011-12 to be announced on October 
25, 2011. Highlights:   
Overall Outlook 
While inflation remains sticky, growth risks add to policy complexity  
• The baseline inflation path still remains sticky and broadly unchanged from 
earlier projections. On the other hand, growth risks have increased on account 
of global headwinds and domestic factors. On current assessment, growth in 
2011-12 is likely to moderate slightly from that projected earlier.  
 
• While persistent high inflation is impacting growth, investment is slowing down. 
The fall in new corporate fixed investment since the second half of 2010-11 has 
been significant and can impact the pipeline investment in coming years. 
  
• Inflation risk, however, persists. The policy choices have become more 
complex. In this backdrop, the monetary policy trajectory will need to be 
guided by the emerging growth-inflation dynamics even as transmission 
of the past actions is still unfolding.  
 
• Various surveys conducted, both by the Reserve Bank and the outside 
agencies, suggest that business expectations have suffered, while inflation 
expectations remain high. As a further step for increased transparency in 
monetary policy formulation, the Reserve Bank for the first time is releasing 
surveys conducted by it along with the ‘Macroeconomic and Monetary 
Developments’, one day ahead of the policy. 
Global Economic Conditions 
Global growth in siege from debt overhang 
• Prospects for global growth appear to be declining, even though recovery has 
not stalled so far. There have been significant downward revisions in growth 
projections. Business and consumer confidence have dampened on the back of 
euro area sovereign debt crisis. Private sector balance sheets are at risk and 
significant weakness in the banking sector has re-emerged. 
 
• Global commodity prices, especially those of metals, have softened but have 
stayed elevated. Even after some correction, the current Brent crude oil price is 
still over 25 per cent higher than its average for 2010-11. The IMF has revised 
upwards its consumer price inflation forecast for EDEs.

Indian Economy 
Output 
Growth moderating below trend in 2011-12 
• Growth in 2011-12 is likely to moderate to below trend. Agriculture prospects 
remain encouraging with the likelihood of a record Kharif crop. However, 
moderation is visible in industrial activity and some services.  
 
• In addition to domestic factors, global factors may slow down growth. With the 
increasing linkage of domestic industrial growth with global industrial cycle, 
some further moderation is likely ahead, given the weak global PMIs.  
 
• Capacity constraints seem to be easing in some manufacturing segments, 
especially cement, fertilizers and steel. Construction activity has slowed and 
leading indicators suggest that going forward, services growth may slightly 
weaken. 
Aggregate Demand 
Investment slowdown may impact growth ahead 
• Investment demand is softening as a result of combination of factors including 
monetary tightening, hindrances to project execution, deteriorating business 
confidence and slowing global economy.  
 
• Planned corporate fixed investment in new projects declined significantly since 
the second half of 2010-11 and has stayed low in Q1 of 2011-12. Consequently, 
the pipeline of investment is likely to shrink, putting growth in 2012-13 at risk.  
 
• Private consumption is also starting to soften in parts, but it remains robust 
overall as is evident from corporate sales performance. Sales growth continues 
to be healthy, but profits are under pressure.  
 
• Fiscal slippages during 2011-12 may complicate the task of aggregate demand 
management.  Key to growth sustainability lies in supporting investment by 
rebalancing demand from government consumption to public and private 
investment. 
External Sector 
Widening CAD poses risk if global trade and capital flows shrink 
• The Current Account Deficit (CAD) widened in Q1 of 2011-12, despite a surge in 
exports and higher net invisibles receipts. Going forward, exports could 
decelerate as global growth slows down. Invisible earnings may also decelerate 
as slow down in US and euro area could impact software exports. 
 
• Sharp decline in FII flows in Q2 of 2011-12 has been largely offset by strong FDI 
flows. However, capital flows are entering an uncertain phase with increased 
financial stress and worsening global growth prospects. External sector outlook, 
although stable, warrants close monitoring. 
Monetary and Liquidity Conditions 
Liquidity remains comfortable, credit growth stays above trajectory 
• During Q2 of 2011-12, liquidity conditions, though in deficit mode in line with the 
policy objective, remained comfortable. Base money decelerated as currency 
growth moderated. Money (M3) growth, however, moderated less sharply and 
remained above the indicative trajectory as the money multiplier increased.   3
 
• Bank credit growth is presently above the indicative trajectory. This has been 
supplemented by increased resource flows from non-banking sources. Going 
forward, credit growth is expected to moderate as growth slows. 
 
• Monetary policy has been significantly tightened since February 2010 with an 
effective increase of 500 bps in policy rates and a 100 bps increase in CRR; but 
monetary transmission is still unfolding and real interest rates remain low and 
non-disruptive to growth. 
Financial Markets 
Volatility spillovers to domestic equity and currency markets are contained 
• Volatility was high in global financial markets in Q2 of 2011-12. Rising risk 
aversion caused credit spreads to widen. Volatility spillovers impacted domestic 
currency and equity markets in a limited way. 
 
• Rupee depreciation and the fall in equity indices in Q2 of 2011-12 were 
comparable to the patterns in most other emerging markets. Money market 
rates remained in line with policy signals, while G-sec yields hardened after the 
announcement of additional market borrowing. 
Price Situation 
Inflation risks stay as falling global commodity prices provide limited comfort 
• High inflation is likely to persist over next couple of months before moderating as 
falling global commodity prices so far has been offset by rupee depreciation. 
Incomplete pass-through is likely to limit the impact of falling global commodity 
prices. Financialisation of commodities leaves future commodity price path 
uncertain.  
 
• Domestic price pressures still remain significant and broad-based. Food inflation 
is likely to stay elevated due to demand-supply mismatches in non-cereals and 
large MSP revisions. Real wage inflation has extended into Q1 of 2011-12. In 
sum, the inflation challenge remains significant.
