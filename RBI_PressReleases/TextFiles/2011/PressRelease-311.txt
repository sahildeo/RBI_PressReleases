1. Developments in India's Balance of Payments during First Quarter  
(April-June) of 2011-12 
Imports and Exports rise; Current Account Deficit widens 
 This article provides details on developments in India's balance of payments 
during April-March 2011. It also covers disaggregated data on invisibles for 2009-10 
and 2010-11 as well as for Q1 of 2011-12, through Q1 to Q4 of 2010-11. 
Main Findings
During Q1 of 2011-12, a rise in trade deficit, despite sharper increase in 
exports than imports and increase in net export of services, led to widening of 
current account deficit (CAD) as compared with Q1 of the previous year. 
• During Q1 of 2011-12, while growth in goods exports was higher than growth 
in imports, trade deficit in absolute terms widened to US$ 35.4 billion (US$ 
32.3 billion a year ago).  
• Growth in services receipts and payments remained moderate during Q1 of 
2011-12 as compared with that recorded in Q1 of 2010-11. Net exports of 
services recorded a growth of 19.1 per cent led by higher growth in receipts 
led by ‘transportation’, ‘telecommunication, computer and information 
services’ and ‘other business services’.  
• There has been rise in net secondary income but it was partly offset by net 
outflow on account of primary income. 
• During the period, despite improvement in net services and secondary 
income, higher trade deficit coupled with deterioration in the primary income 
led to increase in absolute size of current account deficit. However, as a 
proportion of GDP, CAD remained at the previous year level during the 
quarter.

• Financial account witnessed a surge primarily on account of foreign direct 
investment and other investment led by loans particularly banking capital.  
• There was a net accretion to foreign exchange reserves of US$ 5.4 billion 
during Q1 of 2011-12 (excluding valuation). 
2.  Composition and Ownership Pattern of Deposits with Scheduled 
Commercial Banks: March 2010 
Share of Term Deposits largest in Incremental Deposits 
The article presents data on ownership of deposits as collected from a sample 
of branches of scheduled commercial banks, under the reporting system of the Basic 
Statistical Return (BSR)-4. BSR-4 captures data on outstanding deposits as on 
March 31, according to type of deposits accounts (viz., current, savings and term 
deposits) and classified by broad institutional sectors, (viz., ‘Household’, 
‘Government’, ‘Private Corporate (Non-Financial)’, ‘Financial’ and ‘Foreign' sectors) 
of the economy. The ownership pattern of estimated deposits is analysed according 
to the population groups, States/Union Territories and bank groups. The article also 
provides comparative position of composition and ownership pattern of bank 
deposits in March 2010. 
Main Findings 
• Current, savings and term deposits accounted for 12.0 per cent, 25.5 per cent 
and 62.5 per cent, respectively, in the total deposits in March 2010. The share 
of term deposits declined by 2.2 percentage points during 2009-10, while that 
of savings deposits registered an increase by the same percentage points 
(2.2 per cent).   
• 'Household' sector with 58.0 per cent share in total deposits was the largest 
holder of outstanding deposits as on March 31, 2010; its share was 58.3 per 
cent a year ago. By end-March 2010, the share of 'Private Corporate (Non-
Financial)' and ‘Financial’ sector in total deposits recorded a rise, while 
’Government’ and 'Foreign' sectors depicted a decline as compared with the 
previous year.  
• Term deposits contributed 51.8 per cent to incremental deposits during 2009-
10 (73.5 per cent during 2008-09), while current and savings deposits 
accounted for an accretion at 11.6 per cent (5.2 per cent in 2008-09) and 36.6 
per cent (21.3 per cent in 2008-09), respectively. 
• The share of current deposits in total deposits recorded an increase in case of 
'Private Corporate (Non-Financial)' sector, while it registered a decline in case 
of all other sectors. On the other hand, the relative share of term deposits in 
total deposits decreased in the case of 'Private Corporate (Non-Financial)' , 
'Foreign' sectors and 'Household' sectors, and increased in case of' ‘Financial’ 
sector; it has remained unchanged in the case of 'Government' sector.  
• The share of term deposits in total deposits for the metropolitan areas stood 
at 70.5 per cent as on March 31, 2010, somewhat lower compared to 72.4 per 
cent of the previous year. Savings deposits accounted for 46.9 per cent and 
43.0 per cent share in total deposits of rural and semi-urban areas, 
respectively, whereas their shares increased for the urban and metropolitan 
areas during 2009-10.

3. India’s External Debt: Trend, Policy Changes and Cross-country 
Comparison 
Rise in Debt Servicing Ratio but External Debt to Reserves Ratio Comfortable 
The article reviews India’s external debt position as of end-June 2011, 
provides cross-country comparison of external debt among select developing 
countries and presents recent policy measures undertaken by the Reserve Bank of 
India and Government of India for effective management of external debt. The 
article, among other things, provides details about the components of external debt, 
its currency composition, instrument wise classification and maturity profile as at 
end-June 2011. 
Main Findings  
• India’s external debt, as of end-June 2011, was at US$ 317 billion.  
• The long-term debt at US$ 248.5 billion and short-term debt at US$ 68.5 
billion accounted for 78.4 per cent and 21.6 per cent, respectively, of the total 
external debt. 
• Based on residual maturity, short-term debt accounted for 43.3 per cent of 
total external debt.  
• In terms of currency composition, USD accounted for 54 per cent of total 
external debt.  
• While, debt servicing ratio rose marginally, the ratio of external debt to 
reserves ratio has remained almost at the same level as at end-June 2011. 
4. Finances of Foreign Direct Investment Companies: 2009-10  
Share of External Sources of Funds declined  
The article presents the financial performance of select 681 non-government 
non-financial foreign direct investment companies during the financial year 2009-10, 
based on their audited annual accounts.  
Main Findings  
• The aggregate results of the select companies in 2009-10 showed signs of 
recovery since 2008-09. 
• While the growth rates in major parameters like sales, value of production and 
manufacturing expenses further moderated, various measures of profit like 
PBDIT, gross profits, profit after tax and gross savings recorded higher growth 
in 2009-10 after witnessing a decline in 2008-09. 
• Profitability and profit allocation ratios such as profit margin, return on equity 
and dividends to net worth improved in 2009-10 as compared to those in 
2008-09.  
• However, growth in borrowings was at a much lower level in 2009-10 as 
compared with the previous year, as increase in profitability could have led to 
significant cut down in the borrowing requirement.  
• The share of external sources of funds (i.e., other than own sources), which 
has been playing a major role in financing the asset formation and other 
activities during the last few years, witnessed a significant decline in 2009-10 
mainly due to the fall in incremental borrowings and equity raising. 
Correspondingly, the share of the internal sources of funds increased and 
became major source of finance, backed by higher accretion in reserves and 
surplus in 2009-10. 4 
 
• The FDI companies experienced lower growth is sales and higher growth in 
gross profits and profit after tax compared to those of non-FDI companies in 
2009-10. The profit margins, return on equity and effective tax rate of FDI 
companies were higher as compared with that of non-FDI companies in 2009-
10. 
5.  South-West Monsoon 2011 :  A Review  (June 1 to September 30, 2011) 
Good Monsoon augurs well for Agriculture and Allied Activities 
The article notes that the South-west Monsoon during June-September 2011 
crossed the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) long period average (LPA) 
(average rainfall of 89 cm during 1941-1990) by 1 per cent as against 2 per cent of 
LPA during June-September 2010. This augurs well for the growth of agriculture and 
allied activities. 
Main Findings  
• Due to favourable inter-temporal and inter spatial distribution of rainfall during 
monsoon 2011 area sown during kharif 2011-12 has surpassed that sown 
during 2010-11 barring that for pulses and coarse cereals.   
• Area sown under most commercial crops has surpassed even the normal 
sowing area for the season.  
• Improved sowing, in turn, has been reflected in better prospects of kharif 
harvest as per the First Advance Estimates.  
• Production of  kharif foodgrains during 2011-12 is estimated to be 3.1 per cent 
higher than the record production of 120.2 million tonnes achieved during 
2010-11.  
• Higher sowing under commercial crops has also been reflected in estimated 
increase in production of cotton, jute & mesta, and sugarcane for the kharif 
season 2011-12.
