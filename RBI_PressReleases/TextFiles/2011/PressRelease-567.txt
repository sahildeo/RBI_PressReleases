Draft Revised Guidelines on Securitisation Transactions 
 
The Reserve Bank of India has, today, placed on its website the draft Revised 
Guidelines on Securitisation Transactions for public comments.  
 
In the light of developments in the domestic and international financial 
markets, Reserve Bank had reviewed the extant guidelines on securitisation of 
standard assets and placed the draft guidelines on minimum lock-in period/Minimum 
Holding Period (MHP) and Minimum Retention Requirements (MRR) for Indian 
banks on its website on April 19, 2010 for feedback from the market participants. The 
draft guidelines were accompanied by a discussion paper titled ‘Emerging Trends in 
Regulation and Supervision of Securitisation Activities of Banks’. The discussion 
paper mentioned inter alia that Reserve Bank would also consider laying down 
specific regulatory norms for transactions involving transfer of loans through direct 
assignment between banks as also between banks and other entities.      
 
The feedback received from banks and other market participants on the draft 
guidelines has been examined. In the meantime, some international jurisdictions 
have also finalized regulatory norms on Minimum Retention Requirement, due 
diligence required to be carried out by investors and disclosures to be made by the 
originators of securitized loans. In addition, existing regulatory norms on booking of 
profit on transfer of assets, reset of credit enhancements and transactions involving 
transfer of loans through direct assignment have been reviewed. Since the draft 
guidelines issued in April 2010 have been considerably revised to reflect all the 
aforesaid changes, it is proposed to provide another opportunity to banks and other 
market participants to offer their comments on the proposed guidelines. The revised 
draft guidelines are given in Annex. 
 
 Comments on the draft guidelines may be forwarded to the Chief General 
Manager-in-Charge, Department of Banking Operations and Development, Reserve 
th
Bank of India, Central Office Building, 12 Floor, Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Fort, 
Mumbai - 400001 or emailed, latest by October 14, 2011.
