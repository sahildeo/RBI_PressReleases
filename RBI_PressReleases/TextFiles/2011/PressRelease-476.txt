These were some of the decisions taken at the special State Level Bankers’ 
Committee (SLBC) meeting held today in Jaipur. Dr. D Subbarao, Governor, 
Reserve Bank of India chaired the special SLBC meeting, which was attended by 
senior officials of the State and Central Governments, National Bank for 
Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), National Housing Bank (NHB) 
and bankers apart from the Reserve Bank (officials). The Governor and other 
?null???????senior officials of RBI are in Jaipur to attend a meeting of the Reserve Bank’s 
Central Board of Directors being held in Jaipur on October 13, 2011.  
While in Jaipur, the Reserve Bank Governor met Shri Ashok Gehlot, the 
Hon’ble Chief Minister of Rajasthan and discussed issues of mutual interest. He 
along with Deputy Governors Dr. K C Chakrabarty, Dr. Subir Gokarn, Shri Anand 
Sinha and Shri H R Khan also addressed the Rajasthan Chamber of Commerce. 
 Earlier in the day, while inaugurating the Newsibition at Jawahar Kala 
Kendra, Jaipur in the presence of students from Maharani Gayatri Devi Girls 
School, Neerja Modi School and Saraswati Senior Secondary School, the 
Governor briefly interacted with the students and answered their questions 
relating to the Indian economy and the Reserve Bank functioning.  The 
Newsibition showcases some of the historic events from the 75 years of the 
Reserve Bank’s history through photographs, documents and newspaper 
clippings. Hence the moniker ‘Newsibition’. The Newsibition is a part of the 
Reserve Bank’s efforts to demystify itself and tell people about ‘What the 
Reserve Bank does and why is it important’.
