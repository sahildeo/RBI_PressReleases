The Reserve Bank of India today released the June Issue of its RBI Bulletin.  
June issue of the Bulletin carries four special articles:  
(i) India’s Foreign Trade, 2010-11 (April-March) 
 
(ii) Inflation Expectations Survey of Households: March 2011 (Round 23)  
 
(iii) Quarterly Industrial Outlook Survey: January-March 2011 - (Round 53) 
 
(iv) Survey on Computer Software and Information Technology Services 
Exports: 2009-10.  
Highlights of the special articles are: 
1. India’s Foreign Trade, 2010-11 (April-March):  
Exports maintain Growth Momentum  
The article reviews the performance of India’s merchandise trade during 
2010-11 on the basis of data released by Directorate General of Commercial 
Intelligence and Statistics (DGCI&S). The article also covers disaggregated 
commodity-wise and direction-wise analysis of India’s trade during 2010-11 (April-
December). 
Main Findings 
• During 2010-11 (April-March), India’s merchandise exports at US$ 245.6 
billion recorded a growth of 37.8 per cent over the corresponding period of 
previous year as against a decline of 2.5 per cent during 2009-10.  
• Merchandise imports at US$ 350.5 billion registered an increase of 21.9 per 
cent (as against a decline of 3.8 per cent a year ago).  
• On a monthly basis, exports maintained the growth momentum in the recent 
months while imports generally showed deceleration barring decline during 
December 2010, partly on account of base effect.  
• The oil and non-oil imports registered growth rates of 16.7 per cent and 24.2 
per cent in 2010-11 as against declines of 7.0 per cent and 2.4 per cent, 
respectively, during the corresponding period of the preceding year.  
• The disaggregated data on commodity-wise merchandise export reveal that 
during 2010-11 (April-December) items, such as, engineering goods, 
petroleum products, agriculture and allied products, and gems and jewellery 
contributed the most to the overall growth in exports.  
• Destination-wise, exports have diversified towards developing countries.

2. Inflation Expectations Survey of Households: March 2011 (Round 23)  
Households expect inflation to rise in April-June Quarter  
            The article presents the findings of Inflation Expectations Survey of 
rd
Households conducted in the January–March 2011 quarter, the 23 round in the 
series. The survey captures the inflation expectations of 4000 urban households 
across 12 cities for the next quarter (April-June 2011) and for the next year (April 
2011-March 2012). 
           The inflation survey represents the inflation expectations of 4,000 urban 
households based on their individual consumption baskets. The rates predicted in 
the Survey, therefore, should not be considered as RBI predictions of inflation. The 
households’ inflation expectations provide useful directional information on near-term 
inflationary pressures and also supplement other economic indicators.  
Main Findings  
• Households expect inflation to rise further by 40 and 120 basis points during 
next quarter (11.9 per cent) and next year (12.7 per cent), respectively, from 
the perceived current rate of 11.5 per cent. 
• Households' expectations of general price rise were mainly influenced by 
movements in food prices. The percentage of respondents expecting price 
rise have gone down for all product groups (namely, general prices, food 
products, non-food, household durables, housing and services).  
• Daily-wage workers and housewives expected higher inflation rates compared 
to other categories. Across cities, Bangalore registered the highest inflation 
expectations and Patna the lowest. 
3. Quarterly Industrial Outlook Survey: January-March 2011 (Round 53)  
Moderation of Business Conditions  
rd
The article presents the survey findings of the 53 round of the Industrial 
Outlook Survey. The Survey was conducted for January-March 2011 quarter and 
gives the assessment of business situation of companies in manufacturing sector, for 
the quarter January-March-2011, and their expectations for the ensuing quarter 
April-June 2011.  
Main Findings 
• The survey results signal moderation of business conditions in the Indian 
manufacturing sector for assessment quarter as well as expectation quarter.  
• The Business Expectation Index – a measure that gives a single snapshot of 
the industrial outlook in each study quarter – declined marginally from 122.8 
to 122.0 for assessment quarter and more visibly from 125.9 to 121.9 for the 
expectation quarter; however, it has still remained much higher than 100 
which is the threshold that separates contraction from expansion. 
4. Survey on Computer Software and Information Technology Services 
Exports: 2009-10  
Software Exports stable; US Dollar Major Invoicing Currency   
The article presents the results of the annual comprehensive survey for 2009-
10 and the quarterly sample survey for the first three quarters of 2009-10 on exports 
of software and IT services. The survey is conducted by the Reserve Bank of India to 
assess various aspects of software services exports. In all, 890 companies, including 
many of the major companies, responded to the survey which covered nearly 83 per 
cent of the total software exports during 2009-10.  3 
 
Main Findings 
• The share of software services exports from India remained at around 23-24 
per cent of total global software services exports in first three quarters of 
2009-10 and increased to 30 per cent in the last quarter. 
• Total software services exports (computer services and ITES/BPO services 
exports) of India during 2009-10 was estimated at `1,83,692 crore (US$ 38.7 
billion), of which computer services exports accounted for nearly 69 per cent.  
• Public limited companies, which were about 7 per cent of the respondent 
companies for the annual survey, accounted for around 58 per cent of India’s 
exports of software services. 
• Delivery of software services exports through off-site mode increased by       
19 per cent in 2009-10 and accounted for around 78 per cent of the total 
software exports. On the other hand, on-site mode delivery declined by 14 per 
cent and its share in total software exports reduced to 22 per cent. 
• With 61 per cent share in India’s total software exports in 2009-10, USA 
remained the major destination for software exports. The European countries 
accounted for 26.5 per cent share, of which UK alone accounted for 12.4 per 
cent. The US Dollar, with 76 per cent share, was the major currency for 
invoicing software exports.
