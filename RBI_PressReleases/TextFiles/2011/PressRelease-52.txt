RBI removes Limits on Mobile Banking Transactions 
The Reserve Bank of India yesterday removed the ceiling of Rs. 50,000 per 
customer per day mandated in 2009 under the guidelines on mobile banking. Banks 
are now free to place per transaction limits based on their own risk perception with 
the approval of its Board. 
The first guidelines on mobile banking transactions in India, issued by the 
Reserve Bank in October 2008 placed certain monetary restrictions on the fund 
transfer transaction through this medium, as the mobile technology at that time was 
relatively new. These monetary restrictions were then relaxed in December 2009 
based on request from banks and the need to give impetus to mobile banking in the 
country.  
Banks are increasingly extending mobile banking facilities (financial) to their 
customers. As on date, the Reserve Bank has approved 52 banks for extending the 
service. Total transactions effected through mobile banking in 2010-11 were 9.60 
million (value - ` 7806.48 million) as compared to that of 2009-10 was 2.32 million 
(value - ` 1915.78 million) - an increase of more than 300 per cent in terms of 
volume and value. Interbank Mobile Payment Service (IMPS) developed and 
operated by National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has also enabled real 
time transfer of funds through the medium of mobile phone between accounts in 
different banks.   
Keeping in line with the developments in mobile technology, increasing 
sophistication of mobile access devices, increase in options for remote connectivity 
and mobile application security, the distinction between various channels are 
becoming blurred. The Reserve Bank has not prescribed any limit on account to 
account fund transfers through other channels, such as, internet banking.
