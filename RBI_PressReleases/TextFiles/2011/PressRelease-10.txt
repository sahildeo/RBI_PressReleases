On a balance of payments basis (i.e., excluding valuation effects), the foreign 
exchange reserves increased by US$ 5.7 billion during April-September 2011 as 
compared with an increase of US$ 7.0 billion during the same period previous year. 
The foreign exchange reserves (including the valuation effects) increased by US$ 
6.7 billion during April-September 2011 as against an increase of US$ 13.8 billion

The valuation gains, reflecting the depreciation of the US dollar against major 
currencies, amounted to US$ 0.9 billion during April-September 2011 as compared 
with valuation gain of US$ 6.8 billion during the same period last year. Accordingly, 
valuation gains accounted for 13.4 per cent of the total increase in foreign exchange 
reserves during April-September of 2011-12.
