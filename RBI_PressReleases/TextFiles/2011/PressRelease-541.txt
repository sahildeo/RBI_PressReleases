India’s External Debt as at the end of June 2011 
As per the standard practice, India's external debt statistics for the quarters 
ending March and June are released by the Reserve Bank of India and those for the 
quarters ending September and December by the Ministry of Finance, Government of 
India. The external debt data are released with a lag of one quarter. The data on external 
debt outstanding as at end-June 2011 along with revised data for the earlier quarters are 
set out in Statement 1 and 2. The major developments relating to India’s external debt as 
at end-June 2011 are presented in the following paragraphs. 
Major Highlights  
i) India’s external debt,  as at end-June 2011, was placed at US$ 317.0 billion 
recording an increase of US$ 10.5 billion or 3.4 per cent over the level at end-
March 2011. About 70 per cent of the increase in total external debt during the 
quarter was on account of commercial borrowings and short-term trade credits 
broadly reflecting surge in imports. 
ii)  Excluding the valuation effects due to the depreciation of the US dollar against 
other major international currencies and the Indian rupee, the increase in external 
debt as at end-June worked out to US $ 9.1 billion over end-March 2011. 
iii) The share of commercial borrowings in total external debt continued to be the 
highest at 29.4 per cent as at end-June 2011, followed by short-term debt (21.6 
per cent), NRI deposits (16.7 per cent) and multilateral debt (15.6 per cent). 
iv) Based on residual maturity, short-term debt accounted for 43.3 per cent of the 
total external debt as at end-June 2011. Of this, the share of NRI deposits was the 
highest at 32.0 per cent. The share of short-term debt, by original maturity, was 
21.6 per cent. 
v) The ratio of short-term debt to foreign exchange reserves rose marginally to 21.7 
per cent as at end-June 2011 from 21.3 per cent as at end-March 2011. 
vi) The debt denominated in US dollar accounted for the highest share with 54.2 per 
cent in total external debt as at end-June 2011 followed by the Indian rupee (19.2 
per cent) and Japanese Yen (11.1 per cent). 
vii) The ratio of foreign exchange reserves to external debt as at end June 2011 at 
99.6 per cent remained almost at the same level as at end-March 2011. 
1. India’s External Debt as at end-June 2011 
viii) India’s external debt, as at end-June 2011, was placed at US$ 317 billion  
recording an increase of US$ 10.5 billion or 3.4 per cent over the end-March 2011 
level primarily on account of considerable increase in commercial borrowings, 
short-term trade credits and NRI deposits. 
?nullnull???nullnullnull?? 2
ix) The long-term debt at US$ 248.5 billion and short-term debt at US$ 68.5 billion 
accounted for 78.4 per cent and 21.6 per cent, respectively, of the total external 
debt as at end-June 2011. 
x) The share of commercial borrowings stood highest at 29.4 per cent in the total 
external debt as at end-June 2011 followed by short-term debt (21.6 per cent), 
NRI deposits (16.7 per cent) and multilateral debt (15.6 per cent) (Table 1).

level at end-March 2011. 
 
3. Components of External Debt

7. Select Indicators of External Debt 
 
XVI) While the ratio of India’s foreign exchange reserves to the external debt stock at 
the end of June 2011 remained more or less at the same level as at end-March 
2011, other indicators such as the ratios of concessional debt in total external 
debt, short-term debt to foreign exchange reserves and short-term debt to total 
debt showed some deterioration at end-June 2011 as compared to the end-March 
2011. Debt service ratio recorded moderate deterioration as at end-June 
2011over end-March 2011 on account of higher repayments under commercial 
borrowings (Table 5).
