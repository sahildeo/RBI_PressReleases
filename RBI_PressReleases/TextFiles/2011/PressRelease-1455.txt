RBI announces Auction of 63-day Cash Management Bills 
The Reserve Bank of India has today announced the auction of 63-day 
Government of India Cash Management Bills for a notified amount of ` 8,000 crore. 
The auction will be conducted on April 19, 2011 using "Multiple Price Auction" 
method. The Cash Management Bills will be repaid at par on June 22, 2011. The 
competitive bids for the auction should be submitted in electronic format on the 
Negotiated Dealing System (NDS) between 10.30 a.m. and 12.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 
April 19, 2011. Results will be announced on the same day. Payments by successful 
bidders will be on Wednesday April 20, 2011. 
It may be recalled that the Government of India, in consultation with the 
Reserve Bank of India, had, in August 2009, decided to issue a new short term 
instrument to meet the temporary cash flow mismatches of the Government. The 
press release issued by the Reserve Bank and the Government at that time said the 
new instrument, known as Cash Management Bills, will be non-standard, discounted 
instruments issued for maturities less than 91 days. The Cash Management Bills will 
have the generic character of Treasury Bills and their sale will be subject to the 
terms and conditions specified in the General Notification No. F.2 (12)-W&M/97 
dated March 31, 1998 issued by Government of India and as amended from time to 
time. 
Features of Cash Management Bills:
• The tenure, notified amount and date of issue of the proposed Cash 
Management Bills will depend upon the temporary cash requirement of the 
Government. However, the tenure of the proposed Bills will be less than 91 
days. 
• The settlement of the auction will be on T+1 basis. 
• The Non-Competitive Bidding Scheme for Treasury Bills will not be extended 
to the Cash Management Bills. 
• The proposed Bills will be tradable and qualify for ready forward facility. 
Investment in the proposed Bills will be reckoned as an eligible investment in 
Government Securities by banks for SLR purpose under Section 24 of the 
Banking Regulation Act, 1949.
