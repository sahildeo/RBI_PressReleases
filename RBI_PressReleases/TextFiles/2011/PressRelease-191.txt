In view of the fact that Bharat Urban Co-operative Bank Ltd., Solapur

inconvenienced by continued uncertainty, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) delivered 
the order cancelling its licence to the bank as on the close of business on November 
25, 2011. The Registrar of Co-operative Societies, Maharashtra has also been 
requested to issue an order for winding up the bank and appoint a liquidator for the 
bank. It may be highlighted that on liquidation, every depositor is entitled to 
repayment of his/her deposits up to a monetary ceiling of `1,00,000/- (Rupees One

continued to deteriorate further as revealed during subsequent inspections
