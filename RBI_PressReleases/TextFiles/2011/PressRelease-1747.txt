One More Step towards Transparency : 
RBI releases Minutes of TAC on Monetary Policy 
The Reserve Bank of India today released, for the first time, the minutes of 
the meeting of the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) on Monetary Policy held on 
January 19, 2011 in the run up to the Third Quarter Review of the Monetary Policy 
announced on January 25, 2011.  This follows the decision of placing in public 
domain, the main points of discussion at the TAC with a lag of roughly four weeks 
after the meeting of the Committee. 
Background   
The Reserve Bank of India constituted a Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) 
on Monetary Policy in July 2005 with a view to further strengthening the consultative 
process in monetary policy formulation, with external experts in the areas of 
monetary economics, central banking, financial markets and public finance. The 
Committee was last reconstituted in July 2009. The role of the Committee is advisory 
in nature. While the Reserve Bank takes into account the advice of the Committee, 
its final decision is in no way constrained by the views of the Committee. The 
Reserve Bank alone is responsible and accountable for policy actions and the time 
paths for decision-making. 
It has been the endeavour of the Reserve Bank to place in public domain all 
such data/inputs as go into the formulation of monetary policy. The publishing of data 
on inflation expectation survey conducted by the Reserve Bank is an example of 
such efforts. Since discussions in the TAC are an important input for the formulation 
of monetary policy, it has been decided to place the main points of discussion of the 
Committee in public domain with a lag of roughly four weeks after the meeting of the 
Committee.
