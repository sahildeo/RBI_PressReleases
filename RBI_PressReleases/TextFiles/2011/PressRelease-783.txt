Minutes of the July 20, 2011 Meeting of the 
Technical Advisory Committee on Monetary Policy  
                     
 The Reserve Bank has been placing the main points of discussion of the 
Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) on Monetary Policy meeting in public domain 
with a lag of roughly four weeks after its meeting. Accordingly, the minutes of the 
twenty-fourth meeting of the TAC held on April 27, 2011 were placed in public domain 
on May 30, 2011. The twenty-fifth meeting of the Committee was held on July 20, 
2011 in the run up to the First Quarter Review of the Monetary Policy 2011-12 on July 
26, 2011. The main points of discussion of this meeting are set out below.    
2. The Committee reviewed the global and domestic macroeconomic 
developments. It felt that the global macroeconomic situation had worsened with the 
uncertainty clouding the increase in the US debt ceiling issue and continuing problem 
in the euro area.  If the US debt crisis was not resolved satisfactorily, it would have 
serious ramifications for the global economy. They were also concerned that if the 
euro area sovereign debt problem spilled over to Spain and Italy, the consequences 
could be serious. While the international commodity prices had softened, the outlook 
was still uncertain. Members also expressed concerns over rising incipient 
inflationary pressures in advanced economies, even as the emerging market 
economies (EMEs) were still battling with high inflation.  
3. On the domestic macroeconomic developments, most members observed 
that investment activity was slowing down due to a variety of factors. However, the 
?null??????? 
 
overall growth was still strong in comparison with most other EMEs. According to the 
Committee, inflation continued to be a major concern.  The inflation rate continued to 
be stubbornly high.  Inflation expectations were high and wages were rising.  This 
could worsen the vicious wage-prices spiral, which to some extent was already 
evident. According to some members, inflation was driven largely by cost push factors, 
which was not amenable to monetary policy action. Most members felt that inflation 
was expected to moderate, although the risk on the monsoon front remained. In view 
of global uncertainty and deceleration of domestic economic activity, most members 
suggested that equal weight be given to the objectives of fostering growth and 
controlling inflation while formulating monetary policy. 
4. Most members felt that there could be a slippage in the fiscal deficit budgeted in 
the Union Budget  2011-12.  They were concerned that the fiscal situation had placed the 
entire burden of inflation management on monetary policy.  Uncertainty about the fiscal 
situation would continue to pose a serious challenge for monetary policy. Some members 
also observed there had been no major economic reforms in the recent period. 
5. On monetary measures, while one member suggested an increase in the 
repo rate by 25 basis points, two members felt that the increase in the policy rate be 
avoided, if possible. However, if the Reserve Bank needed to give a signal to the 
market about its continuing anti-inflationary stance, it could raise the repo rate by 25 
basis points. Other four members of the Committee were of the view that the past 
monetary policy actions had an impact and the transmission was still playing out. In 
view of this, as also the fact that the uncertainty in the global environment had 
increased and domestic investment was slowing down, they suggested that the 
Reserve Bank should follow a wait and watch policy.  Hence, the repo rate should not be 
changed.  One member suggested an increase in CRR by 25 basis points, segmented in 
such a way that the long-term investment  was encouraged.  A member also felt that 
the Reserve Bank could give clear signals of more stringent capital requirements in 
future, at least for systemically important financial institutions.   
6. The meeting was chaired by Dr. D. Subbarao, Governor. Other members 
present were: Dr. Subir Gokarn, Vice-Chairman, Dr. K.C. Chakrabarty, Shri H.R.
