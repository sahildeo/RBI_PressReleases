RBI's Rajbhasha Shield Awards Ceremony 
 "In the past sixty years if banking has not reached to every nook and corner of 
the country and has not reached to every citizen of the country then one of the reasons 
is also that country's common man's language and banking language has been 
different. There is a gap between the two which does not allow the benefits of one to 
pass it on to the other. We have to reduce that gap and for this Hindi as well as other 
Indian languages can work as a bridge." 
Dr. D. Subbarao, Governor, Reserve Bank of India expressed these views while 
awarding the Rajbhasha Shields for the year 2009-2010. He added that today truly the 
Hindi has become the contact language of the country. Therefore, instead of bringing 
Hindi to Banking, by bringing banking to Hindi only we will achieve success in our 
efforts for financial inclusion. 
The annual Reserve Bank Rajbhasha Shield was instituted in 1980 to encourage 
public sector banks to use Hindi in their day-to-day work. The Reserve Bank also 
conducts a competition for the house journals of banks and financial institutions. The 
Reserve Bank started an Inter-Bank Hindi Essay Competition from 2002-03. List of 
winners is enclosed. 
 On this occasion Dr. K.C. Chakrabarty, Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India 
while complimenting the prize winning banks and financial institutions said that today 
we are taking banking to the door-steps of the common persons and for this language 
or say the language that the bank customers understand plays an important role. Hindi 
is not only Government's official language but today it has become the contact 
language of the country. Encouraging the use of Hindi is not only our statutory 
responsibility but it is also necessary for taking banking to the common person. 
Earlier, Shri Sandip Ghose, Chief General Manager-in-charge, Department of 
Administration and Personnel Management welcomed the Chief Executives of banks 
and financial institutions. Dr. Ramakant Gupta, Deputy General Manager, Rajbhasha 
Department, Reserve Bank of India conducted the programme and also proposed a 
vote of thanks. 
 The function was attended by chairmen and other senior executives of banks 
and financial institutions.
