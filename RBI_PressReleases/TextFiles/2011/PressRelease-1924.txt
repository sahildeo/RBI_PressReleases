RBI releases Report of the Sub-Committee of its Central Board of Directors 
to study Issues and concerns in the MFI Sector 
The Reserve Bank of India today released on its website the Report of the 
RBI Sub-Committee of its Central Board of Directors to study Issues and concerns in 
the micro finance institutions (MFI) Sector. 
The Sub-Committee has recommended creation of a separate category of 
NBFCs operating in the microfinance sector to be designated as NBFC-MFIs. To 
qualify as a NBFC-MFI, the Sub-Committee has stated that the NBFC should be “a 
company which provides financial services pre-dominantly to low-income borrowers, 
with loans of small amounts, for short-terms, on unsecured basis, mainly for income-
generating activities, with repayment schedules which are more frequent than those 
normally stipulated by commercial banks” and which further satisfies the regulations 
specified in that behalf.  
The Sub-Committee has also recommended some additional qualifications for 
NBFC to be classified as NBFC-MFI. These are: 
(a)  The NBFC-MFI will hold not less than 90% of its total assets (other than cash 
and bank balances and money market instruments) in the form of qualifying 
assets. 
(b)   There are limits of an annual family income of Rs.50,000 and an individual 
ceiling on loans to a  single borrower of Rs.25,000 
(c)   Not less than 75% of the loans given by the MFI should be for income-
generating purposes. 
(d)   There is a restriction on the other services to be provided by the MFI which 
has to be in accordance with the type of service and the maximum percentage 
of total income as may be prescribed. 
The Sub-Committee has recommended that bank lending to NBFCs which 
qualify as NBFC-MFIs will be entitled to “priority lending” status. With regard to the 
interest chargeable to the borrower, the Sub-Committee has recommended an 
average “margin cap” of 10 per cent for MFIs having a loan portfolio of Rs. 100 crore 
and of 12 per cent for smaller MFIs and a cap of 24% for interest on individual loans. 
It has also proposed that, in the interest of transparency, an MFI can levy only three 
charges, namely, (a) processing fee (b) interest and (c) insurance charge. 
The Sub-committee has made a number of recommendations to mitigate the 
problems of multiple-lending, over borrowing, ghost borrowers and coercive methods 
of recovery. These include: 
(a) A borrower can be a member of only one Self-Help Group (SHG) or a  Joint 
Liability Group (JLG) 
(b) Not more than two MFIs can lend to a single borrower 
??????????2 
 
(c) There should be a minimum period of moratorium between the disbursement 
of loan and the commencement of recovery 
(d) The tenure of the loan must vary with its amount 
(e) A Credit Information Bureau has to be established 
(f)  The primary responsibility for avoidance of coercive methods of recovery 
must lie with the MFI and its management 
(g) The Reserve Bank must prepare a draft Customer Protection Code to be 
adopted by all MFIs 
(h) There must be grievance redressal procedures and establishment of 
ombudsmen 
(i) All MFIs must observe a specified Code of Corporate Governance 
For monitoring compliance with regulations, the Sub-Committee has proposed 
a four-pillar approach with the responsibility being shared by (a) MFI (b) industry 
associations (c) banks and (d) the Reserve Bank. 
While reviewing the proposed Micro Finance (Development and Regulation) 
Bill 2010, the Sub- Committee has recommended that entities governed by the 
proposed Act should not be allowed to do business of providing thrift services. It has 
also suggested that NBFC-MFIs should be exempted from the State Money Lending 
Acts and also that if the recommendations of the Sub-Committee are accepted, the 
need for the Andhra Pradesh Micro Finance Institutions (Regulation of Money 
Lending) Act will not survive. 
The Sub-Committee has cautioned that while recognising the need to protect 
borrowers, it is also necessary to recognise that if the recovery culture is adversely 
affected and the free flow of funds in the system interrupted, the ultimate sufferers 
will be the borrowers themselves as the flow of fresh funds to the microfinance 
sector will inevitably be reduced. 
Background

Sub-Committee of its Central Board of Directors to study the issues and concerns in

member on the Reserve Bank’s Central Board of Directors. Other members of the 
Sub-Committee included Shri Kumar Mangalam Birla, Dr. K C Chakrabarty, Deputy
