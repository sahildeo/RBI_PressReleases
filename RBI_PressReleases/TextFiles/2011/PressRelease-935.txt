Monitoring Group on Cash and Debt Management of GOI met today  
 
The Monitoring Group on Cash and Debt Management met today in New Delhi. The 
cash position and market borrowing of the Government was reviewed. It has been decided 
that there will be no change in the amount of market borrowing through dated securities with 
reference to the first half (April-September 2011) borrowing calendar published earlier.  
However, the Reserve Bank of India, in consultation with the Government of India, has 
decided to shift the auction of dated securities scheduled in the week ending September 23, 
2011 to week ending August 19, 2011 to modulate the cash flows. It was also decided that 
temporary mismatches in cash flows, if any, would be managed by issuance of Cash 
Management Bills (CMBs).
