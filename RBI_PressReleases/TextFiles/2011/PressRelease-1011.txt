The Central Board of the Reserve Bank of India met today in Chennai. The 
meeting reviewed key economic, monetary and financial developments.  
Dr. D. Subbarao, Governor, Reserve Bank of India chaired the meeting.      
Shri Y. H. Malegam, Prof. U. R. Rao, Shri Lakshmi Chand, Shri H. P. Ranina,      
Smt. Shashi Rajagopalan, Shri Suresh Neotia, Dr. A. Vaidyanathan, Prof M. M. 
Sharma and Shri Sanjay Labroo were present at the meeting of the Central Board. 
Deputy Governors of the Reserve Bank, Dr. K.C. Chakrabarty, Dr. Subir Gokarn, 
Shri Anand Sinha and Shri H. R. Khan were also present.  
The Central Board of Directors of the Reserve Bank meets at least once every 
quarter. The Board has scheduled meetings in Mumbai, Chennai and Kolkata each 
year. The post-budget meeting of the Board, traditionally held in New Delhi, is 
addressed by the Union Finance Minister. The other meetings of the Board are held 
in the remaining state capitals by rotation. The main function of the Central Board of 
the Reserve Bank is to provide overall direction to its affairs.  
The Governor and the Top Management of the Reserve Bank met with State 
Government officials and bankers. The Governor appreciated the fact that Tamil 
Nadu has the highest Credit Deposit ratio in the country at 114%. The other issues 
which were discussed include routing of National Rural Employment Guarantee 
Scheme (NREGS) and Old Age Pension payments through bank accounts. The 
reasons for the low coverage of the crop insurance and measures of increasing 
lending to Micro Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) were also deliberated in 
detail.  
The Governor called on Dr. (Kum.) J  Jayalalithaa, the Chief Minister of Tamil 
Nadu, and apprised her of  the current macroeconomic situation and the growth-
inflation dynamics of  the country and of the efforts being made by the Reserve Bank 
of India to combat inflation.  To a query by the Chief Minister about what the State 
Government can do to ease the supply response, the Governor suggested that the 
Government could focus on rural infrastructure and providing market access to 
farmers.  The Chief Minister  solicited Reserve Bank's support for the State 
Government’s initiative in delivering pensions through bank accounts.  The Governor 
assured the Chief Minister that he will do so and in particular for launching the 
scheme in Trichy and Kanyakumari Districts on a pilot basis.  The Chief Minister and 
the RBI Governor also discussed the problems confronting the textile units and the 
Common Effluent Treatment Plants (CETPs) in Tirupur.  The Chief Minister said  that 
the State Government is deeply engaged in finding a sustainable solution to the 
problem in conformity with the High Court order.  The Governor invited the Chief 
Minister to attend and chair the State Level Bankers Committee Meeting (SLBC) and 
the Chief Minister responded enthusiastically to the invitation.
