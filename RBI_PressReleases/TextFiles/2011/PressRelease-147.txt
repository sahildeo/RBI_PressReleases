RBI Board meets at Kolkata; State Govt., Banks and  
RBI to work together for meaningful Financial Inclusion 
 The Central Board of Directors of the Reserve Bank of India met today at 
Kolkata. Dr. D. Subbarao, Governor, Reserve Bank of India chaired the meeting. 
Directors Sarva Shri Dr. Anil Kakodkar, Kiran Karnik, M.V.Rajeev Gowda, 
Y.H.Malegam,  Azim Premji, Dipankar Gupta,  G. M. Rao,  Ms. Ela Bhatt and            
Dr. Indira Rajaraman attended the meeting. The Government nominee,                  
Shri R.Gopalan, Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs also attended the 
meeting. Deputy Governors Dr. K.C.Chakrabarty, Dr. Subir Gokarn, Shri Anand 
Sinha and Shri H.R. Khan were also present. 
The Central Board meets at least once every quarter. Apart from holding 
meetings in Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata and one in New Delhi after the Union Budget 
which is addressed by the Finance Minister, the rest of the meetings are held in 
other state capitals by rotation. The main function of the Central Board of Directors of 
the Reserve Bank is to provide overall direction to the Reserve Bank’s affairs. 
Earlier, the Governor met the Chief Minister Miss Mamata Banerjee and 
discussed issues of mutual interest. The Governor also met local bankers and State 
Government officials.  At this meeting, the following decisions were taken:  
• Banks will endeavour to achieve credit deposit (CD) ratio of 65 per cent by the 
end of March 2012. Current CD ratio in the State was 62 per cent which was 
significantly lower than the national average of 74 per cent. A higher target for 
CD ratio to be achieved during 2012-13 would be reviewed after that but 
would largely be subject to demand for large corporate credit.  
• Banks will make efforts to cover at least one lakh Self-Help Groups (SHGs) by 
March 2012. There are total 1.55 lakh SHGs to be credit linked in the State, 
out of which 29,622 SHGs have already been covered by banks.  
• To get a clear picture of ground realities with regard to loans to be availed by 
General Credit Card holders, a team of officials of State government, banks 
and the Reserve Bank will conduct a survey in four districts of West Bengal – 
Murshidabad, Howrah, Malda and North 24-Parganas.  The survey would be 
completed by end-December 2011. Based on the findings of the survey, the 
SLBC will decide on the way forward.  
• All the 7486 villages with population of more than 2000, will be covered by 
banking facilities by March 2012 under the Financial Inclusion Plan. Banks 
had already covered 4348 villages by November 2011.

• State government will give all support to the Reserve Bank in extending 
electronic benefit transfer (EBT), to begin with, in four districts where pilot 
project had already been initiated. The objective, however, will be to extend 
EBT facility to all the districts in West Bengal covering all villages. Banks 
would need to work out modalities with the active support of State 
governments in this regard.   
• In order to give boost to credit in the State and to ensure district level 
participation, the Chief Minister has agreed to attend one State Level Bankers’ 
Committee (SLBC) meeting in the next three months.  
• To encourage credit enhancement and financial inclusion at the district level, 
the District Magistrate, Regional Managers of banks and officials of the 
Reserve Bank will attend the District Consultative Committee meetings.  
• The urgency of extending State contribution for recapitalisation of the three 
Regional Rural Banks (RRBs) in West Bengal necessary for their improved 
performance was reiterated.
