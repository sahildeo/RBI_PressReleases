RBI Statement on Recent Global Developments 
 
Developments relating to the US economy last week have significantly increased uncertainty 
about its prevailing condition. A sharp fall in US equity markets on Thursday was followed by a 
downgrade in the long-term US sovereign rating by rating agency Standard & Poor’s from AAA 
to AA+ with negative outlook on Friday. Two other rating agencies, Moody’s and Fitch, had 
recently maintained their AAA rating, but suggested that this could change.  The downgrade has 
raised concerns of continuing turmoil in global financial markets, as investors re-allocate 
portfolios in response to heightened risk perceptions stemming from both developments.  
 
As Friday’s market behaviour demonstrated, India is not insulated from such developments. It 
may, however, be noted that in the worst phase of the recent global financial crisis, the economy 
grew by 6.8 per cent, suggesting high resilience emerging from domestic factors. While 
downside risks to growth may have increased in the wake of global developments, they are 
likely to have limited impact. However, the policy and regulatory framework must anticipate 
and be prepared to respond to turbulent financial market conditions arising out of external 
developments.  
 
In the immediate future, the Reserve Bank’s priority is to ensure that adequate rupee and forex 
liquidity are maintained in domestic markets to prevent excessive volatility in interest rates and 
exchange rates. Rupee liquidity is being provided through the Repo window of the Liquidity 
Adjustment Facility (LAF). As of now, the banking system does not face any liquidity pressures 
as evident from the low level of dependence on liquidity injections under the LAF. In any case 
the banking system currently has an adequate stock of Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) 
securities, which are eligible for Repo transactions. Further, the capacity of the LAF to inject 
liquidity has recently been augmented by the introduction of the Marginal Standing Facility 
(MSF), which allows banks to draw down SLR securities up to a further one per cent of their 
Net Demand and Time Liabilities (NDTL) in order to meet liquidity requirements. This will help 
stabilize the call rate within the LAF corridor, which is currently 7-9 per cent. 
 
As regards forex liquidity, in anticipation of financial market turbulence related to the US debt 
ceiling impasse, the Reserve Bank made an assessment of the ability of the forex reserve 
portfolio to meet potential forex requirements in the event of significant capital outflows. This 
exercise indicated that there were sufficient liquid reserves to meet the demand for forex even in 
stress scenarios. 
 
The Reserve Bank is closely monitoring all key indicators and will continuously assess the 
impact of global developments on Rupee and forex liquidity and macroeconomic stability. We 
will respond quickly and appropriately to the evolving situation..
