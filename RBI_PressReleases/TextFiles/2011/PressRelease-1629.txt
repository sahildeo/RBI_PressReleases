Mid-Quarter Monetary Policy Review: March 2011 
 
Monetary Measures 
On the basis of the current macroeconomic assessment, it has been decided 
to: 
• increase the repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) by 25 
basis points from 6.5 per cent to 6.75 per cent with immediate effect; and 
• increase the reverse repo rate under the LAF by 25 basis points from 5.5 
per cent to 5.75 per cent with immediate effect. 
Global Economy 
The global scenario presents a mixed picture. While growth in emerging 
market economies (EMEs) remains strong, that in the US and the Euro area is clearly 
gaining momentum. However, the sharp increase in oil prices as a result of the turmoil 
in the Middle East and North Africa is adding uncertainty to the pace of global 
recovery. Further, coming on top of already elevated food and other commodity 
prices, the spike in oil prices has engendered inflation concerns.  
Inflationary pressures in EMEs are already high as output gaps have 
narrowed, while headline inflation has risen noticeably in a number of advanced 
economies, especially in the Euro area and the UK. Consequently, an increasing 
number of EMEs have begun monetary tightening, while the debate on exit from the 
accommodative monetary stance has come to the fore in the advanced economies. 
It is as yet too early to assess the macroeconomic consequences of the 
natural disaster in Japan. As normalcy is restored, expenditure on reconstruction may 
provide a boost to the economy. However, substitution of thermal for nuclear energy in 
Japan may exert further pressure on petroleum prices.   
Domestic Economy  
Growth 
Central Statistical Organisation’s recently released estimate of GDP growth of 
8.6 per cent for 2010-11 is consistent with the Reserve Bank’s projection set out in the 
Third Quarter Review. The area sown under the Rabi crop is higher than in last year 
which augurs well for agricultural production. Even as the index of industrial 
production (IIP) continues to be volatile, other indicators, such as the latest 
Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI), direct and indirect tax collections, merchandise 
exports and bank credit, suggest that the growth momentum persists. Lead indicators 
?null??????? 2
of services sector activity also remain robust. However, continuing uncertainty about 
energy and commodity prices may vitiate the investment climate, posing a threat to 
the current growth trajectory. In particular, the weak performance of capital goods in 
the IIP suggests that investment momentum may be slowing down. 
Inflation 
After a slight moderation in January, headline WPI inflation reversed in 
February 2011 accompanied by a sharp increase in non-food manufactured products 
inflation.   
As expected, the food article prices have declined substantially since January 
2011. However, the prices of protein sources such as milk and ‘eggs, meat and fish’ 
continued to remain high reflecting structural demand-supply imbalances. A number of 
measures contained in the Budget for 2011-12 to improve the agricultural supply 
response in the medium-term will aid in redressing these imbalances. Fuel prices 
remain high, reflecting the global trend, with potential for further rise. Significantly, 
non-food manufactured products inflation, an indicator of demand side pressure, rose 
sharply from 4.8 per cent in January to 6.1 per cent in February and continues to stay 
well above its medium-term trend. The acceleration was spread across manufacturing 
activities, indicating that producers are able to pass on higher input prices to 
consumers. 
In its Third Quarter Review, the Reserve Bank had projected year-on-year 
WPI inflation for March 2011 at 7 per cent.  However, further upside risks have 
stemmed from high international crude prices, their impact on freely priced petroleum 
products, the increase in administered coal prices and pick-up in non-food 
manufactured product prices.  The March 2011 WPI inflation is now estimated to be 
higher - around 8 per cent. 
Fiscal Deficit 
While the budgeted level of fiscal deficit for 2011-12 gives some comfort on 
the demand front, a potential increase in the subsidies on petroleum products and 
fertilizers as a result of high crude prices could put pressure on expenditure. It is 
critical, therefore, to focus on the quality of expenditure, keeping the aggregate under 
control without compromising on the delivery of services. Only by doing this can the 
fiscal situation contribute to demand-side inflation management. 
Current Account 
The Reserve Bank had expressed concern about the widening of the current 
account deficit (CAD) and the nature of its financing in its Third Quarter Review.  
Going by the recent robust export performance, CAD for 2010-11 is now estimated to 
come lower than earlier expected, at around 2.5 per cent of GDP. While the CAD this 
year has been financed comfortably, it is necessary to focus on the quality of capital 
inflows with greater emphasis on attracting long-term components, including foreign 
direct investment (FDI), so as to enhance the sustainability of the balance of 
payments (BoP) over the medium-term.  
Credit Conditions  
While the year-on-year non-food credit growth at 23 per cent in February 
remains above the indicative projection of 20 per cent, the pace of credit expansion 
has moderated since December 2010. Monetary transmission is increasingly visible 
as banks continue to raise their lending rates.   3
Liquidity  
Net liquidity injection through LAF declined from an average of around ` 
93,000 crore in January to `79,000 crore in February 2011, and further to `68,000 
crore in March (up to March 16) due mainly to increase in government spending and 
consequent decline in government cash balances with the Reserve Bank. Going 
forward, the overall liquidity situation is expected to move close to the comfort level of 
the Reserve Bank  (+/- 1 per cent of net demand and time liabilities of banks) although 
it is likely to come under some temporary pressure in the second half of March due to 
advance tax collections. 
Summing Up 
To sum up, the underlying inflationary pressures have accentuated, even as 
risks to growth are emerging.  Rising global commodity prices, particularly oil, are a 
major contributor to both developments.  As domestic fuel prices are yet to adjust fully 
to global prices, risks to inflation remain clearly on the upside, reinforced by the 
persistence of demand-side pressures as reflected in non-food manufacturing 
inflation. The Union Budget for 2011-12 indicates some easing of demand pressures 
from the fiscal side, thus creating space for private investment, but this will materialise 
only if commitments to contain subsidies are adhered to. Measures to increase 
agricultural productivity, particularly in items facing structural supply-demand 
imbalances, will contribute to easing food inflation over time.     
Expected Outcomes 
The policy action in this Review is expected to: 
• continue to rein in demand-side inflationary pressures while minimising risks 
to growth; and 
• manage inflationary expectations and contain the spillover of food and 
commodity prices into more generalised inflation. 
Guidance 
Based on the current and evolving growth and inflation scenario, the Reserve 
Bank is likely to persist with the current anti-inflationary stance.
