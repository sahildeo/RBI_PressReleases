Results of 16 Round (Q1:2011-12)  
of Survey of Professional Forecasters on Macroeconomic Indicators  
The Reserve Bank of India today released on its website the results of 
quarterly Survey of Professional Forecasters on major macroeconomic indicators of 
short to medium term economic developments. The survey round relates to the first 
quarter of 2011-12, that is, April-June 2011.  
Done through a questionnaire responded by 30 forecasters who participated 
in this round, the survey covered component-wise detailed forecasts of GDP growth, 
inflation, savings, capital formation, consumption expenditure, export, import, interest 
rates, money supply, credit growth, stock market movements, corporate profit, etc.  
The Reserve Bank has been conducting this survey on a quarterly basis from 
the second quarter ended September 2007. It disseminates the survey results 
through its website on a regular basis.  
Salient Features 
1. Annual Forecasts:   
Real GDP for 2011-12: 
• For 2011-12, forecasters have revised their real GDP growth rate projections 
1
downwards to 7.9 per cent from 8.2 per cent in last survey. Projections for 
agriculture, industry and services growth are 3.5 per cent, 7.4 per cent and 
9.0 per cent respectively.  For agriculture, there is an upward revision and for 
Industry and services, there is a downward revision from the previous round. 
The forecasters were asked to assign probabilities to the possibility that year-
on-year real GDP growth rate will fall into various ranges. For 2011-12, they 
have assigned maximum probability of 39.9 per cent to 7.5-7.9 per cent 
growth range for GDP. The chart given below shows mean probability pattern 
of real GDP growth projections.
