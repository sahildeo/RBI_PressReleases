Highlights: 
1. India's Foreign Trade: 2011-12 (April-September) 
The article reviews India’s merchandise trade performance during 2011-12 
(April-September) on the basis of data released by the Directorate General of 
Commercial Intelligence and Statistics (DGCI&S). It also analyses disaggregated 
commodity-wise and direction-wise details for the period 2011-12 (April-June). 
Main Findings 
• During 2011-12 (April-September), exports stood at US$ 160 billion and 
recorded a growth of 52.1 per cent as compared with an increase of 30.0 per 
cent during the corresponding period of the previous year. 
• During 2011-12 (April-September), imports at US$ 233.5 billion registered a 
growth of 32.4 per cent as compared with 37.6 per cent in the preceding year.   
There has been significant rise in import of gold and silver and machinery. 
• Petroleum, oil and lubricants (POL) imports at US$ 70.4 billion in 2011-12 
(April-September) exhibited a higher growth of 42.0 per cent, reflecting 
increase in international crude oil prices, as compared 31.8 per cent a year 
ago.  
• Non-oil imports during 2011-12 (April-September) at US$ 163.1 billion 
recorded a growth of 28.5 per cent as compared to 40.0 per cent in the 
corresponding period of the preceding year.  
• Trade deficit during 2011-12 (April-September) amounted to US$ 73.5 billion, 
as compared with US$ 71.2 billion during April-September 2010.  
• The disaggregated data on commodity-wise merchandise exports indicate 
that during 2011-12 (April-June), engineering goods, petroleum products, 
chemicals, gems & jewellery and agricultural products contributed more than 
80 per cent of exports. Export growth was higher in sectors, viz., leather & 
manufactures and textile & textile products while the same was lower for 
petroleum products and ores & minerals.

• There has been diversification of merchandise exports towards developing 
countries with their share in total exports increasing to 43.6 per cent during 
April-June 2011-12 from 41.7 per cent during April-June 2010. 
2. Central Government Finances 2011-12 (April-September) 
The article reviews the finances of the Central government during the first half 
of 2011-12, based on the data released by the Controller General of Accounts on 
October 31, 2011. It provides the details of receipts and expenditures of the Central 
government during the period under review. 
Main Findings 
• Central government finances for the first half (April-September) of 2011-12 
show that it would be challenging to anchor the key deficit indicators within the 
budget estimates for 2011-12. 
• The key deficit indicators, viz., gross fiscal deficit, revenue deficit and primary 
deficit, of the Centre, as proportion of budget estimates, were much higher in 
the first half of the current fiscal year even after adjusting for higher than the 
budgeted spectrum receipts during the first half of 2010-11. 
• Tax revenue growth remained far below the budgeted growth, reflecting not 
only a significant amount of direct tax refunds but also slowdown in indirect 
tax revenues during the current financial year. Moderation in economic growth 
and changes in customs/excise duty rates on petroleum products in June 
2011 may have also impacted the tax revenues. 
• While the expenditure growth of the Centre during April-September 2011 
remained lower than a year ago, it overshot the budgeted growth primarily on 
account of higher non-plan expenditure. This indicates strong upside 
pressures in respect of subsidies, which when accounted for in Central 
finances, pose the risk of fiscal slippages during 2011-12.   
• The Centre has revised upwards the market borrowings through dated 
securities by ` 52,872 crore for the second half of 2011-12, thereby raising the 
gross market borrowings for 2011-12 by 12.7 per cent above the budgeted 
amount (` 469,738 crore).  
• While there could be a fiscal slippage during 2011-12, it would be imperative 
to return to the medium-term path of fiscal consolidation through timely 
implementation of tax reforms (Direct Tax Code, Goods and Services Tax), 
expenditure reform measures and linking the expenditure related 
announcements to tax/revenue enhancing initiatives.  
3. Inflation Expectations Survey of Households: September 2011 (Round 25) 
          The findings of Inflation Expectations Survey of Households conducted in the 
th
July-September 2011 quarter, the 25 round in the series is presented here. The 
survey captures the inflation expectations of 4,000 urban households across 12 
cities for the next three-month and for the next one-year.  
         
 These expectations are based on their individual consumption baskets and, 
hence, should not be considered as predictors of any official measure of inflation. 
The households’ inflation expectations provide useful directional information on near-
term inflationary pressures and also supplement other economic indicators to get a 
better indication of future inflation. The survey results are those of the respondents 
and not necessarily shared by the Reserve Bank of India.

Main Findings 
 
• The current round of the survey shows that the percentage of respondents 
expecting price rise have gone down for all product groups (viz., food, non-
food, households durables, housing and services) except three-month price of 
housing. 
• Expectations on general price rise were mainly influenced by movements in 
food prices. The three-months ahead inflation expectations of households 
have moved higher at 12.2 per cent from 11.8 per cent in the last round of 
survey but one-year ahead inflation expectations has remained same at 12.9 
per cent. 
• The survey findings indicate that households expect inflation to rise further by 
50 and 120 basis points during next three-month and next one-year, 
respectively, from the perceived current rate of 11.7 per cent.  
• On category-wise inflation expectations, daily-wage workers and housewives 
expected higher inflation rates compared to other categories. 
•  Across the cities, Jaipur expected the highest inflation while expectations 
were the lowest for Kolkata.  
• 27 per cent of the respondents felt that the Reserve Bank is taking necessary 
action to control inflation, of which, 58 per cent felt that the Reserve Bank’s 
action has an impact on controlling inflation. 
4.  Quarterly Industrial Outlook Survey: July-September 2011 (Round 55) 
This article presents the findings of Industrial Outlook Survey conducted for 
th
the July-September 2011 quarter, 55 round in the series. It gives an assessment of 
business situation of companies in manufacturing sector, for the quarter July-
September 2011, and their expectations for the ensuing quarter October-December 
2011. 
Main Findings
• The survey results showed further decline of business conditions in the Indian 
manufacturing sector for assessment quarter as well as expectation quarter.  
• The Business Expectation Index, a measure that gives a single snapshot of 
the industrial outlook in each study quarter, dropped to 109.4 from 116.3 for 
assessment quarter and to 118.8 from 121.5 for expectation quarter; however, 
it still remains well above 100, the threshold that separates contraction from 
expansion. 
5.  Quarterly Order Books, Inventories and Capacity Utilisation Survey: April-
June 2011 (Round 14) 
th
This article, first in the series, presents the survey findings of the 14 round of 
the Order Books, Inventories and Capacity Utilisation Survey. The survey was 
conducted for the April-June 2011 quarter (Q1:2011-12) and captures the quarterly 
movements in order books, inventories and capacity utilisation of a targeted group of 
manufacturing companies, which are important indicators of economic activities, 
inflationary pressures and overall business cycle and as such, are useful in 
assessing the consumption and investment demand outlook.

Main Findings
• During Q1:2011-12, the new orders of respondent companies dropped 
significantly by 13.8 per cent as compared to previous quarter. This is 
reflected in lowering of capacity utilisation rate to 72.3 per cent in Q1 of 2011-
12 from 77.8 per cent in Q4 of 2010-11, that could be partly due to seasonal 
factors. There has also been an increase in finished goods inventories. 
6. Consumer Confidence Survey: September 2011 
This article presents the salient findings of the Consumer Confidence Survey 
conducted in September 2011, the 6th round in the series. The survey covers 5,400 
households well spread in six metro cities. The survey captures the household’s 
confidence in the current and expected economic conditions, household 
circumstances, employment conditions, current and future spending and prices 
based on their perceptions of the general economic and own financial situation.  The 
survey results are those of the respondents and are not necessarily the perceptions 
of Reserve Bank of India. 
 
Main Findings 
 
• The survey indicates a decline in the positive perceptions of the current 
economic conditions. Though more than half of the respondents felt that their 
household circumstances have become better off as compared with a year 
ago, this proportion has declined in September 2011 as compared with June 
2011. 
• Optimism regarding an increase in future income, though high, has been 
sliding over the last four quarters. 
• The degree of negative perceptions on price levels for current and future are 
down marginally in September 2011 as compared with June 2011. However, 
about 85 per cent of the respondents felt that prices would continue to 
increase during the next year.  
• Overall the Current Situation Index as well as the Future Expectations Index is 
estimated to be marginally lower in September 2011 as compared with June 
2011.
