Computation and Dissemination of RBI Reference Rate – Revised Methodology 
 
The Reserve Bank of India compiles and publishes on a daily basis reference 
rates for Spot USD-INR and Spot EUR-INR. Under the existing methodology, the 
rates are arrived at by averaging the mean of the bid/ offer rates polled from a few 
select banks around 12 noon every week-day (excluding Saturdays). The 
contributing banks are selected on the basis of their standing, market-share in the 
domestic foreign exchange market and representative character. The Reserve Bank 
periodically reviews the procedure for selecting the banks and the methodology of 
polling so as to ensure that the reference rate is a true reflection of the market 
activity.  Accordingly, it has been decided to revise the existing methodology, the 
details of which are as under: 
   
• The rates will be polled from the select list of contributing banks at a randomly 
chosen five minute window between 10.30 a.m. and 12.30 p.m. every week-
day (excluding Saturdays).   
 
• The reference rates for spot US Dollar and Euro against Rupee shall be 
disseminated up to the fourth decimal place.  
 
• The daily press release on RBI Reference Rate for US Dollar and Euro will be 
issued every week-day (excluding Saturdays) at 1.00 p.m. 
 
These changes shall be effective from July 1, 2011.
