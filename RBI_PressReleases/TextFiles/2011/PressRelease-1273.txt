RBI Central Board meets Today at Agartala;  
Governor meets State Government and Bankers  
The Central Board of Directors of the Reserve Bank of India met today at 
Agartala. Dr. D. Subbarao, Governor, Reserve Bank of India chaired the meeting. 
The Central Board members present in the meeting were: Shri Y. H. Malegam,     
Prof U.R. Rao, Shri Lakshmi Chand, Shri H.P. Ranina, Dr. A. Vaidyanathan,          
Dr. M. M. Sharma, Shri Sanjay Labroo and Smt. Shashi Rajagopalan as also Deputy 
Governors of the Reserve Bank Smt. Shyamala Gopinath, Dr. K.C. Chakrabarty,    
Dr. Subir Gokarn and Shri Anand Sinha. The meeting reviewed key economic, 
monetary and financial developments in the country. 
The Central Board meets at least once every quarter. Apart from holding 
meetings in Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata and one in New Delhi after the Union Budget 
and addressed by the Finance Minister - the rest of the meetings are held in other 
state capitals by rotation. The main function of the Central Board of Directors of the 
Reserve Bank is to provide overall direction to the Reserve Bank’s affairs. 
The Reserve Bank opened a sub-office in Agartala on the eve of its Board 
meeting. Shri Manik Sarkar, Hon’ble Chief Minister of Tripura inaugurated the sub- 
office along with Reserve Bank Governor Dr. D. Subbarao. Shri Badal Chaudhary, 
Hon’ble Finance Minister of Tripura and senior officers of the state, banks and RBI 
were present. While opening the new office of the Reserve Bank of India in Agartala, 
the Chief Minister stated that the State government had been and would cooperate 
in every manner to ensure that banking access is made available to the people in the 
State. He, however, lamented at the low credit/deposit ratio of banks, low credit flow 
to agriculture, low number of bank branches and inadequate manpower in these 
branches in the State. 
The Governor in his remarks pointed out that the Reserve Bank was sensitive 
to all the three issues and was taking appropriate steps to bring improvement in all 
the three areas. It had already decided to open its offices in all the North-Eastern 
States, he said and added that opening of an office in Agartala was a step in that 
direction. The Reserve Bank was also making efforts to enhance credit flow to the 
North-Eastern States. In the past few years, for instance, the Reserve Bank of India 
had announced a subvention scheme for opening branches in the North-East. Of the 
five branches which were agreed to be opened in Tripura, two branches were 
already opened and three more had been approved and would be opened as soon 
as security issues were resolved. He hoped that the issue would be resolved soon 
with the cooperation of the State government.

The Governor pointed out that for faster development of the region, it was 
equally important to increase its credit absorptive capacity. For this purpose, it was 
equally necessary to introduce bankable schemes and open financial literacy and 
credit counselling centres in the region. He added that educating the population 
about banking facilities would also help generate demand for bank services and 
products. He urged the State Government to include finance in school curriculum to 
enhance financial literacy in the state. He stated that the Reserve Bank had 
developed  material for this purpose which it would willingly share with the State 
government.  
Earlier, Dr. D. Subbarao, inaugurated the Electronic Clearing System 
(ECS) by putting through the first transaction at the Clearing House maintained by 
State Bank of India, Agartala. ECS is an efficient, secure and fast payment system 
that enables quick movement of payments and receipts and is especially beneficial 
for bulk payments like salary, pension, Government benefit payments like NREGA 
and utility payments. Shri A. Krishna Kumar, Managing Director, State Bank of India 
was present at the launch.  
At the special State Level Bankers Committee (SLBC) meeting held today, the 
following decisions were taken: 
• banks will strive to achieve 40 per cent credit deposit ratio during the current 
financial year; 
• to improve access to banking services in the North-East, banks will open at 
least 26 (of the over 400 branches to be opened) in brick and mortar form; 
• banks will organise a Financial Literacy Day before March 2012 to enhance 
financial literacy and awareness among the people of the state; and 
• the progress of these action points would be reviewed before October 2011.
