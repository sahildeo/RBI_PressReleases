RBI announces rate of interest on Floating Rate Bonds, 2012 
The rate of interest on the Floating Rate Bonds, 2012 (FRB, 2012) applicable 
for the year (November 10, 2011 to November 9, 2012) shall be 8.71 per cent per 
annum. 
It may be recalled that the rate of interest on the FRB, 2012 was set at a 
mark-up (as decided in the auction held on November 07, 2003) over and above the 
variable base rate. The variable base rate for payment of interest shall be the 
average rate (rounded off up to two decimal places) of the implicit yields at cut-off 
prices of the last three auctions of Government of India 364-day Treasury Bills held 
up to the commencement of the respective annual coupon period which worked out 
to be 8.62 per cent. The mark-up decided in the auction held on November 07, 2003 
was (+) 0.09 per cent (plus 09 basis points). The coupon rate has thus been fixed at 
8.71 per cent.
