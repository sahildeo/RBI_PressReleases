RBI Study Papers look at Linkages between Banking and  
Economic Development of States 
Banking presence positively impacts the States’ Net States Domestic Product 
(NSDP) and thus does contribute to the economic development of States. This was 
revealed in a paper titled ‘Banking Penetration and Growth Dynamics at State Level’ 
prepared by Raj Rajesh, Smita Sharma, Naveen Kumar, Monika Kathuria and John 
V. Guria, all economists in the Reserve Bank of India.  The study found evidence of 
linkages between the parameters of banking sector and economic development 
across the Indian states. Using a Banking Services Outreach Index (BSOI) for the 
period 1980-81 to 2009-10, it found that there was a wide divergence in banking 
outreach across the States. It also found that there was no substantial change in 
relative position of the States in terms of banking outreach in the last decade. 
Further, the paper found evidence that improvement in per capita income, road 
connectivity and electrification contribute in fostering banking outreach across the 
Indian States.  
Another paper titled ‘Regional Competitiveness: Drivers and Potential 
Constraints’ by Sadhan Kumar Chattopadhyay, P. Brijesh, Vineet Srivastava, and 
Rajiv Lochan, also economists in the Reserve Bank, examined the competitiveness 
of States of India by calculating competitiveness indices for 16 major States of the 
country using principal component analysis. The results show that Delhi, Tamil 
Nadu, Maharashtra and Gujarat top the list of competitiveness and Bihar is at the 
bottom. The results of competitiveness index correlate better with the total factor 
productivity growth obtained by Production Function Approach. The study also 
examines the trade openness of the States as it has a direct link with 
competitiveness. It observes that the rank correlation coefficient between 
competitiveness and openness is statistically insignificant. However, in respect of 
openness, Punjab, Delhi and Rajasthan were found to be at the top, while 
Maharashtra, being one of the most industrialised States was found to be at the 
bottom.  Moreover, most of the industrialised States are found to be import-
competing and not export-competing.  Overall, a State has a crucial role to play in 
achieving higher productivity, efficiency and export growth. In fact, the competitive 
processes have to be coordinated by the States as market forces may not be able to 
achieve proper coordination. On the export front, appropriate policies need to be 
framed by the Central Government in order to make them internationally competitive.  
In their paper ‘Regional Dimensions of Informal Finance in India: Issues and 
Implications,’ the Reserve Bank economists K. Jayanthi Anand, A. K. Shukla,           
V. Dhanya and T. P. Meite attempted to trace the changes, if any, in the mode of 
??????????2 
 
informal channels in recent years. Apart from analysing secondary data, the 
economists prepared case studies on Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Kerala and Manipur. The 
case studies highlighted region specific attributes of informal finance. Results of 
econometric tests showed that in rural areas coefficient of formal debt was positive 
whereas coefficient of asset size was insignificant. In sum, the analysis shows that 
both formal and informal finance coexist in the economy and so long as the formal 
channel is unable to cover the changing demands from the consumer, informal 
finance will continue to persist in the economy. Nevertheless, better coverage of 
formal finance offers choice to the consumers thereby reducing the chances of 
usurious interest rates by the informal sources. Further, Self Help Groups have, to a 
great extent, reduced the recourse to money lenders in Kerala, Tamil Nadu and 
Gujarat. 
These papers were presented at a conference of economists of the Reserve 
Bank of India held last week. The conference, which is held every year, was 
inaugurated by Dr. Subir Gokarn, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank. The 2011 
conference theme focussed on three inter-related issues through three papers 
presented by three groups of Reserve Bank economists in a technical session led by 
one expert and three panelists presenting their views on the themes. Shri Siva 
Kumar, Managing Director, State Bank of Bikaner and Jaipur, Prof. R.Nagaraj and 
Prof. K.V. Ramaswamy, both, Professors at  the Indira Gandhi Institute of 
Development Research were invited as experts to the conference. Other panelists 
comprised heads of some RBI departments and regional offices.  
The papers will be modified on the basis of comments given by experts and 
panelists and will be published in due course under the Working Paper Series of the 
Reserve Bank of India.
