RBI revises Internal Control Guidelines for Forex Business 
The Reserve Bank of India has today issued the revised Guidelines for 
“Internal Control over Foreign Exchange Business”. 
First framed in 1981, the Internal Control Guidelines (ICG) were revised in 
December, 1996. The need to revise them once again was felt in the context of rapid 
pace of evolution of the forex markets in India and abroad as also, developments in 
information technology and its progressive usage in banks. A Group comprising 
officials from the Reserve Bank of India, Foreign Exchange Dealers’ Association of 
India, Fixed Income Money Market and Derivatives Association of India, State Bank 
of India, ICICI Bank and Standard Chartered Bank looked into the updation of the 
Internal Control Guidelines to make them contemporary and benchmark document.  
The document is designed to provide a scale of standards for the banks in the 
conduct of their foreign exchange business and is available on our website 
(www.rbi.org.in).
