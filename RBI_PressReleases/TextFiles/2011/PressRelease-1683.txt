RBI sets up Working Group to examine Issues relating to NBFC Sector 
 
The Reserve Bank of India has constituted a Working Group under the 
Chairmanship of Smt. Usha Thorat, Director, Centre for Advanced Financial 
Research and Learning (CAFRAL) to examine a range of emerging issues pertaining 
to regulation of the NBFC (non-banking financial companies) sector. 
 
The NBFC sector in India has undergone a significant transformation in the 
past few years and has come to be recognised as a systemically important element 
of the financial system. The recent global financial crisis has also highlighted the 
regulatory imperatives concerning the non-banking financial sector and the risks 
arising from regulatory gaps, arbitrage and systemic inter-connectedness. A need 
was, therefore, felt to reflect on the broad principles that underpin the regulatory 
architecture for NBFCs keeping in view the economic role and heterogeneity of this 
sector and the recent international experience.  
 
Other members of the Group are Shri Sanjay Labroo, Director, Central 
Board, Reserve Bank of India, Shri Rajiv Lall, Managing Director and Chief 
Executive Officer, Infrastructure Development Finance Corporation,                      
Shri Bharat Doshi, Executive Director and Group Chief Financial Officer, Mahindra & 
Mahindra and Shri Pratip Kar, Director, Globsyn Business School, Kolkata.           
Ms. Uma Subramaniam, Chief General Manager-in-Charge, Department of Non-
Banking Supervision will be the Member-Secretary. 
 
While examining a range of emerging issues pertaining to the regulation of the 
sector, the Working Group will focus on the definition and classification of NBFCs, 
addressing regulatory gaps and regulatory arbitrage, maintaining standards of 
governance in the sector and appropriate approach to NBFC supervision. The scope 
of examination will, however, be within the current legislative framework.
