RBI launches Quarterly Industrial Outlook Survey for July-September 2011 
 The Reserve Bank of India has launched the 55th round of the Industrial 
Outlook Survey (IOS) for reference period July – September 2011. M/s Centre for 
Research Planning and Action, New Delhi has been mandated to conduct the survey 
for this quarter on behalf of the Reserve Bank of India. Manufacturing companies will 
be approached by this agency during the quarter. Other manufacturing companies 
which are not approached by the agency can also participate in this survey by 
downloading the survey schedule from the Reserve Bank’s website (www.rbi.org.in). 
The survey schedule is placed under Forms >> Survey. The duly authenticated filled-
in survey schedule may be e-mailed or fax as per contact details given in the survey 
schedule. 
 The Reserve Bank has been conducting the Industrial Outlook Survey on a 
quarterly basis since 1998. The survey covers non-financial private and public limited 
companies with a good size/industry representation. The survey gives an insight into 
the perception of public and private limited companies engaged in manufacturing 
activities about their own performance and prospects. The assessment of business 
sentiments for the current quarter and expectations for the ensuing quarter are 
based on qualitative responses to 20 major parameters covering overall business 
situation, financial situation, demand indicators, price and employment expectations, 
profit margins, etc. The survey provides useful forward looking inputs to 
policymakers, analysts and business alike. 
 The salient features of this survey results at the aggregate level are published 
in Monthly RBI Bulletin of the Reserve Bank. The article on 53rd round of the survey 
was published in June 2011 issue of the RBI Bulletin under the title “Quarterly 
Industrial Outlook Survey: January-March 2011 (53rd Round).
