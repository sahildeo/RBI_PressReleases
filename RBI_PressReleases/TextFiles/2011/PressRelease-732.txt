RBI releases Report of the Working Group on the 
Issues and Concerns in the NBFC Sector 
 
The Reserve Bank of India today placed on its website the Report of the Working Group 
on the Issues and Concerns in the NBFC Sector, chaired by Smt. Usha Thorat, Director, 
Centre for Advanced Financial Research and Learning (CAFRAL). Other members of 
the Group were Sanjay Labroo, Rajiv Lall, Bharat Doshi, Pratip Kar and Uma 
Subramaniam (Member secretary). Comments on the Report may please be emailed or 
forwarded by end-September 2011 to the Chief General Manager-in-Charge, 
Department of Non-Banking Supervision, Reserve Bank of India, Central Office, WTC, 
Cuffe Parade, Mumbai 400 005. 
It may be recalled that the Working Group was constituted to review the existing 
regulatory and supervisory framework of non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) with 
special focus on the risks in the sector. The Working Group was also to recommend 
appropriate regulatory and supervisory measures to address these risks, with the aim of 
creating a strong and resilient financial sector, vital for all round economic growth of the 
country. 
The basic considerations underlying the approach of the Working Group were:  
(i) recognition that registration as NBFC with RBI provides comfort to lenders 
and investors and enables leveraging of public funds;  
?null???????(ii) simplification and rationalization of the scope of regulation and registration so 
as to focus on risk based regulation of non deposit taking entities, as risk on 
account of deposit taking entities had been largely dealt with earlier;  
(iii) retaining the innovative nature of NBFCs engaged in productive sectors while 
placing buffers to cushion risk on account of (a) concentration and funding 
pattern inherent in the business model and (b) exposure to sensitive sectors;  
(iv) dealing with regulatory arbitrage while not recommending completely bank like 
policies and regulation for NBFCs; and  
(v) strengthening governance, disclosure and supervision to ensure that the 
changes recommended cause minimum disruption to NBFCs, adequate 
transition time for compliance to the recommendations has been provided, 
except where expressly specified.    
Key recommendations of the Working Group are: 
 
1. The minimum net owned fund (NOF) requirement for all new NBFCs wanting to 
register with the Reserve Bank could be retained at the present Rs. 2 crore till 
the Reserve Bank of India Act is amended. The Reserve Bank of India should, 
however, insist on a minimum asset size of more than Rs. 50 crore for registering 
any new NBFC. Existing NBFCs below this limit may deregister or be asked to 
seek a fresh certificate of registration at the end of two years;  
2. NBFCs not accessing public funds may be exempted from registration provided 
their assets are below Rs. 1000 crore;   
3. Any transfer of shareholding, direct or indirect, of 25 per cent and above, change 
in control, merger or acquisition of any registered NBFC should have prior 
approval of the Reserve Bank; 
4. The twin-criterion of assets and income for determining the principal business of 
an NBFC should be increased to 75 per cent of the total asset and 75 per cent of 
the total income, respectively. A time period of three years may be given to fulfil 
revised principal business criteria;  5. Tier I capital for Capital to Risk Weighted Assets Ratio (CRAR) purposes may be 
specified at 12 per cent to be achieved in three years for all registered deposit 
taking and non-deposit taking NBFCs; 
6. Liquidity ratio may be introduced for all registered NBFCs such that cash, bank 
balances and holdings of government securities fully cover the gaps, if any, 
between cumulative outflows and cumulative inflows for the first 30 days;   
7. Asset classification and provisioning norms similar to banks to be brought in 
phased manner for NBFCs. Suitable income tax deduction akin to banks may be 
allowed for provisions made under the regulations. Accounting norms applicable 
to banks may be applied to NBFCs;  
8. NBFCs may be subject to regulations similar to banks while lending to stock 
brokers and merchant banks and similar to stock brokers, as specified by the 
Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), while undertaking margin 
financing; 
9. Financial conglomerate approach may be adopted for supervision of larger 
NBFCs that have stock brokers and merchant bankers in the group; 
10. Government owned entities that qualify as NBFCs may comply with the 
regulatory framework applicable to NBFCs at the earliest.  
11. Board approved limits for bank’s exposure to real estate may be made applicable 
for the bank group as a whole, where there is an NBFC in the group. The risk 
weights for NBFCs that are not sponsored by banks or that do not have any bank 
as part of the group may be raised to 150 per cent for capital market exposures 
and 125 per cent for Commercial Real Estate (CRE) exposures. In case  of bank 
sponsored NBFCs, the risk weights for Capital Market Exposures (CME) and 
CRE may be the same as specified for banks; 
12. NBFCs may be given the benefit under Securitisation and Reconstruction of 
Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest (SARFAESI) Act, 2002;   
13.  Captive NBFCs, the business models of which focus mainly (90 per cent and 
above) on financing parent company’s products, may maintain Tier I capital at 12 
per cent from the time of registration. Supervisory risk assessment of such 
companies should take into account the risk of the parent company;  14.  For the purpose of applicability of registration and supervision, the total assets of 
all NBFCs in a group should be taken together to determine the cut off limit of Rs. 
100 crore; 
 
15.  All NBFCs with assets of Rs.1000 crore and above, whether listed or not, should 
be required to comply with Clause 49 of SEBI Listing Agreements including 
mandatory disclosures;  
16.  Disclosure for NBFCs with assets over Rs 100 crore may include provision 
coverage ratio, liquidity ratio, asset liability profile, extent of financing of parent 
company products, mo vement of non-performing assets (NPAs), off-balance 
sheet exposures, structured products and securitisations/assignments. 
17.  NBFCs with assets of Rs. 1000 crore and above should be inspected 
comprehensively on an annual basis with an annual stress test carried out to 
ascertain their vulnerability.
