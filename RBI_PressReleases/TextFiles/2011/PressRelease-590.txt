Broad parameters for banks and NBFCs  
to set up Infrastructure Debt Funds (IDFs) 
The Reserve Bank has announced today that banks and Non Banking 
Financial Companies (NBFCs) would be eligible to sponsor Infrastructure Debt 
Funds (IDFs), to be set up as Mutual Funds (MFs) and NBFCs.  The Securities and 
Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has amended the (Mutual Funds) Regulations to 
provide regulatory framework for IDF-MFs by inserting Chapter VI – B to the MF 
Regulations. 
The broad parameters for setting up of IDFs under MF and NBFC structures 
by banks and NBFCs are given below:  
I.   Parameters for setting up of IDFs as MFs by banks and NBFCs 
Banks and NBFCs would be eligible to sponsor  (as defined by SEBI 
Regulations for Mutual Funds) IDFs as Mutual Funds with prior approval of RBI 
subject to the following conditions in addition to those prescribed by SEBI: 
Banks as sponsors 
• Banks acting as sponsors to IDF-MFs would be subject to existing prudential 
limits including limits on investments in financial services companies and 
limits on capital market exposure. 
NBFCs as sponsors 
A NBFC sponsoring IDF-Mutual Fund will have to fulfill the following eligibility 
criteria: 
• It should have a minimum Net Owned Funds (NOF)  of Rs. 300 crore and 
CRAR of 15%; 
• Its net NPAs should be less than 3% of net advances; 
• It should have been in existence for at least 5 years and should be earning 
profits for the last three years and its performance should be satisfactory; 
• The CRAR of the NBFC post investment in the IDF-MF should not be less 
than that prescribed; and 
• The NBFC should continue to maintain the required level of NOF after 
accounting for investment in the proposed IDF. 
II. Parameters for setting up IDF – NBFC by banks and NBFCs 
Sponsors of NBFC- IDFs will have to contribute a minimum equity of 30% and 
a maximum equity of 49% of the IDF-NBFC. Banks and NBFC-Infrastructure Finance 
Company (NBFC-IFCs) may sponsor IDFs as NBFCs with prior approval by RBI 
subject to the following conditions:

Banks as sponsors  
• Banks acting as sponsors to IDF-NBFCs would be subject to existing 
prudential limits including limits on investments in financial services 
companies and limits on capital market exposure. 
NBFC-IFC as sponsor 
• Post investment in the IDF, the sponsor must maintain minimum CRAR and 
NOF prescribed for IFCs. 
Criteria for IDF-NBFC 
i)  The IDF must have NOF of Rs. 300 crore or above;  
ii)  The IDF should be assigned a minimum credit rating 'A' or equivalent of 
CRISIL, FITCH, CARE, ICRA or equivalent rating by any other accredited 
rating agencies;  
iii)  Tier II capital cannot exceed Tier I. Minimum CRAR should be 15% of risk 
weighted assets;  
iv) The IDF shall invest only in PPP and post COD infrastructure projects which 
have completed at least one year of satisfactory commercial operation and 
are a party to a Tripartite Agreement with the concessionaire and the Project 
Authority for ensuring a compulsory buyout with termination payment; 
v) For the purpose of computing capital adequacy of the IDF, bonds covering 
PPP and post COD projects in existence over a year of commercial operation 
shall be assigned a risk weight of 50%; 
vi) The exposure norms for IDF –NBFC will be linked to its total capital funds 
(Tier I and Tier II).  
The maximum exposure that an IDF can take to a borrower or a group of 
borrowers will be at 50% of its total capital funds. Additional exposure up to 10% 
would be allowed at the discretion of the Board of the IDF-NBFC. Boards of IDFs will 
be required to frame appropriate policies governing risk, exposure etc. Limited 
additional exposure over 60% could be taken with RBI’s prior approval. 
Detailed guidelines for setting up IDFs banks and NBFCs would be issued 
separately. 
Background 
It may be recalled that the Union Finance Minister in his budget speech for 
2011-12 had announced setting up of IDFs in order to accelerate and enhance the 
flow of long term debt in infrastructure projects for funding the Government’s 
ambitious programme of infrastructure development.
