Reserve Bank Cancels the license of Tandur Mahila 
Co-operative Bank Ltd. Tandur – Andhra Pradesh 
 
In view of the fact that the operations of the Tandur Mahila Co-operative 
Urban Bank Ltd., Tandur (Andhra Pradesh), were practically defunct with no scope 
for revival in the foreseeable future and all efforts to ensure regulatory compliance in 
consultations with the Government of Andhra Pradesh had failed and the depositors 
were being inconvenienced by continued uncertainty, the Reserve Bank of India 
delivered the order dated August 22, 2011 canceling its license to the bank after the 
close of business on August 30, 2011. The Registrar of Co-operative Societies, 
Andhra Pradesh State has also been requested to issue an order for winding up the 
bank and appoint a liquidator for the bank. It may be highlighted that on liquidation, 
every depositor is entitled to repayment of his/her deposits up to a monetary ceiling 
of `1,00,000/- (Rupees one lakh only) from the Deposit Insurance and Credit 
Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) under usual terms and conditions. 
 
The bank was granted a license by Reserve Bank on June 21, 2000 to 
commence banking business. As per the findings of the statutory inspection of the 
bank conducted with reference to the financial position as on September 30, 2003, 
the bank was classified in Grade III. The bank was last inspected with reference to 
its financial position as on March 31, 2008. The findings of the inspection revealed 
that:  
 
i) The bank has not taken any step to improve its functioning 
ii) The gross NPAs of the bank constituted 27.6% of gross advances 
iii) The accumulated losses stood at `5.52 lakh 
 
The subsequent inspection of the bank from March 31, 2009 onwards could 
not be taken due to non availability of books of accounts such as Trial Balance, 
General Ledger, Subsidiary Books, etc. and therefore the bank’s financial position 
could not be ascertained.  
 
The bank has not been submitting various statutory and other returns since 
November 2008. In spite of various reminders issued to the bank, there had been no 
response from the bank, besides there had been misappropriation of funds. An 
enquiry conducted by the Registrar of Cooperative Societies under section 51 of 
Andhra Pradesh Co-operative Societies Act, 1964 confirmed the irregularities that an 
amount of ` 40.52 lakh was misappropriated. It also confirmed the involvement of the 
staff in mismanagement of the affairs of the bank.

The bank’s membership to local clearing house has been terminated on 
account of frequent returned instruments and non maintenance of adequate balance 
with the clearing house. Further, the bank had not complied with the requirements of 
minimum capital and reserves in terms of the provisions of Section 11 (1) of the Act. 
It was not in a position to pay its present and future depositors in full, as and when 
their claims accrue. The financial position of the bank left no scope for revival and in 
all likelihood, public interest would be adversely affected if the bank was allowed to 
carry on banking business. 
 
The Reserve Bank of India issued a show cause notice to the bank on May 
03, 2011, asking it to show cause as to why the license granted to it to conduct 
banking business should not be cancelled. The bank’s reply to the show cause 
notice was not found satisfactory. The bank itself admitted that revival is not 
possible. In the absence of any viable action plan to comply with statutory 
requirements, Reserve Bank of India took the extreme measure of canceling the 
license of the bank in the interest of the bank's depositors. With the cancellation of its 
license and commencement of liquidation proceedings, the process of paying the 
depositors of Tandur Mahila Co-operative Urban Bank Ltd., Tandur (Andhra 
Pradesh) will be set in motion subject to the terms and conditions of the Deposit 
Insurance Scheme. 
 
Consequent to the cancellation of its licence, Tandur Mahila Co-operative 
Urban Bank Ltd., Tandur (Andhra Pradesh), is prohibited from carrying on ‘banking 
business’ as defined in Section 5(b) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (AACS) 
including acceptance and repayment of deposits.

Manager, Urban Banks Department, Reserve Bank of India, Secretariat Road,
