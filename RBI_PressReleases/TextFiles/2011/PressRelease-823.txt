RBI releases Its Monthly RBI Bulletin for August 2011 
The Reserve Bank of India today released the August issue of its Monthly RBI 
Bulletin. The August Bulletin carries four special articles:  
(i) Developments in India's Balance of Payments during Fourth Quarter 
(January-March) of 2010-11 
 
(ii) India's External Debt as at end-March 2011 
  
(iii) Inflation Expectations Survey of Households: June 2011 (Round 24) 
  
(iv) Quarterly Industrial Outlook Survey: April-June 2011 (Round 54).  
Highlights of the special articles are: 
1. Developments in India's Balance of Payments during Fourth Quarter (January-
March) of 2010-11 
This article covers the analysis of major developments in India's Balance of 
Payment during the fourth quarter of 2010-11. The data are presented for the first time 
in a revised format as per the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) Balance of Payment 
Manual, Sixth Edition (BPM6). In the new format, capital account has been bifurcated 
into two separate heads, namely, 'capital account’ and ‘financial account’. 
The Reserve Bank has been compiling and publishing the data on India’s 
Balance of Payments (BoP) on a quarterly basis with a lag of one quarter. The 
compilation of BoP data is based on the IMF guidelines set out in its Balance of 
Payments Manual (BPM). The IMF has recently brought out revised Balance of 
Payment Manual - BPM6, suggesting revised compilation procedure as well as new 
format of standard presentation of BoP statistics. A working group under the 
chairmanship of Shri Deepak Mohanty, Executive Director, Reserve Bank of India, in 
November, 2010 had recommended that the BoP data for India should be presented in 
the new format of standard presentation of BoP as suggested by the IMF’s BPM6.  
The article also gives the Balance of Payments statistics in the old format for 
2007-08 to 2010-11 in Annex 1. Further, the correspondence between the old and new 
format in terms of various components of balance of payments have been given in 
Annex 2. In addition, the disaggregated data on invisibles for all the quarters of 2010-
11, are also published as part of this article.  
Main Findings 
• During Q4 of 2010-11, moderation in trade deficit, resulting from continued 
growth in merchandise exports coupled with improved net services receipts led 
to significant contraction in current account deficit (CAD). 
?nullnull???nullnullnull?? 2
• On a BoP basis, goods exports during Q4 of 2010-11 recorded a growth of 17.3 
per cent over the preceding quarter while imports rose by 10 per cent. Notably, 
import of non-monetary gold (import by entities other than central bank) at about 
US$ 12 billion about 50 per cent rise over the preceding quarter. With higher 
growth in exports relative to imports, the trade deficit on BoP basis, in absolute 
terms, moderated to US$ 29.7 billion from US$ 31.4 billion in the preceding 
quarter. 
• Net services recorded a growth of 21.6 per cent as compared to 1.3 per cent rise 
in the preceding quarter. While net secondary income (transfer) receipts 
remained buoyant at US$ 13.8 billion there has been net outflow under primary 
income account (investment income). 
• Accordingly, the CAD during Q4 of 2010-11 at US$ 5.4 billion witnessed sharp 
moderation compared to the earlier quarters during the year as well as to the 
corresponding quarter of the previous year. 
• Financial account witnessed moderation during the quarter primarily on account 
of portfolio flows and loans especially to the deposit taking institutions. There 
was a net accretion to foreign exchange reserves of US$ 2.0 billion during the 
quarter (excluding valuation). 
2. India's External Debt as at end-March 2011  
The article on India’s External Debt places India’s external debt, as at end-March 
2011, at US$ 305.9 billion or 17.3 per cent of GDP. The article also provides tables and 
charts on various details on external debt like External Debt Outstanding, External Debt 
by Component, Currency Composition, Instrument-wise classification, Short-Term Debt 
by Original Maturity and Residual Maturity. A detailed account of external debt as 
compiled in the standard format as at end-March 2011 in Rupee and US Dollar terms 
and revised data for the earlier quarters are provided in Statements 1 and 2. The article 
also provides a cross-country comparison of external debt among select developing 
countries. 
Main Finding 
• The long-term debt at US$ 240.9 billion and short-term debt at US$ 65 billion 
accounted for 78.8 per cent and 21.2 per cent, respectively, of the total external 
debt. 
 
3. Inflation Expectations Survey of Households: June 2011 (Round 24)  
This article presents the findings of Inflation Expectations Survey of Households 
th
conducted in the April-June 2011 quarter, the 24 round in the series. The survey 
captures the inflation expectations of 4,000 urban households across 12 cities for the 
next three months and for the next one year.  
These expectations are based on households’ individual consumption baskets 
and hence, these rates are not to be considered as predictors of any official measure of 
inflation. The households’ inflation expectations provide useful directional information 
on near-term inflationary pressures and also supplement other economic indicators to 
get a better indication of future inflation. The survey reflects expectations of the 
respondents and not of the Reserve Bank of India.  
Main Findings 
• The inflation expectations of households for the next three-month ahead have 
tended to be slightly lower at 11.8 per cent from 11.9 per cent assessed during  3
the last round of survey, however, for next one-year ahead they have moved 
slightly higher at 12.9 per cent from 12.7 per cent. 
• Households expect inflation to rise further by 60 and 170 basis points during next 
quarter and next year respectively from the perceived current rate of 11.2 per 
cent. 
• Unlike in last round of the Survey, the percentage of respondents expecting price 
rise have gone up for all product groups (viz., food, non food, households 
durables, housing and services).  
• On category-wise inflation expectations, daily-wage workers and housewives 
expect higher inflation rates compared with other categories. Across the cities, 
households in Bangalore expect the highest inflation while expectations to be the 
lowest for Hyderabad. 
• 25 per cent of the respondents felt that Reserve Bank is taking necessary action 
to control inflation, out of this, 51 per cent felt that Reserve Bank's action has an 
impact on controlling inflation.  
4.  Quarterly Industrial Outlook Survey: April-June 2011 (Round 54) 
th
This article presents the survey findings of the 54 round of the Industrial 
Outlook Survey. The survey was conducted for the April-June 2011 quarter and gives 
the assessment of business situation of companies in manufacturing sector, for the 
quarter April-June 2011, and their expectations for the ensuing quarter July-September 
2011. 
Main Findings 
• The survey results signal moderation of business conditions in the Indian 
manufacturing sector for assessment quarter as well as expectation quarter. 
  
• The Business Expectation Index – a measure that gives a single snapshot of the 
industrial outlook in each study quarter – declined from 122.0 to 116.3 for 
assessment quarter and marginally from 121.9 to 121.5 for the expectation 
quarter; however, it still remains much higher than 100 which is the threshold 
that separates contraction from expansion.
