RBI releases Report of the Working Group  
on Operating Procedure of Monetary Policy 
 
The Reserve Bank of India today placed on its website the Report of the Working 
Group on Operating Procedure of Monetary Policy (Chairman: Shri Deepak Mohanty). 
Comments on the Report may please be emailed or forwarded by end-March 2011 to 
the Adviser-in-Charge, Monetary Policy Department, Reserve Bank of India, Central 
Office, Mumbai 400 001. 
 
The key recommendations of the Working Group are: 
• The liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) with some modifications should be the key 
element in the operating framework of the Reserve Bank. 
• The modified LAF should operate in a deficit liquidity mode and the liquidity level 
should be contained around (+)/(-) one per cent of net demand and time liabilities 
(NDTL) of banks for optimal monetary transmission. 
• The repo rate should be the single policy rate to unambiguously signal the stance 
of monetary policy to achieve macroeconomic objectives of growth with price 
stability. It will operate within a corridor set by the Bank Rate and the reverse repo 
rate. As the repo rate changes, the Bank Rate and the reverse repo rate should 
change automatically.  
• The Reserve Bank at its discretion could conduct simultaneous auctions for longer 
period if the liquidity situation so warrants.  However, such actions should be at 
variable prices as they will be purely for liquidity management rather than for 
signalling the policy rate. 
• The Bank Rate should be reactivated as a discount rate as envisaged in the 
Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934. It will be the rate at which the Reserve Bank will 
provide liquidity under a new collateralised Exceptional Standing Facility (ESF) up 
to one per cent of NDTL of banks to be carved out of the required statutory liquidity 
ratio (SLR) portfolio.  The Bank Rate will constitute the upper bound of the 
corridor.   
• The reverse repo rate will have a negative spread on the repo rate and it will be 
the rate at which the Reserve Bank will absorb liquidity under the LAF. The 
reverse repo rate will constitute the lower bound of the corridor. 
• The optimal width of the policy corridor should be fixed at 150 basis points and 
should not be changed in the normal circumstance.  The corridor should be 
asymmetric with the spread between the policy repo rate and reverse repo rate be 
twice as much as the spread between the repo rate and the Bank Rate.  With a 
corridor of 150 basis points, the Bank Rate should be fixed at repo rate plus 50 
basis points and the reverse repo rate at repo rate minus 100 basis points. 
• The weighted average overnight call money rate should be the operating target of 
the Reserve Bank. The operating objective should be to contain this rate around 
the repo rate within the corridor. 
• The Reserve Bank should conduct second LAF (SLAF) on a regular basis.

• Persistent liquidity in excess of (+) / (-) one per cent of the NDTL should be 
managed through other instruments. 
• Banks should be incentivised to progressively mark-to-market their SLR portfolio to 
improve the effectiveness of open market operations (OMO) as an instrument of 
liquidity management. The Working Group recognises that in due course, the 
accounting standard would get aligned with the international financial reporting 
standards (IFRS).  
• To improve liquidity management, a scheme of auctioning of government surplus 
cash balance at the discretion of the Reserve Bank be put in place in consultation 
with the Government.  
• Collateral pool for reverse repo operation under the LAF could be extended to 
include oil bonds. 
• The methodology for the Reserve Bank’s internal liquidity forecast should be 
strengthened. Information on government cash balances should be put in public 
domain with minimum time lag for better liquidity assessment by market 
participants. 
• The minimum level of reserves to be maintained on any day by banks with the 
Reserve Bank during a fortnight should be raised from the present level of 70 per 
cent to 80 per cent of the required cash reserve ratio (CRR).   
• The T+0 transactions for short-term money market segments (collateralised 
borrowing and lending obligations (CBLO) and market repo) should be extended 
up to the cut-off timing (i.e., 4.30 PM) for customers in real time gross settlement 
(RTGS) so that the banking system could square off their CRR position efficiently.  
Background 
The Working Group on Operating Procedure of Monetary Policy was constituted 
on October 1, 2010 in pursuance of the First Quarter Review of Monetary Policy for 
2010-11 announced on July 27, 2010. Members of the Working Group were drawn from 
financial markets, academia and the Reserve Bank. The Working Group was assigned 
the following terms of reference:  
i) to survey the operating procedures of major central banks;  
ii) to review the current operating procedure of monetary policy in India, in 
particular, the Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF);  
iii) to examine the operation of the LAF with regard to:  
a) the width of the corridor  
b) the frequency and timing of auctions  
c) the maturity period of repo and reverse repo operations;  
iv) to assess the role of the Bank Rate;  
v) to examine the role of standing facilities such as the export credit refinance; and  
vi) to suggest changes to the current operating procedure of monetary policy in India 
in the light of international practices and domestic experience, with particular 
reference to:  
a) whether there should be a corridor at all  
b) if so, whether its width should be fixed or variable under specified 
conditions  
c) if so, what instruments/mechanisms may be necessary to enable the 
corridor to function efficiently.
