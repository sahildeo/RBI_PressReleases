th
 The Reserve Bank of India today launched 24 round of the Inflation 
Expectations Survey with April-June 2011 as the current reference period. The 
Survey seeks qualitative responses from households on price changes (general 
prices as well as prices of specific product groups) in the next three months as well 
as in the next one year and quantitative responses on current, three-month ahead 
and one-year ahead inflation rates. The Reserve Bank will use results of this Survey 
as one of the important inputs to the monetary policy formulation. 
   
Inflation expectations are subjective assessments of around 4000 households 
across 12 cities covered in the Survey round and are based on households’ 
individual consumption baskets. 
  
The agency M/s Beaumont Consultancy Services, Mumbai has been engaged 
to conduct this round of the Survey on behalf of the Reserve Bank of India. For this 
purpose, the agency will approach the households during the quarter.
