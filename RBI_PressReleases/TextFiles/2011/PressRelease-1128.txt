RBI releases DRG Study on “Productivity, Efficiency and Competitiveness of 
the Indian Manufacturing Sector” 
The Reserve Bank of India today released a DRG Study entitled, 
“Productivity, Efficiency and Competitiveness of the Indian Manufacturing Sector”. 
The study is co-authored by Prof. Pushpa Trivedi (Indian Institute of Technology 
Bombay), Shri L. Lakshmanan (Assistant Adviser, Internal Debt Management 
Department), Dr. Rajeev Jain (Assistant Adviser, Department of Economic and 
Policy Research) and Dr. Yogesh Kumar Gupta (Assistant Adviser, Department of 
Statistics and Information Management) of the Reserve Bank.  
This study focuses on the productivity and efficiency of India’s manufacturing 
sector. The study covers the time-span 1980-81 to 2007-08 in the case of overall 
organised manufacturing sector. It undertakes disaggregate analysis for: 18 states of 
India (to highlight the regional dimensions); six major component industries within 
manufacturing sector; organised versus unorganised segments of the manufacturing 
sector, etc. This empirical exercise has been done for the period 1980-81 to 2003-
04. The productivity and efficiency of ‘Selected Public Ltd. Manufacturing 
Companies’ has also been measured for the period 1993-94 to 2004-05. The 
methodology used in the study covers both parametric and non-parametric 
approaches.  
The major findings of the study are summarised below: 
• For the period 1980-81 to 2003-04, the total factor productivity growth (TFPG) 
for organised manufacturing sector is estimated as 0.92 per cent per annum 
(pcpa) by Growth Accounting Approach (GAA) which is almost half of that 
obtained by the Production Function Approach (PFA), i.e., 1.81 pcpa. Hence, 
the contribution of TFPG to growth of output by these two approaches lies 
between 13 to 25 percent. Based on the RBI dataset on public limited 
companies, TFPG of about 1.5 pcpa is estimated for the period 1993-94 to 
2004-05. 
 
• As regards the industry-wise TFPG performance of organised manufacturing 
sector (measured by the GAA), Food, Beverages and Tobacco (FBT) 
industry, followed by the Textiles (TEX) industry are the worst performers 
while Machinery and Transport Equipment (MTE) and Chemical (CHEM) 
industries are the best performing industries. The TFPG varied between -0.41 
(for FBT) and 1.47 pcpa (for MTE). The PFA estimates provide us with the 
range of TFPG between 3.05 for TEX and 0.97 pcpa for Leather (LEATH).   
 
• The inter-State performance of TFPG of organised manufacturing sector (as 
measured by the GAA) indicates that Bihar (including Jharkhand), Rajasthan 
?nullnull???nullnullnull?? 2
and Andhra Pradesh turn out to be best performers while the worst 
performers are Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and Punjab. Bihar exhibits the highest 
TFPG and Tamil Nadu exhibits the lowest TFPG. This has to be juxtaposed 
with the fact that Bihar witnessed a negative growth rate of employment and 
Tamil Nadu witnessed a significantly higher growth rate of employment in 
comparison to the corresponding national figure.  
 
• Using the RBI dataset, efficiency of 449 companies for the period 1993-94 to 
2004-05, employing both data envelopment (DEA) and stochastic frontier 
production function (SFPF) approaches has been estimated in this study. The 
mean efficiency levels estimated under the alternative assumptions highlight 
the fact that there exists an ample scope for improving efficiency in the Indian 
manufacturing sector. The SFPF approach highlights the lowest mean 
efficiency of Food, Beverages and Tobacco (FBT) and Textiles (TEX) and 
thereby validates the measurement of TFPG emanating from GAA. Moreover, 
the TFPG measured using the Malmquist Index for this dataset also identifies 
the FBT and TEX as the poorest performers while top performers are the MTE 
and METAL industries. This throws some light on why the TEX has been one 
of the poorest performers on exports front and why metal and engineering 
goods industries have been the top performers. 
 
• The estimation of TFPG for the unorganised sector was constrained due to 
the data limitations in terms of the construction of capital stock series. In view 
of this, labour productivity for the unorganised sector has been estimated and 
compared with that for the organised manufacturing sector. It is found that 
growth of labour productivity in unorganised sector has increased more or 
less in tandem with that in the organised sector during the period under study. 
However, the disparity in the ‘levels’ of labour productivity between organised 
and unorganised sectors are rather sharp and have perpetuated. Organised 
manufacturing sector had labour productivity which was 13, 14 and 15 times 
of that observed in its unorganised counterpart in years 1989-90, 1994-95 and 
2000-01, respectively. 
 
• While examining whether TFPG for the organised manufacturing sector was 
higher or lower for the various industries and States during the post-
liberalisation period, it was found that TFPG has witnessed either deceleration 
or no acceleration across industries (except for Metal industry) and across 
States (barring West Bengal and Haryana) as per the GAA. The policy 
dummy in production function approach indicates a shift in production function 
only for Maharashtra. However, if the averages of TFPG over shorter periods 
are taken, there seems to be revival of TFPG in the post-nineties.  
 
• In the post-reform period, trade barriers (proxied by the ratio of import duties 
to import payments) turned out to be a significant determinant of TFPG of 
organised manufacturing sector with a negative sign, indicating that the 
dismantling of the trade barriers has had a positive impact on TFPG. The 
increasing openness of the manufacturing sector (as captured by the growth 
of exports) also turned out to be positively associated with TFPG of the 
organised manufacturing sector.
