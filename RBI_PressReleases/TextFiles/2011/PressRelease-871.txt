Background 
 The Reserve Bank of India had constituted a Committee under the 
chairmanship of Shri M. Damodaran, former Chairman, Securities and Exchange 
Board of India, to look into banking services rendered to retail and small customers, 
including pensioners. The Committee was also required to look into - 
- the system of grievance redressal mechanism prevalent in banks, its structure 
and efficacy and suggest measures for expeditious resolution of complaints,  
- functioning of Banking Ombudsman Scheme, its structure, legal framework 
and recommend steps to make it more effective and responsive,  
- possible methods of leveraging technology for better customer service with 
proper safeguards, including legal aspects in the light of increasing use of 
Internet and information technology for bank products and services and to 
recommend measures to enhance consumer protection, and 
- the role of the Board of Directors of banks and the role of regulators in 
customer service matters.  
The Committee interacted with various stakeholders across the country on all 
aspects of customer service - fair treatment, improvement in the service to 
pensioners, attitude of the bank staff towards the small and rural customers, service 
charges and fees, loans, transparency in operations, grievance redressal, 
promptness in service, education and information on new products, services, 
customer rights, expectations etc. It had called for suggestions from members of 
public. In response to the Committee’s appeal more than 1000 suggestions were 
received from public through e-mail, fax and post. Based on the interactions and 
suggestions received, the Committee submitted its report to the Reserve Bank on 
July 04, 2011.
