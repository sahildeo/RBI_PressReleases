RBI releases Report of Expert Committee on Licensing of 
New Urban Co-operative Banks (UCBs) 
The Reserve Bank of India today placed on its website the Report of Expert 
Committee on Licensing of New Urban Co-operative Banks (Chairman:                  
Shri Y.H. Malegam). Suggestions and comments on the Report may please be 
forwarded by October 31, 2011 to the Chief General Manager-in-Charge, Urban Banks 
Department, Reserve Bank of India, Central Office, Garment House, First Floor, Dr. 
Annie Besant Road, Worli, Mumbai – 400 018 (Fax No. 022-24974030) or emailed. 
The main recommendations of the Expert Committee are: 
• UCBs play a useful role and there is need for a greater presence of UCBs in 
unbanked districts and in centers having population less than 5 lakh. It is 
necessary to encourage new entrants to open banks and branches in States and 
Districts which are unbanked or inadequately banked. It is equally necessary to 
discourage new entrants from opening branches in Districts and population 
centers which are already adequately banked. 
 
• The existing well managed co-operative credit societies meeting certain financial 
criteria like profits, capital adequacy, NPAs’ proportion etc. should be given 
priority for granting licenses as urban co-operative banks particularly in 
unbanked or inadequately banked centers. 
Entry Point Capital Prescription 
The proposed entry point norms for the new UCBs are as under: 
S.No. Particulars Minimum Capital 
(a) UCBs operating in only one state in  
(i) North Eastern Regions ` 50 Lakh 
(ii) In other States but confined to unbanked districts 
(iii) In other States but confined to ‘C’ and ‘D’ category 
population centers of banked districts 
(b) UCB operating in only one State with 50% or more ` 100 lakh 
branches in ‘C’ and ‘D’ category population centers 
(c) UCB operating in only one State but without requirement to ` 300 lakh 
have branches in ‘C’ and ‘D’ category population centers 
(d) UCBs which wishes to operate in more than one State after ` 500 lakh 
five years of successful operations 
 
Note : (1)  In respect of existing co-operative credit societies opting to be converted in to UCBs, the 
minimum capital required will be as per norms prescribed above or as per RBI’s per 
branch head room capital prescription, whichever is higher, 
(2)  Unbanked District means a District without any existing UCB.

Organization Structure of New UCBs 
 
• There should be segregation of the ownership of the UCB as a co-operative 
society from its functioning as a bank. The new organization structure shall 
consist of a Board of Management in addition to the Board of Directors.  
 
• The Board of Directors (BoD) would be elected in accordance with the provisions 
of the respective Co-operative Societies Acts and would be regulated and 
controlled by the RCS / CRCS.  
 
• The (BoD) will establish a Board of Management (BoM), consisting of persons 
with professional skills, which shall be entrusted with the responsibility for the 
control and direction of the affairs of the Bank assisted by a CEO who shall have 
the responsibility for the management of the Bank. 
 
• RBI would have unfettered powers to control and regulate the functioning of the 
UCB and of its BoM and of the CEO in exactly the same way as it controls and 
regulates the functioning of the Board of Directors and the Chief Executive in the 
case of a commercial bank. 
 
• It should be made a condition of the license that every new UCB should be 
required to have a Board of Management (BoM) to be appointed by the Board of 
Directors (BoD) and a Chief Executive Officer (CEO) to be appointed by the 
BoM. While the BoD will be responsible for laying down the broad contours of 
strategy, the BoM will be vested with the mandate to direct and control the day-
to-day operations of the UCB within the limits set by the BoD. At least 51 per 
cent of the members of the BoM should have special knowledge or practical 
experience in the matters specified in Section 10 A(2) of the B. R. Act, 1949. 
 
• Members of the BoD can be members of the BOM provided they fulfill the 
conditions specified. Members of the BoM can be paid such sitting fees as the 
BOD may decide subject to a ceiling to be specified by RBI. The BoM to follow a 
Code of Corporate Governance to be specified by RBI. 
 
• The CEO shall be responsible for the management of the whole or substantially 
the whole of the affairs of the UCB but shall be subject to the control and 
direction of the BoM. The appointment of the CEO shall be subject to the prior 
approval of RBI. 
 
• Audit by a Chartered Accountant to be appointed by the BoM from out of a panel 
of approved auditors maintained by RBI and subject to rotation after four years. 
 
Umbrella Organization 
 
• There should be two separate Umbrella Organizations viz. a national level 
organization which provides payments and settlement services and other 
services normally provided by central banks as also liquidity support to its 
members; and one or more organizations which provide the management, IT, 
training and other services which the UCB sector needs. 
 
• The national level UO should preferably be in the form of a multi-state UCB with 
membership being restricted to and mandatory for all UCBs other than 
scheduled UCBs. 
 
• Member UCBs should be required to maintain their CRR in the form of deposits 
with the UO.  
 
• The UO should invest its funds only in the form of balances with RBI, deposits 
with commercial banks or in SLR securities and in no other form. 
  3
• The UO should offer Repos and Reverse Repos facilities to UCBs in the same 
manner as RBI offers to commercial banks and at the same rates of interest.  In 
turn, it should enjoy Repos and Reverse Repos facilities with RBI. 
 
• UCBs can avail of Repos facilities only to the extent of their excess SLR 
holdings.   
 
• Until the Payments and Settlements facilities are provided directly to UCBs, the 
UO will act as a gateway to provide these services for a fee to UCBs. In turn, the 
UO will be a member of the Payments and Settlement System.  
 
• Being a UCB, the UO would have a Board of Management and will be subject to 
the regulation, supervision and inspection of RBI. 
 
It was announced in the Annual Policy Statement 2010-11 to set up a Committee 
comprising all stakeholders for studying the advisability of granting new urban co-
operative banking licences under Section 22 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 [As 
Applicable to Co-operative Societies (AACS)]. Accordingly, the Reserve Bank of India 
constituted an Expert Committee under the Chairmanship of Shri Y.H. Malegam. 
 
The Committee was assigned the following terms of reference: 
 
i) To review the role and performance of UCBs over the last decade and 
especially since the adoption of VISION document in 2004, 
ii) To review the need for organization of new UCBs in the context of the 
existing legal framework for UCBs, the thrust on financial inclusion in the 
economic policy and proposed entry of new commercial banks into the 
banking space, 
iii) To review the extant regulatory policy on setting up of new UCBs and lay 
down entry point norms for new UCBs, 
iv) To examine whether licensing could be restricted only to financially sound 
and well managed cooperative credit societies through conversion route, 
v) To make recommendations relating to the legal and regulatory structure to 
facilitate the growth of sound Urban Co-operative Banks especially in the 
matter of raising capital consistent with co-operative principles;  
vi) To examine the feasibility of an umbrella organization for the Urban Co-
operative Banking Sector; and 
vii) To examine other issues incidental to licensing of Urban Co-operative Banks 
and make appropriate recommendations.
