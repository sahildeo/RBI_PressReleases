Minutes of the October 19, 2011 Meeting of the 
Technical Advisory Committee on Monetary Policy 
 The Reserve Bank has been placing the main points of discussion of the 
Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) on Monetary Policy meeting in public domain 
with a lag of roughly four weeks after its meeting. The minutes of the twenty-fifth 
meeting of the TAC held on July 20, 2011 were placed in public domain on August 
18, 2011. The twenty-sixth meeting of the Committee was held on October 19, 2011 
in the run up to the Second Quarter Review of the Monetary Policy 2011-12 on 
October 25, 2011. The main points of discussion of this meeting are set out below.   
2.  The TAC members reviewed the recent global and domestic macroeconomic 
developments. They felt that the global macroeconomic situation continued to be 
fragile. Most members were not very optimistic about the immediate resolution of the 
euro area debt problem and felt that the probability of an event shock was high. The 
policy response by the authorities was too little and too late. The negative impact in 
the case of an event shock on emerging economies could be serious through the 
trade, financing and confidence channels. Members expressed concerns over the slow 
growth in the US. They also observed that the growth was slowing down in emerging 
market economies (EMEs).  
3.  Reflecting on the domestic macroeconomic developments, all members felt 
that the economic growth was moderating.  In particular, investment activity was 
slowing down due to tight monetary policy and several other factors, including 
global uncertainty and delay in clearing the projects. A concern was also expressed 
about the service sector, which was showing signs of moderation. Some members 
felt that exports growth will slow down, going forward, as a result of which trade 
deficit may widen.  
4.  All members observed that inflation was a major concern. They also felt that 
the inflation would not ease immediately. A member observed that the output gap 
had narrowed down significantly which was reflected in the elevated level of 
inflation. However, some other members felt that inflation was driven by 
external/supply side factors and, therefore, the monetary policy tightening was 
impacting investment and growth and not inflation. In view of slowing global 
economy, it was expected that the global commodity prices may soften gradually, 
which should help moderate inflation, going forward. A member felt that a fall in 
food inflation from past high levels would help moderate inflation expectations. 
Some members, while suggesting for a pause, felt that the message of the Reserve 
Bank’s policy should be hawkish.

5.  Some members raised concerns over the high fiscal deficit and the risk of it 
slipping in the current financial year. This, combined with the increase in 
borrowings by the Government, will pose a major challenge for liquidity and 
monetary management for the Reserve Bank.  
6.  On monetary measures, while one external member suggested an increase 
in the repo rate by 25 basis points, other five external members were of the view 
that the repo rate should not be changed. One of the external members suggested an 
increase in the SLR by 25 basis points, so that the borrowing by banks from the LAF 
window of the Reserve Bank was curtailed. The member further recommended that the 
provisioning for standard assets could be relooked to promote investment activity. 
Another external member suggested a nominal exchange rate appreciation to reduce 
the cost pressure on the economy.   
7.  The meeting was chaired by Dr. D. Subbarao, Governor. Other members 
present were: Dr. Subir Gokarn, Vice-Chairman, Dr. K.C. Chakrabarty, Shri Anand 
Sinha, Shri H.R. Khan, Dr. Shankar Acharya, Shri Y.H. Malegam, Prof. Sudipto 
Mundle, Prof. Errol D’Souza and Prof. Ashima Goyal. Dr. Rakesh Mohan and Prof. 
Indira Rajaraman could not attend the meeting. Dr. Mohan submitted his written 
views. Shri Deepak Mohanty, Dr. Janak Raj, Shri B.M. Misra, Shri Pardeep Maria 
and Shri Amitava Sardar were in attendance.
