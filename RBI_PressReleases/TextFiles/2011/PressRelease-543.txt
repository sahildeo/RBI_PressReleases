with an increase of US$ 3.7 billion during the same period previous year. The foreign

The valuation gains, reflecting the depreciation of the US dollar against major 
currencies, accounted for US$ 5.4 billion during April-June 2011 as compared with 
valuation loss of US$ 7.0 billion during the same period last year. Accordingly, 
valuation gains accounted for 50.1 per cent of the total increase in foreign exchange 
reserves during first quarter of 2011-12.
