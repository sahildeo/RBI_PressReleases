Investment by FIIs under PIS : Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd.  
 
 The Reserve Bank of India has today notified that under Portfolio Investment 
Scheme (PIS), Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) can now purchase equity shares 
and convertible debentures of Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd., through primary markets 
and stock exchanges in India. The purchases can be made up to 33% of the paid up 
capital of the company, as it has passed resolutions to this effect at its Board of 
Directors' and the General Body Meetings. Raising of FII investment limit to 33% is, 
however, subject to the condition that the aggregate foreign investment in the bank 
will not exceed the composite sectoral cap of 74% as prescribed by the Government 
from time to time.
