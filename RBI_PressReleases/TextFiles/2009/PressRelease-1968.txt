RBI cancels the Licence of Vasantdada Shetkari Sahakari Bank Limited, Maharashtra 
 
The Reserve Bank of India has on January 7, 2009 cancelled the licence of Vasantdada 
Shetkari Sahakari Bank Limited, Sangli, Maharashtra. The licence has ben cancelled as the 
bank had ceased to be solvent, all efforts to revive it in close consultation with the Government 
of Maharashtra had failed and the depositors were being inconvenienced by continued 
uncertainty. The Reserve Bank has requested the Registrar of Co-operative Societies, 
Maharashtra to issue an order for winding up the bank and appointing a liquidator.  
Consequent to the cancellation of its licence, Vasantdada Shetkari Sahakari Bank 
Limited, Sangli, Maharashtra, is prohibited from carrying on ‘banking business’ as defined in 
Section 5(b) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (As applicable to Co-operative Societies) 
including acceptance and repayment of deposits.  
With the cancellation of its licence and commencement of liquidation proceedings, the 
process of paying the depositors of Vasantdada Shetkari Sahakari Bank Limited, Sangli, 
Maharashtra, will be set in motion subject to the terms and conditions of the Deposit Insurance 
Scheme. 
On liquidation, every depositor is entitled to repayment of his/her deposits up to a 
monetary ceiling of Rs.1,00,000/- (Rupees One lakh only) from the Deposit Insurance and 
Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) under usual terms and conditions.  
For any clarifications, depositors may approach Shri P.K. Arora, Deputy General 
Manager, Urban Banks Department, Mumbai Regional Office, Reserve Bank of India, Second 
Floor, Garment House, Mumbai 400 018. Telephone : (022) 2493 9930-49, Direct : (022) 2493 
5348, Fax : (022) 2493 5495, Email.  
The bank was granted a licence by the Reserve Bank of India on July 28, 1983 to 
commence banking business. The statutory inspection of the bank conducted by the Reserve 
Bank of India with reference to its financial position as on March 31, 2007 revealed 
deterioration in its financial position. Certain operational restrictions were therefore imposed on 
the bank.  The latest statutory inspection of the bank with reference to its financial position as 
on March 31, 2008 revealed severe deterioration in its financial position.  Accordingly, the 
Reserve Bank of India imposed all inclusive directions under Section 35A of the Banking 
Regulation Act 1949(As Applicable to Co-operative Societies) with a ceiling of Rs. 1000/- on 
withdrawal of deposits on July 25, 2008.  The Reserve Bank also issued a Requisition dated 
October 27, 2008 to the Registrar of Co-operative Societies, Maharashtra State for 
supersession of the board of directors of the bank under section 110 A of the Maharashtra Co-
operative Societies Act, 1960. 
The bank was served a notice on October 22, 2008, to show cause as to why the 
licence granted to it should not be cancelled and why steps should not be taken to wind up the 
bank. The bank’s reply to the show cause notice was examined and was found unsatisfactory. 
The bank also did not come out with any concrete plan for revival or any proposal for its 
merger. It was, therefore, decided to cancel its licence.
