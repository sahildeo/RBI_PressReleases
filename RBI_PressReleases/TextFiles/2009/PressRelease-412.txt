India's Balance of Payments Developments during the First Quarter 
(April-June 2009) of 2009-10 
Preliminary data on Indiaís balance of payments (BoP) for the first quarter 
(Q1) i.e., April-June 2009 of the financial year 2009-10, are now available. The full 
details of these data are set out in the standard format of BoP presentation in 
Statements I and II.  
Major Highlights of BoP 
(i) The decline in exports which started since October 2008 continued during the 
first quarter of 2009-10. Import payments, on a BoP basis, also continued its 
declining trend mainly due to lower oil import bill. 
(ii) Private transfer receipts remained buoyant and increased by 9.4 per cent to         
US$ 13.3 billion during Q1 of 2009-10. Exports of software services, however, 
declined during Q1 of 2009-10. 
(iii) Despite net invisibles surplus at US$ 20.2 billion, the large trade deficit (US$ 
26.0 billion) mainly on account of sharp decline in exports led to a current 
account deficit of US$ 5.8 billion in Q1 of  2009-10  (US$ 9.0 billion during Q1 
of 2008-09). 
(iv) With the revival in capital inflows to India, particularly foreign investments, the 
capital account showed a turnaround from a negative balance in last two 
quarters of 2008-09 to a positive balance of US$ 6.7 billion during Q1 of 2009-
10.  
(v) Portfolio investment witnessed a sharp turnaround from net outflows of US$ 2.7 
billion in Q4 of 2008-09 to net inflows of US$ 8.3 billion during Q1 of 2009-10.  
(vi) NRI deposits also witnessed higher inflows reflecting the positive impact of the 
revisions in the ceiling interest rate on NRI deposits. 
(vii) There was a marginal increase in reserves on BoP basis (i.e., excluding 
valuation) during Q1 of 2009-10. However, the foreign exchange reserves 
including valuation increased by US$ 13.2 billion during Q1 of 2009-10 implying 
that the increase in reserves during this period was mainly due to valuation 
gains as the US dollar has depreciated against major currencies.

Merchandise Trade 
Exports 
(i) The decline in exports which started since October 2008 continued during the 
first quarter of 2009-10. On a BoP basis, Indiaís merchandise exports recorded 
a decline of 21.0 per cent in Q1 of 2009-10 as against an increase of 43.0 per 
cent in Q1 of 2008-09. 
(ii) As per the data released by the Directorate General of Commercial Intelligence 
and Statistics (DGCI&S), merchandise exports declined by 26.4 per cent in Q1 
of 2009-10 as against a higher growth of 37.4 per cent in Q1 of 2008-09, 
reflecting fall in demand worldwide due to the global economic crisis.  
Imports 
(i) Import payments, on a BoP basis, also continued its declining trend. Imports 
declined by 19.6 per cent in Q1 of 2009-10 as against a positive growth of 42.9 
per cent in Q1 of 2008-09.  
(ii) According to the data released by the DGCI&S, the decline in imports is mainly 
attributed to the sharp fall in oil import payments due to lower crude oil prices 
during Q1 of 2009-10 (US$ 63.9 per barrel in Q1 of 2009-10 as against US$ 
119 per barrel in Q1 of 2008-09). POL imports recorded a sharp decline of 56.9 
per cent during Q1 of 2009-10 as against a sharp increase of 74.2 per cent 
during Q1 of 2008-09. As per the data released by the Ministry of Petroleum & 
Natural Gas, Government of India, POL imports showed a decline of 45.1 per 
cent during Q1 of 2009-10 despite a quantity growth of 10 per cent mainly due 
to lower crude oil price (Chart 1). 3

(iii) According to the DGCI&S data, out of the total decline in imports of US$ 
26.7 billion in Q1 of 2009-10 over the corresponding previous quarter, oil 
imports declined by US$ 16.8 billion (share of 63.1 per cent in the decline in 
total imports during Q1 of 2009-10 as against 59.8 per cent share in total 
increase in imports during Q1 of 2008-09), while non-oil imports decreased 
by US$ 9.8 billion (share of 36.9 per cent in the decline in total imports  
during Q1 of 2009-10 as against 40.2 per cent share in total increase in 
imports during Q1 of 2008-09).  
Trade Balance 
(i) On a BoP basis, the decline in the pace of exports was higher than that of 
imports during Q1 of 2009-10 which led to a large trade deficit (Chart 2). 
The trade deficit on a BoP basis in Q1 of 2009-10 (US$ 26.0 billion) was, 
however, less than that in Q1 of 2008-09 (US$ 31.4 billion).

Invisibles 
(i) During Q1 of 2009-10, invisibles receipts declined marginally, while invisibles 
payments recorded a positive growth (Table 2). In net terms, the invisibles 
balance at US$ 20.2 billion was lower than that in the corresponding period of 
the previous year (US$ 22.4 billion), though higher than that in Q4 of 2008-09 
(US$ 19.3 billion) (Table 3). 
Invisibles Receipts 
(i) Invisibles receipts registered a marginal decline of 0.7 per cent in Q1 of 2009-
10 (as against a higher growth of 30.3 per cent in Q1 of 2008-09) on account of 
a decline in almost all categories of services except insurance and financial 
services and a decline of 20.3 per cent in investment income receipts.  
(ii) Exports of software services declined by 11.5 per cent during Q1 of 2009-10 as 
against an increase of 37.6 per cent in Q1 of 2008-09 (Chart 3). According to 
the NASSCOM, software services exports are projected to grow by 4 to 7 per 
cent to US$ 48 to 50 billion during the financial year 2009-10. 
(iii) Travel receipts at US$ 2.3 billion during Q1 of 2009-10 declined by 8.7 per cent 
as against an increase of 19.9 per cent in Q1 of 2008-09 reflecting a slowdown 
in tourist arrivals in the country since November 2008. According to the data 
released by the Ministry of Tourism, foreign tourist arrivals declined by 1.8 per 
cent in Q1 of 2009-10.

(iv) Private transfers are in the form of (i) Inward remittances from Indian workers 
abroad for family maintenance, (ii) Local withdrawals from NRI Rupee deposits, 
(iii) Gold and silver brought through passenger baggage, and (iv) Personal 
gifts/donations to charitable/religious institutions. 
(v) Private transfer receipts, comprising mainly remittances from Indians working 
overseas and local withdrawals from NRI Rupee deposits, remained buoyant 
and increased by 9.4 per cent to US$ 13.3 billion during Q1 of 2009-10 from 
US$ 12.2 billion in Q1 of 2008-09. Private transfer receipts constituted 17.2 per 
cent of current receipts in Q1 of 2009-10 (13.8 per cent in Q1 of 2008-09). 
(vi) NRI deposits when withdrawn domestically, form part of private transfers 
because once withdrawn for local use these become unilateral transfers and do 
not have any quid pro quo. Such local withdrawals/redemptions from NRI

deposits cease to exist as liability in the capital account of the balance of 
payments and assume the form of private transfers, which is included in the 
current account of balance of payments. 
(vii) Under the NRI deposits, both inflows as well as outflows remained large in the 
recent past. A major part of outflows from NRI deposits is in the form of local 
withdrawals. These withdrawals, however, are not actually repatriated but are 
utilized domestically. During Q1 of 2009-10, the share of local withdrawals in 
total outflows from NRI deposits declined marginally to 59.5 per cent from 62.5 
per cent in Q1 of 2008-09 (Table 4).

(xi) Investment income receipts amounted to US$ 2.7 billion in Q1 of 2009-10 as 
compared with US$ 3.4 billion in Q1 of 2008-09 (Table 8). The decline in 
receipts under investment income was due to lower interest rate abroad.

Invisibles Payments 
(i) Invisibles payments recorded a positive growth of 11.9 per cent in Q1 of 2009-
10 (13.5 per cent in Q1 of 2008-09) mainly due to growth in payments under 
services and income account. In the services account, however, payments 
under travel, transportation, G.N.I.E. and software services recorded a negative 
growth in Q1 of 2009-10.   
(ii) Investment income payments (include mainly the interest payments on 
commercial borrowings, external assistance and non-resident deposits, and 
reinvested earnings of the foreign direct investment (FDI) enterprises operating 
in India) increased marginally to US$ 4.4 billion during Q1 of 2009-10 (US$ 4.1 
billion in Q1 of 2008-09) mainly due to increased reinvested earnings of FDI 
companies in India (Table 8).  
Invisibles Balance 
(iii) A combined effect of decline in invisibles receipts and increase in invisibles 
payments led to marginally lower net invisibles (invisibles receipts minus 
invisibles payments) at US$ 20.2 billion  in Q1 of 2009-10 than that in the 
corresponding period of the previous year (US$ 22.4 billion) (Table 3). At this 
level, however, the invisibles surplus financed about 77.7 per cent of trade 
deficit during Q1 of 2009-10 (71.3 per cent during Q1 of 2008-09). 
Current Account Balance 
(i) Despite net invisibles surplus, the large trade deficit mainly on account of sharp 
decline in exports led to a current account deficit of US$ 5.8 billion in Q1 of       
2009-10  (US$ 9.0 billion during Q1 of 2008-09) (Chart 4).

Capital Account  
(i) The gross capital inflows to India revived during Q1 of 2009-10 as compared 
to the last two quarters of 2008-09 manifesting confidence in Indiaís long-term 
growth prospects. The gross inflows were, however, at US$ 78.5 billion as 
compared to US$ 90.9 billion in Q1 of 2008-09 mainly led by inflows under 
FIIs, FDI and NRI deposits (Table 9). Gross capital outflows during Q1 of 
2009-10 stood lower at US$ 71.8 billion as against US$ 79.7 billion in Q1 of 
2008-09. 
(ii) With the revival in capital inflows to India, particularly foreign investments, the 
capital account showed a turnaround from a negative balance in last two 
quarters of 2008-09 to a positive balance of US$ 6.7 billion during Q1 of 2009-
10 (US$ 11.1 billion in Q1 of 2008-09) (Table 10).

(iii) Net capital inflows, however, was lower in Q1 of 2009-10 as compared to that 
in the corresponding period of last year mainly because of large net outflows 
under short-term trade credits and banking capital.

(iv) Net FDI inflows (net inward FDI minus net outward FDI) amounted to US$ 6.8 
billion in Q1 of 2009-10 (US$ 9.0 billion in Q1 of 2008-09). Net inward FDI 
stood at US$ 9.5 billion during Q1 of 2009-10 (US$ 11.9 billion in Q1 of 2008-
09). Net outward FDI stood at US$ 2.6 billion in Q1 of 2009-10 as compared 
with US$ 2.9 billion in Q1 of 2008-09. 
(v) During Q1 of 2009-10, FDI to India was channeled mainly into manufacturing 
sector (19.2 per cent), real estate activities (15.6 per cent), financial services 
(15.4 per cent), construction (12.2 per cent) and business services (11.7 per 
cent). Mauritius continued to be the major source of FDI during Q1 of 2009-10 
with a share of 48.9 per cent followed by USA at 12.8 per cent. 
(vi) Portfolio investment primarily comprising foreign institutional investorsí (FIIs) 
investments and American Depository Receipts (ADRs)/Global Depository 
Receipts (GDRs) witnessed a sharp turnaround from net outflows of US$ 2.7 
billion in Q4 of 2008-09 to net inflows of US$ 8.3 billion during Q1 of 2009-10. 
During 2009-10, the sharp increase in FII inflows could be attributed to the 
recovery of domestic stock market in line with international stock markets, 
better corporate performance, political stability and comparatively better 
growth prospects. 
(vii) The tightness in liquidity in the overseas markets continued during Q1 of 
2009-10. The approvals of external commercial borrowings (ECBs) were very 
low in the first two months of 2009-10, however, it recovered during June 
2009. In addition, repayments of ECBs were higher at US$ 2.1 billion during 
Q1 of 2009-10 (US$ 1.1 billion during Q1 of 2008-09) resulting in net outflows 
of US$ 0.4 billion under ECBs (inflows of US$ 1.5 billion in Q1 of 2008-09).  11 
 
(viii) The gross disbursements of short-term trade credit was US$ 10.1 billion 
during Q1 of 2009-10 almost same in Q1 of 2008-09. The repayments of 
short-term trade credits, however, were very high at US$ 13.2 billion in Q1 of 
2009-10 (US$ 7.8 billion in Q1 of 2008-09). As a result, there were net 
outflows of US$ 3.1 billion under short-term trade credit during Q1 of 2009-10 
(inflows of US$ 2.4 billion in Q1 of 2008-09). 
(ix) Banking capital mainly consists of foreign assets and liabilities of commercial 
banks. NRI deposits constitute major part of the foreign liabilities. Banking 
capital (net), including NRI deposits, were negative at US$ 3.4 billion during 
Q1 of    2009-10 as against a positive net inflow of US$ 2.7 billion during Q1 
of 2008-09. Among the components of banking capital, NRI deposits 
witnessed higher inflows of US$ 1.8 billion in Q1 of 2009-10 (net inflows of 
US$ 0.8 billion in Q1 of   2008-09) reflecting the positive impact of the 
revisions in the ceiling interest rate on NRI deposits.  
(x) Other capital includes leads and lags in exports, funds held abroad, advances 
received pending for issue of shares under FDI and other capital not included 
elsewhere (n.i.e.). Other capital recorded net outflows of US$ 1.6 billion in Q1 
of 2009-10. The details of other capital are set out in Table 11.

Variation in Reserves 
(i) The increase in foreign exchange reserves on a BoP basis (i.e., excluding 
valuation) was US$ 115 million in Q1 of 2009-10 (as against an accretion to 
reserves of US$ 2,235 million in Q1 of 2008-09) (Table 12 & Chart 5). However, 
the foreign exchange reserves including valuation increased by US$ 13.2 billion 
during Q1 of 2009-10 implying that the increase in reserves during this period 
was mainly due to valuation gains as the US dollar has depreciated against 
major currencies. [A Press Release on the sources of variation in foreign 
exchange reserves is separately issued]. 
(ii) At the end of June 2009, outstanding foreign exchange reserves stood at US$ 
265.1 billion.

(iii) To sum up, the key features of Indiaís BoP that emerged during Q1 of 2009-10 
were:  (i) large trade deficit led by a sharp decline in exports, (ii) net invisibles 
surplus led by remittances from overseas Indians and software services 
exports, (iii) current account deficit of US$ 5.8 billion due to large trade deficit, 
(iv) improvement in net capital inflows mainly supported by large FII and FDI 
inflows, and  (v) a marginal increase in reserves.  
2. Reconciliation of Import Data 
(i) During Q1 of 2009-10, based on the records of Customs imports data released 
by the DGCI&S and the BoP merchandise imports (based on payments basis 
through Authorised Dealers), the difference between the two data sets works 
out to about US$ 13.8 billion which, as per past experience, will narrow down 
subsequently (Table 13).
