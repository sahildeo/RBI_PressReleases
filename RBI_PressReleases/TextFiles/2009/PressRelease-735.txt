Reserve Bank of India releases Monsoon 2008 Issue of its Occasional Papers 
 
 The Reserve Bank of India today released the Monsoon 2008 issue of its 
Reserve Bank of India Occasional Papers, which is a research journal of the 
Reserve Bank and contains contributions of the Bank's staff and reflects the views of 
the authors. This issue is woven around some important themes which are at the 
forefront of policy discussion. It contains articles, special notes and book reviews. 
 
 The first paper titled ‘The Microstructure Approach to Exchange Rate in India: 
Evidence from Technical Trading’ by Rajiv Ranjan, Sarat Dhal and Bhupal Singh, 
explores the role of market microstructure in explaining the short run movement in 
exchange rate in India. The market microstructure pertaining to interdependence of 
intra-day high, low and closing exchange rates is examined within the framework of 
parametric technical trading strategy combined with vector error correction and 
cointegration model (VECM). The paper finds that linkages among these market 
micro structures of exchange rate are associated with demand and supply conditions 
in the foreign exchange market. Closing exchange rate shows more or less 
symmetric response to high and low exchange rates. Market participants seem to be 
bound by a long-run bid-ask spread. Macroeconomic factor such as relating to 
liquidity, foreign interest rate and stock return could have differential impact on the 
daily high, low and close exchange rates. From a policy perspective, these findings 
may contain useful information for the exchange rate management. 
 
 The second paper by Jeevan K. Khundrakpam titled ‘How Persistent is Indian 
Inflationary Process, Has it Changed?’ analyses the nature of inflation persistence in 
India in terms of autoregressive properties and lag response of inflation to systematic 
monetary policy for the period 1982:4 to 2008:3. The paper, based on the 
autoregressive properties of various alternative inflation measures, finds that inflation 
persistence is on the lower side, particularly when allowed for the break in the mean 
of inflation observed around the second half of the 1990s. Among the components of 
WPI, ‘manufacturing’ inflation is found to be the most persistent, while ‘food’ and 
‘fuel’ exhibit a lower level of persistence. Inflation persistence in general also 
declined with the lowering of mean rate of inflation, though some increase was 
observed in the later part of the sample period. The paper observes that the impact 
of money supply on various measures of inflation is positive and had its maximum 
impact with a much longer lag during the higher inflationary period before the mid-
1990s than during the succeeding lower inflationary environment. Interest rate, on 
the other hand, have a negative impact on all the inflation series and, in general, had 
its maximum impact on inflation with a much longer lag than that of change in money 
supply.  2
 
 Under the section on Special Notes, the paper ‘The Inflation Rate in India: Some 
Applied Issues’ by Janak Raj and Sarat Dhal deals with empirical issues pertaining 
to month-over-month and year-on-year wholesale price inflation rate in the Indian 
context by observing their association of with monetary aggregates, output, interest 
rate, and equity prices. The paper finds that while sample means of the two inflation 
rates could not be statistically different from each other the volatility could be 
significantly different, and the persistent in annual inflation rate could be more than 
the monthly inflation rate. The papers also finds the annual inflation rate to fit better 
in models for gauging inflation expectation and persistence, and had stronger 
relationship with monetary aggregates and industrial production than was the case 
with monthly inflation rate. Thus, the paper suggests that the standard year-on-year 
inflation rate could be more useful than the monthly inflation rate for policy analysis.  
 
 The second paper in this section, titled ‘Evolution of the Basel Framework on 
Bank Capital Regulation’ by Anupam Prakash deals with the issue of regulating bank 
capital. The challenges in bank capital regulation posed by the recent global financial 
turmoil have been presented in the backdrop of the major initiatives in the area by 
the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) during the past two decades. 
Basel I, adopted in different countries with certain country-specific adaptations, 
established itself at the core of the assessment of soundness and stability of the 
banking system. However, in view of the deficiencies in the Basel I framework, the 
revised framework (Basel II) was developed by aligning the capital requirements with 
underlying risks through enhanced risk measurement techniques. Basel II evoked 
mixed response in the light of the complexities inherent in the framework. 
Notwithstanding the need to refine and streamline Basel II in the light of recent 
experiences during the global financial turmoil, many experts have emphasized the 
need for faster implementation of Basel II. The issues being re-examined currently 
include inter alia strengthening the risk capture on trading book and off-balance 
sheet exposures, dampening procyclicality, strengthening framework to assess 
liquidity at banks, and globally coordinated supervisory follow-up exercises. With 
financial stability gaining prominence in recent times, these measures need to be 
evaluated in terms of their ability to prevent future crises. The Basel framework on 
capital regulation, thus, continues to evolve in response to the financial innovations 
and other emerging challenges in banking regulation and supervision.
