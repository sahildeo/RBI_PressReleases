RBI Releases Study on ìFinancing Transport Infrastructure and Services in Indiaî 
A Reserve Bank of India study released today - ëFinancing Transport 
Infrastructure and Services in India,í- looks at various options for financing 
infrastructure in the transport sector and argues for market-based financing, within 
prudential limits.  
The authors of the study - Prof. S. Sriraman, University of Mumbai with research 
staff member from the Reserve Bank (Dr. Sunando Roy) ó urge for the need to 
consider access to alternative sources of funds to finance new investment, given the 
tapering of conventional sources of funding from the public sector as well as for the 
maintenance of the transport system. The Study was undertaken under aegis of the 
Development Research Group at the Reserve Bank. 
To address the resource gap from existing transport infrastructural facilities 
provided mostly by the public sector, the study suggests:  
ï Setting user charges (tolls) to economically efficient levels to avoid adverse effects 
of distorted pricing on resource allocation of infrastructure services. 
ï An appropriate tariff strategy as well as better utilisation of existing infrastructure 
and services by enhancing their efficiency. 
ï A Strategy of earmarking for the roads sector since the most attractive feature of 
such a scheme is to link the volume and quality of services (as reflected by 
operating costs) and the user charges (willingness to pay).  
To mobilise additional needed resources, the study makes the following 
suggestions: 
ï Draw on market-based financing as much as possible, while ensuring that 
sustainable/prudential norms are followed.  
ï Promote public-private partnerships. 
ï Support private infrastructure through Government guarantees. But the Government 
must consider the expected value of commitments in issuing guarantees.  
ï The financing mechanism chosen for infrastructure support should encourage 
greater domestic savings for investment rather than diverting resources from other 
investments. 
ï Commercial banks should play the role of ìwholesale financing/bankingî while the 
Non Bank Financing Companies (NBFCs) should play the role of ìretail 
financing/bankingî.   2
ï Financing agencies should (over a period of time) insist on viability of operations 
either as a firm or as an association/co-operative with a viable fleet and requisite 
infrastructure as a pre-requisite for lending to truck operators. Financial innovations 
should be encouraged in the context of transport project financing. 
ï Liberalise investment norms of contractual savings instruments. The demand for 
such funds should be created through a well-planned programme of disinvestment 
of public sector (especially infrastructure) entities promoting private participation in 
infrastructure, reducing budgetary and management obligation and promoting 
competition. Such a supply (of) and demand (for) funds can also contribute to the 
development of the domestic capital market.
