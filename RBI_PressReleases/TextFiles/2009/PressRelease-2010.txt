RBI publishes Special Volume of its 
Reports on Currency & Finance 
The Reserve Bank of India today published its Report on Currency and Finance of the 
last four years - from 2003–2004 to 2006-2008 as a special volume. The special volume of the 
Reports on Currency and Finance brings together the analytical work of the last four Reports 
with the objective of providing greater access to research conducted in the Reserve Bank in 
areas of monetary policy, central banking, financial markets and the banking sector. For the first 
time, the special volume is made available for purchase through Jain Book Agency, C/9, "B" 
Block, Opposite Metro Station, Rajiv Chowk, Connaught Place, New Delhi 110 001 and its 
distributor network. The special volume will also be available in all RBI offices for purchase.   
 The Reserve Bank publishes Report on Currency and Finance every year. Since 1998-
99, the Report has been theme based. So far, eight such thematic reports have been released 
covering several important contemporary issues concerning central banking and macro 
economic aspects relating to India. The last report was released in August 2008. Since the 
themes of the last four editions of the Report on Currency and Finance were on the major 
functional areas of the Reserve Bank, it was considered useful to release the issues of the 
Report on Currency and Finance from 2003-04 to 2006-08 as a special volume. The special 
volume will also supplement the analysis done by the Committee on Financial Sector 
Assessment, the report of which is likely to be published soon.  The Committee on Financial 
Sector Assessment (Chairman: Dr. Rakesh Mohan was constituted in September 2006 to 
undertake a comprehensive self-assessment of the financial sector. The Committee has made 
an objective assessment of India's financial sector based on three mutually reinforcing pillars: 
financial stability and stress testing; legal, infrastructural and market development issues; and 
assessment of the status and implementation of financial standards and codes. 
 The special edition of the Reports on Currency and Finance comprises five volumes: 
The Evolution of Monetary Policy, 2003-04 (Volume I); The Evolution of Central Banking in 
India, 2004-05 (Volume II); Development of Financial Markets and Role of the Central Bank, 
2005-06 (Volume III); and The Banking Sector in India: Emerging Issues and Challenges, 2006-
08 (Volume IV and Volume V).   
Volume I: The Evolution of Monetary Policy  
 The first volume based on the theme 'The Evolution of Monetary Policy' focusses on the 
developments in monetary policy in India since the early 1990s.  The report traces the changes 
in the monetary policy framework in terms of objectives, targets and operating procedures. This 
is followed by a discussion on monetary management in an open economy, especially in view 
of the multiple external shocks impacting the economy during the period of reform. The Report 
then attempts an assessment of the effectiveness of monetary policy in achieving its key 
objectives, viz., inflation and credit availability. Volume II: The Evolution of Central Banking in India 
The second volume covers the theme "The Evolution of Central Banking in India" and 
documents the evolution of central banking in India over its seventy years of existence. 
Volume III: Development of Financial Markets and Role of the Central Bank 
 The third volume focuses on Development of Financial Markets and Role of the Central 
Bank. It covers various segments of financial markets: money, credit, foreign exchange, 
government securities, equity and corporate debt markets and also the whole range of issues 
relating to financial market integration. 
Volumes IV & V: The Banking Sector in India: Emerging Issues and Challenges 
 The fourth and fifth volumes attempt an in-depth analysis of the various aspects of 
Indian banking, such as, management of resource mobilisation; management of risk and 
capital, lending and investment operations of banks; financial inclusion; consolidation and 
competition; efficiency, productivity and soundness; and regulatory and supervisory challenges.
