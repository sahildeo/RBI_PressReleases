RBI to conduct its LAF for Five Days on February 19, 2009 
 
To take care of the possibility that the normal work of the Reserve Bank, 
including the payment and settlement systems, might get disrupted on account of the 
call for mass casual leave given by the United Forum of Reserve Bank Officers and 
Employees, the Reserve Bank has decided to conduct its daily Liquidity Adjustment 
Facility (LAF) auctions tomorrow, i.e., Thursday, February 19, 2009, for five days, due 
for reversal on February 24, 2009.
