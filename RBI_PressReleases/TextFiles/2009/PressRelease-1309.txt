Reserve Bank Cancels the Licence of 
Yashwant Urban Co-operative Bank Ltd., Parbhani, (Maharashtra) 
In view of the fact that Yashwant Urban Co-operative Bank Ltd., Parbhani, 
(Maharashtra) had ceased to be solvent, all efforts to revive it in close consultation with the 
Government of Maharashtra had failed and the depositors of the bank were being 
inconvenienced by continued uncertainty, the Reserve Bank of India delivered the order, 
canceling its licence to the bank after the close of business on April 18, 2009. The Registrar 
of Co-operative Societies, Maharashtra has also been requested to issue an order for 
winding up of the bank and appoint a Liquidator for the bank. It may be highlighted that on 
liquidation every depositor is entitled to repayment of his deposits up to a monetary ceiling 
of Rs.1,00,000/- (Rupees One Lakh only) from the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee 
Corporation (DICGC).    
The bank was granted a licence by Reserve Bank on December 27, 1996 to 
commence banking business. The statutory inspection of the bank conducted by RBI with 
reference to its financial position as on March 31, 2007 revealed that the bank was not 
complying with several provisions of the Banking Regulation Act 1949 (As applicable to 
Cooperative Societies) and its financial position had become precarious. The bank was 
placed under directions under Section 35A of the Banking Regulation Act 1949 (As 
Applicable to Cooperative Societies) vide order dated July 18, 2008 precluding it from 
incurring any liability. 
The Reserve Bank issued a notice to the bank on December 02, 2008 asking it to 
show cause as to why the licence granted to it under Section 22 of the Banking Regulation 
Act, 1949(As Applicable to Cooperative Societies) on December 27, 1996 to conduct 
banking business should not be cancelled. The bank's reply to the show cause notice was 
examined and was found unacceptable. 
As the realizable value of bank's paid-up capital and reserves was negative and the 
chances of its revival were remote in the absence of a viable action plan, the Reserve Bank 
of India took the extreme measure of canceling licence of the bank after examining all 
options for its revival, in the interest of the bank's depositors. With the cancellation of its 
licence and commencement of liquidation proceedings, the process of paying the 
depositors of Yashwant Urban Co-operative Bank Ltd., Parbhani, (Maharashtra), the 
amount insured as per the DICGC Act will be set in motion. 
Consequent to the cancellation of its licence, Yashwant Urban Co-operative Bank 
Ltd., Parbhani, (Maharashtra) is prohibited from carrying on 'banking business' as defined 
in Section 5(b) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949(As Applicable to Cooperative 
Societies) including acceptance and repayment of deposits.   
For any clarifications, depositors may approach Shri Shreedhar Behera, Deputy 
General Manager, Urban Banks Department, Reserve Bank of India, Nagpur. His contact 
details are as below:
