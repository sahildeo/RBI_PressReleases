RBI places on its Website Report of the  
Working Group on Survey for Public Comments 
 
An RBI Working Group on Surveys (Chairman: Shri Deepak Mohanty, 
Executive Director, RBI)  after evaluating the various surveys conducted by the 
Reserve Bank of India, favoured public dissemination of  survey results and 
identified a few new surveys to meet the information requirement for monetary policy 
formulation.  
 
 The key recommendations of the Group on existing and new surveys are: 
 
Existing Surveys 
 
ï Release of the Industrial Outlook Survey results as a one-time article in the 
RBI Bulletin and regular releases thereafter.  
ï As the data quality of the Inflation Expectations Survey has stabilised, the 
Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) on Monetary Policy may consider 
placing the survey in public domain and coverage of the survey may be 
extended to the semi-urban and rural centres.  
ï As the scope and coverage of the Survey of Inventories, Order Books and 
Capacity Utilisation is comprehensive, timeliness of this survey be further 
improved and the results be placed in public domain.  
ï The Reserve Bank of India should expedite setting up of an asset price 
monitoring system to have relevant information on real estate prices.  
ï Compilation of the Housing Start-up Index, which is an important lead 
indicator of economic activity, should be expedited. 
ï Reviewing the Basic Statistical Returns (BSR) System which provides 
transaction data on banking, all publications based on BSR 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 
should be brought out within a year from the reference period.  
 New Surveys 
ï A  Consumer Confidence Survey may be initiated by the Reserve Bank of 
India as the changes in household confidence on economic and personal 
financial situation have implications for real economic activity. 
ï Keeping in view the international experience, a Credit Conditions Survey may 
be conducted by the Reserve Bank of India  on a quarterly basis, covering the 
large lenders from among the commercial banks.  
 2 
 
ï A  Business Outlook Survey for Services Sector may be conducted, initially 
with a focus on the trading sector.    
ï Reserve Bank of India may explore the possibilities with the National Sample 
Survey Organisation (NSSO) to conduct inter-decadal All India Debt and 
Investment Survey (AIDIS) -type thin-sample survey to assess changes in 
rural and urban indebtedness on a more frequent basis.  
 
       The Report has been placed on the RBI website www.rbi.org.in for wider 
dissemination and comments. Comments may please be sent by post to The 
Director, Survey Division, Department of Statistics and Information Management, 
Reserve Bank of India,  C-8/9 Bandra Kurla Complex, Mumbai- 400051 or by  fax   to
