increase the notified amounts of T-Bills as indicated above, with effect from the second

The Reserve Bank of India/Government of India will continue to have the 
flexibility to modify the notified amount and timing for auction of Treasury Bills keeping 
in view the emerging requirements of the Government, market conditions and other 
relevant factors. The calendar is thus subject to change, if circumstances so warrant, 
including for reasons, such as, intervening holidays. Such changes, if any, will be 
communicated through regular press releases. 
The auction of Treasury bills will be subject to the terms and conditions specified 
in the General Notification No. F 2(12)-W&M/97, dated March 31, 1998 issued by the 
Government of India, as amended from time to time.
