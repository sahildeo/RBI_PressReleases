Beware of Fictitious Offers/Lottery Winnings/Cheap Fund Offers: RBI 
  The Reserve Bank of India has, today once again clarified that remittance in any 
form towards participation in lottery schemes is prohibited under the Foreign Exchange 
Management Act, 1999. Further, these restrictions are applicable also to remittances 
for participation in lottery-like schemes functioning under different names, such as, 
money circulation scheme or remittances for the purpose of securing prize money / 
awards, etc. The Reserve Bank has clarified that it neither maintains any account in the 
name of individuals / companies / trusts in India to hold funds for disbursal nor does it 
allow individuals to open an account to deposit money with the Reserve Bank.  It also 
does not issue any certificates or advices or confirmations, evidencing receipt and 
holding of money in these accounts.   
The Reserve Bank has advised the public not to remit or deposit money in such 
accounts in response to fictitious offers/representations. The public may immediately 
bring the details of such offers to the notice of local police authorities for booking the 
culprits.   
 The Reserve Bank advice came in the wake of many residents falling prey to 
such tempting offers and losing money in the recent past.  
The Reserve Bank of India has, on several occasions in the past, cautioned the 
members of public not to fall prey to fictitious offers / lottery winnings / remittance of 
cheap funds in foreign currency from abroad by certain foreign entities / individuals, 
including Indian residents acting as representatives of such entities / individuals. These 
offers are generally made through letters, e-mails, mobile phones, SMSs, etc.   
 The Reserve Bank of India has stated that in addition to the typical modalities 
adopted in the past, the fraudsters have now resorted to issuing certificates, letters, 
circulars, etc., on letterhead that looks like that of the Reserve Bank of Indiaís and 
purportedly signed by its executives / senior officials to make such offers look genuine. 
The fraudsters also convince the victims by impersonating as senior officials of the 
Reserve Bank with telephone numbers and/or fictitious e-mail IDs. Many fraudsters 
have even opened accounts with banks in India and advised public to deposit money in 
these accounts towards various charges, taxes, duties, etc. Once the money is 
deposited in their account, people mailing such offers withdraw the money and then 
vanish. The victim thus loses the money already paid.  
The Reserve Bank has also urged members of public to read the ticker on the 
Reserve Bankís website (www.rbi.org.in) for details.
