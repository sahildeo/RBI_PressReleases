RBI Board meets today at Bengaluru 
The Central Board of the Reserve Bank of India met today at Bengaluru.  The 
meeting reviewed key economic, monetary and financial developments and the 
various steps taken by the Reserve Bank to preserve financial stability and arrest the 
moderation in growth momentum in the context of the recession in major economies 
of the world. Dr. D. Subbarao, Governor, Reserve Bank of India chaired the meeting. 
The  following members were present in the meeting of the Central Board: 
Shri Y.H. Malegam, Prof U.R. Rao, Shri Lakshmi Chand,  Shri H.P. Ranina,           
Dr. Ashok Ganguly,  Smt.  Shashi  Rajagopalan,  Dr. A. Vaidyanathan,                   
Prof M. M. Sharma,  Shri Sanjay Labroo and Shri Ashok Chawla, Finance Secretary, 
Government of India. Deputy Governors of the Reserve Bank, Dr. Rakesh Mohan, 
Smt. Shyamala Gopinath and Smt. Usha Thorat were also present. 
 The Central Board of Directors of the Reserve Bank meets at least once 
every quarter. The Board has scheduled meetings in Mumbai, Chennai and Kolkata 
each year. The post-budget meeting of the Board, traditionally held in New Delhi, is 
addressed by the Union Finance Minister. The other meetings of the Board are held 
in the remaining state capitals by rotation. The main function of the Central Board of 
the Reserve Bank is to provide overall direction to its affairs. 
Prior to the meeting of the Central Board of the RBI, the Governor called on 
Shri B. S. Yeddyurappa, the Honíble Chief Minister of Karnataka. A significant 
decision taken at the meeting was to launch a pilot programme for financial literacy 
in the State of Karnataka. This programme, to be launched by the RBI in 
collaboration with the State Government, will involve introduction of financial and 
related material in the curriculum of its schools and colleges. Steps will also be taken 
to make financial literacy part of non-formal education. In the meeting the Chief 
Minister stressed the importance of cooperation of banks for increasing the flow of 
credit to agriculture and weaker sections. The Chief Minister also emphasised that 
the flow of education loans was unsatisfactory. He requested the Governor to speak 
to the banks to cooperate with the State Government in making its development 
programmes successful. 
Subsequently, the Governor had a meeting with the senior officials of the State 
Government, commercial banks and financial institutions represented in Karnataka, 
to discuss the State-specific issues relating to banking.  Pursuant to the deliberations 
at the meeting, the following decisions were taken: 
a) All villages in Karnataka with a population of more than 2000 would be 
targeted for 100% financial inclusion to secure voluntary and involuntary 
financial inclusion by March 31, 2010;  2
 
b) All households across all villages in Karnataka which have been issued photo 
identity cards by the State Government will be covered under the financial 
inclusion programme through opening of ìno frillsî accounts by March 31, 
2010; 
c) In order to focus on the quality of financial inclusion, at least 50% of all the ìno 
frillsî accounts existing as on March 31, 2009 will be made active by March 
31, 2010; 
d) A special SLBC meeting will be convened dedicated to address various 
issues in grant of education loans with a view to streamlining the procedures 
and systems including those relating to grant of interest subvention for 
education loans by the State Government, so as to be ready for handling the 
rush of the education loan applications for the ensuing academic session; 
e) The SLBC will have a meeting with the MSME associations to identify and 
understand the issues in implementing the RBI requirement of earmarking a 
subñlimit, in the credit facilities extended to large corporates, towards 
payment of dues of the MSEs; 
f) All issues relating to Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) for effecting payments 
to beneficiaries of NREGA Scheme, pension, etc., in the State of Karnataka 
shall be resolved so as to EBT in full shape by August 15, 2009.
