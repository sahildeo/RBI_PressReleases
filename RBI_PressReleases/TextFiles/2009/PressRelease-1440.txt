RBI Announces OMO Programme for  
Purchases of Government Securities and 
Unwinding of MSS Securities 
 
In recent months, the Reserve Bank has been conducting purchase of 
government securities under its open market operations (OMO) through an auction-
based mechanism in addition to operations through the NDS-OM for more effective 
liquidity management. The Reserve Bank also announced in its Press Release of 
March 4, 2009 that such operations would be conducted as warranted by the 
evolving monetary and financial market conditions.  
 
In the first half of 2009-10, the expected unwinding of MSS securities would 
be of Rs.42,000 crore comprising Rs.33,000 crore of dated securities and Rs.9,000 
crore of Treasury Bills. Keeping this and other factors in view, the Reserve Bank 
intends to purchase government securities under its open market operations in the 
amount of Rs.80,000 crore in the first half (April-September) of 2009-10. Of this, 
purchase of government securities of Rs.40,000 crore is envisaged for the first 
quarter (April-June) of 2009-10. MSS unwinding in the first quarter is expected to be 
of the order of Rs. 37,500 crore comprising Rs. 33,000 crore of dated securities and 
Rs. 4,500 crore of Treasury Bills.  
 
OMO purchase auctions would normally be conducted every alternate week 
on Thursdays. The first purchase auction, however, will be conducted on 
Wednesday, April 8, 2009. The Reserve Bank maintains the right to alter the 
frequency and day of auction as may be necessary according to market conditions.  
 
The OMO amounts are indicative and the Reserve Bank will have the 
flexibility to make changes in the amount of OMO depending on the evolving liquidity 
conditions and its other operations. The Reserve Bank on its part would continue to 
maintain ample liquidity in the system.
