RBI's Special Fixed Rate Term Repo Auction for Rs. 59,300 Crore Today 
The Reserve Bank of India shall conduct a special fixed rate term repo at 5.5 per 
cent per annum against eligible securities for Rs.59,300 crore on February 13, 2009, 
due for reversal on February 27, 2009, with a view to enabling banks to meet the 
liquidity requirements of Mutual Funds (MFs), Non-Banking Financial Companies 
(NBFCs) and Housing Finance Companies (HFCs) either on incremental or on rollover 
basis. The outstanding amount under this facility as on February 12, 2009 stood at 
Rs.700 crore. 
It may be recalled that the Reserve Bank of India had announced earlier that it 
would conduct the special fixed rate term repo under Liquidity Adjustment Facility daily 
till June 30, 2009 up to a cumulative amount of Rs.60,000 crore on outstanding basis 
and that additional liquidity support to the extent of up to 1.5 per cent of their NDTL, can 
be availed by banks exclusively for the purpose of meeting requirements of MFs, 
NBFCs and HFCs. It has now been decided to extend this facility up to September 30, 
2009.
