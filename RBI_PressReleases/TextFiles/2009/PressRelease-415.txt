Liquidity Management during FY 2009-10 
It may be recalled that since February 19, 2009, the Reserve Bank has been 
buying government securities under its open market operations (OMO) through an 
auction-based mechanism for more effective liquidity management. In this context, 
on March 26, 2009, the Reserve Bank had announced its intention to purchase an 
indicative amount of Rs 80,000 crore under its open market operations during the 
first half (April-September) of 2009-10. During the first half of the current fiscal year, 
the Reserve Bank has purchased Government securities amounting to Rs 57,487 
crore through the auction route.  
The Reserve Bank would conduct open market operations during the second 
half of the current fiscal year as and when considered necessary.
