The Government of Jammu & Kashmir and the Reserve Bank of India have, on

Jammu & Kashmir. Shri Arnab Roy, Regional Director for Jammu & Kashmir, Reserve 
Bank of India, is the Chairman of the TAFCUB and Shri G. N. Sufi, Registrar of Co-op.

Uttaranchal, Chattisgarh, Goa, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Mizoram, Manipur, Assam, 
Meghalaya, Himachal Pradesh, Sikkim, Union Territory of Puduchery, NCT of Delhi,

1714 UCBs are covered under MOU, i.e. 99.6% of total number of UCBs accounting for 
99.8% of total deposits of the sector. 
As part of its developmental role, the Reserve Bank would also be assessing the 
training, computerisation needs of the Urban Co-operative Banks in the State of Jammu 
& Kashmir with the objective of upgrading their human resources skills and 
technological infrastructure so that they improve their operational efficiency and quality 
of management information systems. 
It may be recalled that in the Mid-Term Review of Annual Policy announced in 
October 2004, the Reserve Bank had announced that a vision document for Urban Co-
operative Banks would be prepared. Accordingly, the Reserve Bank placed in public 
domain a draft vision document in March 2005. As the Urban Co-operative Banks are 
subject to dual control by the Reserve Bank and the State Governments, the vision 
document envisaged the signing of MoU between State Governments and the Reserve 
Bank of India to put in place an arrangement through which there is a convergence on 
the approach and remedial actions required to be taken for facilitating the development 
of the sector. The vision document also proposed the constitution of a State Level Task 
Force of Urban Co-operative Banks with representatives of State Government, 
State/National Federation of Urban Cooperative Banks and the Reserve Bank of India 
as its members, for the purpose of identifying the potentially viable urban co-op. banks 
and drawing up a time-bound action plan for their revival by setting specific monitorable 
milestones.
