De-sequestering of MSS Balances 
 
In view of its comfortable cash position, the Government of India, in consultation 
with the Reserve Bank of India, have now decided not to transfer the balance amount of 
Rs.33,000 crore from the MSS cash account to the normal cash account of the 
Government of India in the current fiscal year. Based on the emerging fund 
requirements of the Government, Rs.33,000 crore of MSS will be de-sequestered 
against the approved market borrowing programme or bought back in the fiscal year 
2009-10.  
 
It may be recalled that following the amendment to the Memorandum of 
Understanding on the Market Stabilisation Scheme (MSS), it was decided that an 
amount of Rs.45,000 crore would be transferred in installments from the MSS cash 
account to the normal cash account of the Government of India by March 31, 2009. An 
equivalent amount of Government securities were to accordingly form part of the 
normal borrowing of the Government of India. In this regard, an amount of Rs.12,000 
crore was transferred from the MSS cash account to the normal cash account of the 
Government of India on March 4, 2009. 
 
The MSS outstanding as on March 31, 2009 is Rs.88,773 crore (Face Value).
