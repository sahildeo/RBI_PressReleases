useful forum for interactions among the State Finance Secretaries, senior officials of the

Reserve Bank of India. The State Finance Secretaries play a key role in the 
development process of their respective States and strive to achieve transparency, 
stability, fairness and efficiency in the conduct of fiscal policies. The deliberations in the

of better financial management and fiscal prudence in the States. 
 
Today's Conference aimed to take this consultative process further. Apart from 
operational issues pertaining to the Government transactions, the discussions in the 
Conference primarily focused on issues relating to surplus cash balances of the State 
Governments, projections on market borrowings of the States, advance planning for 
borrowing by the States, imparting liquidity to the State Development Loans by 
reissuance and consolidation, electronic benefit transfer to the beneficiaries of the 
social security assistance of the governments, impact of counter cyclical fiscal 
measures taken by the States, etc.
