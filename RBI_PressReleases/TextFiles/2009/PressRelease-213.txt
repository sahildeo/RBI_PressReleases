Reserve Bank Cancels the Licence of Rajlaxmi Nagari Sahakari Bank Ltd., Dhule, 
District Dhule, Maharashtra 
In view of the fact that Rajlaxmi Nagari Sahakari Bank Ltd., Dhule, District Dhule 
Maharashtra had ceased to be solvent, all efforts to revive it in close consultation with 
the Government of Maharashtra had failed and the depositors were being 
inconvenienced by continued uncertainty, the Reserve Bank of India delivered the order 
cancelling its licence to the bank after the close of business on October 27, 2009. The 
Registrar of Co-operative Societies, Maharashtra has also been requested to issue an 
order for winding up the bank and appoint a liquidator for the bank. It may be 
highlighted that on liquidation, every depositor is entitled to repayment of his/her 
deposits up to a monetary ceiling of Rs. 1,00,000/- (Rupees One lakh only) from the 
Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) under usual terms and 
conditions.  
The bank was granted a licence to function as a co-operative bank by Reserve 
Bank on June 30, 1997. The statutory inspection of the bank with reference to its 
financial position as on March 31,2009 revealed that the position of the bank was 
precarious. The Reserve Bank of India issued directions under Section 35-A of the 
Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (As applicable to Co-operative Societies) vide Directive 
UBD.CO.NSB-I.No.D-40/12.22.469/2008-09 dated May 06, 2009 restricting its 
operations.  
The Reserve Bank of India issued a notice to the bank on May 12, 2009 asking it 
to show cause as to why the licence granted to it to conduct banking business should 
not be cancelled. The reply to the show cause notice was examined and it was 
observed that the bank did not have any viable plan of action for its revival.  
In the absence of any viable proposal for turnaround and achieve the required 
regulatory prescriptions, the possibility of revival of the bank was remote. Therefore, the 
Reserve Bank of India took the extreme measure of cancelling licence of the bank in 
the interest of the bank's depositors. With the cancellation of its licence and 
commencement of liquidation proceedings, the process of paying the depositors of 
Rajlaxmi Nagari Sahakari Bank Ltd., Dhule District Dhule, Maharashtra will be set in 
motion subject to the terms and conditions of the Deposit Insurance Scheme.  
Consequent to the cancellation of its licence, Rajlaxmi Nagari Sahakari Bank 
Ltd., Dhule, District Dhule, Maharashtra is prohibited from carrying on ëbanking 
businessí as defined in Section 5(b) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (AACS) 
including acceptance and repayment of deposits.

Manager, Urban Banks Department, Mumbai Regional Office, Reserve Bank of India, 
Mumbai. His contact details are as below:
