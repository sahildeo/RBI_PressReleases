Sources of Variation in Foreign Exchange  
Reserves in India: April-September 2009-10 
 
Earlier today, the Reserve Bank of India released the Balance of Payments 
(BoP) data for Q2 of 2009-10 (July-September 2009) on its website (www.rbi.org.in). 
On the basis of these data along with the revised data for earlier quarters, this note on 
sources of variation in foreign exchange reserves during April-September 2009 has 
been compiled. 
 
Sources of Variation in Foreign Exchange Reserves: April-September 2009 
 
During April-September 2009, there was an accretion to foreign exchange 
reserves mainly on account of valuation changes. Also, inflows under foreign 
investments and Non-Resident Indian deposits and SDR allocations by the IMF have 
contributed to the increase in foreign exchange reserves during April-September 2009. 
The sources of variation in the foreign exchange reserves are set out in Table 1.

On balance of payments basis (i.e., excluding valuation effects), the foreign 
exchange reserves increased by US$ 9,533 million during April-September 2009 as 
against a decline of US$ 2,499 million during April-September 2008. The valuation gain, 
reflecting the depreciation of the US dollar against the major currencies, accounted for 
US$ 19,760 million during April-September 2009 as compared with a valuation loss of 
US$ 20,888 million during April-September 2008. Accordingly, valuation gain during 
April-September 2009 accounts for 67.5 per cent of the total increase in foreign 
exchange reserves.  
 
The IMF made additional allocations of SDRs to India in two tranche viz., general 
allocation of SDR 3,082 million (equivalent to US$ 4,821 million) on August 28, 2009 
and a special allocation of SDR 214.6 million (equivalent to US$ 340 million) on 
September 9, 2009. This has raised the Indiaís foreign exchange reserves by US$ 
5,161 million during the quarter.
