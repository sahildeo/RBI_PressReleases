Statistics Day Conference - July 2, 2009 
 
As a part of the Platinum Jubilee celebration, the Reserve Bank of India 
organised the Statistics Day Conference 2009 on July 2, 2009. Statistics Day marks 
the birth anniversary of Prof. P. C. Mahalanobis, the legendary statistician who 
contributed enormously on the development of statistics and statistical 
infrastructure in the country. Several distinguished speakers viz., Prof. T. N. 
Srinivasan, Prof. J.K. Ghosh, Prof. Arijit Choudhuri and Dr. Wilbert van der Klaauw 
spoke on the occasion at length on topics relevant for data collection system in the 
central bank.   
 
Recounting the value of immense contributions of Prof. P. C. Mahalanobis in 
Statistics, Dr. D. Subbarao, Governor, Reserve Bank of India in his inaugural 
address highlighted the relevance and importance of statistics, statistical analysis 
and in, particular, the role of sample surveys in central bank activities. He 
emphasized that relevance and effectiveness of RBIís policy judgments crucially 
depend on the quality of data, the efficacy of analysis and interpretation. In the 
context of open economies and improvement in communication, Governor stressed 
managing expectations and perceptions better by focusing attention on data 
standards and improving quality of statistics education. Among the problems of 
statistics confounding RBI, he emphasized the issues relating to data revision, 
inflation measurement, information on leading indicators for business cycles and 
financial soundness indicator, and lack of availability of employment data. For 
example, Governor stated that as divergence in inflation based on different 
measures complicate the conduct of monetary policy, RBI considers all the 
measures of inflation, both overall and disaggregated components, in conjunction 
with other economic indicators underlying inflation process.   
 
Prof. T. N. Srinivasan, Samuel C Park Jr. Professor in Economics, Yale 
University, US in his keynote address highlighted the importance of sample surveys, 
cross checking and validation of data, issues relating to data quality and policy. He 
acknowledged that empirical and theoretical contributions of Prof. Mahalanobis to 
statistics are of pioneering nature and there is no parallel to this in any developing 
country. Prof J K Ghosh, Purdue University, US, and former director of Indian 
Statistical Institute indicated the usefulness of the advanced knowledge of statistics 
including Bayesian statistics, for achieving a scientific solution to all practical 
problems.  
 
As successful implementation of policies, particularly in deregulated 
environment, needs to be backed by collection of requisite information through 
surveys, the conference had special sessions on ësurveys in central banksí. While 
Prof. Arijit Chaudhuri, Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata talked on latest 
methodological development on survey sampling, Dr. Wilbert van der Klaauw of 
Federal Reserve Bank of New York presented the research findings aimed at 
improving survey measures of inflation expectations. He argued in favour of going 
beyond direct measurement and focused on the way households form and update  2
their expectations, and the links between inflation expectations and consumer 
behaviour.  
 
In his valedictory address, Shri Deepak Mohanty, Executive Director, 
mentioned that the Bank has over the past few years initiated a number of surveys 
to capture timely information on major leading indicators of economic activity. The 
results of these surveys are used internally for policy purposes. In this context, 
presently a Working Group is reviewing the scope, quality and coverage of these 
surveys with a view to placing them in public domain. While the Database on Indian 
Economy (DBIE) is available on RBI website, efforts are made to make available the 
Handbook of Statistics on Indian Economy, a flagship publication of the RBI, on real 
time basis in this Platinum Jubilee year.
