Report on Trend and Progress of Banking in India 2008-09 
The Reserve Bank of India today released its Report on Trend and Progress of 
Banking in India, 2008-09. This statutory Report, published yearly, provides a detailed 
account of policy developments and performance of commercial banks, co-operative 
banks, and non-banking financial institutions during 2008-09.  This yearís report is more 
analytical and consise, while ensuring the continuity in crucial data and information 
dissemination. 
2008-09 has been a testing year for the Indian financial system against the 
backdrop of one of the worst global financial crisis witnessed so far. The Report 
presents a detailed analysis of the Indian financial system from the financial stability 
viewpoint. Based on latest available information, the Report observes that the Indian 
financial system in general, and banking system in particular, have withstood the 
adverse effects of the crisis and remained robust and resilient. Though the international 
economic slowdown had its impact on the Indian economy, the banking sector in India 
was relatively immune from the crisis, as the exposure of Indian banking system to toxic 
assets was minimal. More importantly, the Reserve Bankís initiatives regarding 
adoption of counter-cyclical prudential regulations framework, both during credit boom 
period as well as during the slowdown, assumed significance.  
The Report has seven chapters: (i) Perspectives, (ii) Global Banking 
Developments, (iii) Policy Environment, (iv) Operations and Performance of 
Commercial Banks, (v) Developments in Cooperative Banking, (vi) Non-Banking 
Financial Institutions and (vii) Financial Stability. The Report has detailed statistical 
appendices that provide data on various indicators of performance of the financial 
sector during the year.  
Key findings of the chapters in the Report are included below. 
Perspectives 
ï Financial innovation and integration have increased the speed and extent to 
which shocks are transmitted across asset classes and countries, blurring 
boundaries between systemic and non-systemic institutions. But regulation and 
supervision have remained geared toward individual financial institutions. The 
regulatory mechanisms do not adequately consider the systemic and 
international implications of domestic institutionsí actions (para 1.2; page 1). 
ï Three groups of mutually reinforcing factors that did not receive adequate 
attention from regulators and monetary authorities arguably contributed to 
increased systemic risk. First, global macroeconomic imbalances resulted in 
lower interest rates during the past decade, inducing more risk-taking and 
contributing to the creation of asset price bubbles worldwide. Second, changes 
in financial sector structure and the failure of risk management to keep up with  2
financial innovation - the trend towards securitisation, including the importance of 
the shadow banking system - during the past two decades rendered the system 
more prone to instability. Finally, leveraged financial institutions have inherent 
incentives to take on excessive risks without internalising systemic risk, which is 
the main reason they need to be regulated (para 1.4; page 2). 
ï Action is needed in at least four areas to reduce the risk of crises and address 
them when they occur. These are (a) finding a better way to assess systemic risk 
and prevent its buildup in good times; (b) improving transparency and disclosure 
of risks being taken by various market participants; (c) expanding cross-
institutional and cross-border scope of regulation while safeguarding constructive 
diversity; and (d) putting in place mechanisms for more effective, coordinated 
actions. Several areas that require attention to prevent systemic crises are: 
perimeter of regulation (which institutions should be within regulatory purview), 
pro-cyclical practices, information gaps (about risks and where it is distributed in 
the financial system), harmonization of national and regulatory practices, and 
providing liquidity to markets (para 1.5-1.6 ; page 2).  
ï The chapter discusses the reforms proposed in the area of international financial 
architecture: first, increase in the resources and revision of the instruments of the 
international financial institutions, and second, strengthening the international 
financial system (para 1.25; page 8).  
ï While there is a lot to learn from the global perspectives as also from several 
global initiatives, many of the Indian banking practices are worth emulating by 
other countries. The Indian banking is a success story in the midst of the global 
crisis owing primarily to the regulatory environment in place and the structural 
banking drivers. The levels of banking penetration are presently low. Looking 
forward, the tremendous potential from greater financial inclusion provide a 
favourable banking outlook (para 1.76 ; page 22).  
Global Banking Developments 
ï The deterioration in the global outlook that started in the middle of 2008 
continued through the second quarter of 2009, although some tentative signs of 
stabilisation have begun to emerge. According to the World Economic Outlook, 
October 2009, the IMF has projected the global economy to shrink by 1.1 per 
cent in 2009, a shade lower than the contraction of 1.3 per cent projected in April 
2009.  The global economy is, however, projected to recover and expand by 3.1 
per cent in 2010 (para 2.3 ; page 25).  
ï The global financial markets that remained under stress till Q1:2009, witnessed 
reduction in volatility and risk spreads in Q2:2009 and early part of Q3: 2009 and 
moderation in credit default swaps. A series of policy induced measures 
contributed to waning of market uncertainty and helped to stabilise the financial 
markets. These include steps by the central banks to ease monetary conditions, 
the action plan of the G-20 announced in April 2009, publication of the specific 
rescue package plans for banks, particularly in the US and the UK, and the 
release of the results of US Fedís bank stress-tests based action plan (para 2.7 ; 
page 27).  
ï In the second half of 2008, the financial crisis resulted in a decline in the total 
notional amounts outstanding of over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives to $592 
trillion at end-year, an indication of reduced market activity. This is the first 
decline since 1998. Foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives markets both 
recorded their first significant contractions (para 2.16 ; page 31).  3
ï The profitability of banks plunged last year owing to the realisation of losses on 
marked to market (securities) portfolios and the progressive deterioration of loan 
books as the economic slump deepened. The impact of the crisis has been 
severe as evident from the quantum of bank losses. As per the BIS estimate, 
losses for the year 2008 worked out to US$731.8 billion, while those for the first 
quarter of 2009 have been estimated to be US$93.7 billion (para 2.28 ; page 36).  
ï Notwithstanding the critical financial sector rescue programmes, over the 
medium and long-term, the global banking sector outlook remains weak on both 
the sides of the Atlantic. The global economy is slated to recover during 2010, 
which may facilitate revival of the global banking system (para 2.35 ; page 38). 
Policy Environment 
ï In the wake of the global financial crisis, the initiatives taken by the Reserve 
Bank were mainly aimed at strengthening the banking system and financial 
markets, while ensuring uninterrupted flow of credit to the different sectors of the 
economy. The stance of monetary policy underwent a shift from monetary 
tightening in the first half of 2008-09 reflecting the response to rising inflationary 
expectations to aggressive monetary easing in the second half using multiple, 
conventional and unconventional tools so as to minimise the impact of global 
crisis on India. Accordingly, the major policy initiatives taken by the Reserve 
Bank were aimed at providing ample rupee liquidity, ensuring comfortable dollar 
liquidity and maintaining a market environment conducive for the continued flow 
of credit to productive sectors. Measures aimed at expanding rupee liquidity 
included significant reduction in the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) and Statutory 
Liquidity Ratio (SLR), a special repo window under the liquidity adjustment 
facility (LAF) for banks for on-lending to non-banking financial companies, 
housing finance companies and mutual funds, and a special refinance facility 
that banks could access without any collateral (paras 3.4 - 3.21 ; pages 44-48).  
ï The repo rate under the Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) was increased by 
125 points from 7.75 per cent in April 2008 to 9.0 per cent by end-July 2008. In 
the subsequent period, however, it was reduced by 425 basis points to 4.75 per 
cent by April 2009. The reverse repo rate was also reduced by 275 basis points 
from 6.00 per cent in November 2008 to 3.25 per cent by April 2009. The CRR 
for scheduled banks was increased by 125 basis points from 7.75 per cent of the 
net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) of banks on April 26, 2008 to 9.00 per 
cent on August 30, 2008 but was subsequently reduced by 400 basis points 
during 2008-09 to 5.00 per cent of NDTL by January 17, 2009. 
ï In order to channelise the credit to productive sectors of the economy, the major 
policy initiatives by the Reserve Bank during 2008-09 were inter alia the 
following: (i)  widening priority sector lending by inclusion of loans to Housing 
Finance Companies; (ii) simplifying the procedure for extending loans to 
agriculture and allied activities to make its implementation easier; (iii) 
announcing further reliefs under the Agriculture Debt Waiver Scheme, 2008. The 
Reserve Bank also modified the facility of temporary liquidity support for 
financing agricultural operations.  
ï To intensify the on-going financial inclusion process, the Reserve Bank prepared 
a model scheme on Financial Literacy and Credit Counseling Center, reviewed 
the Lead Bank Scheme and the banking correspondent (BC)/banking facilitator 
(BF) model, widened the entities those can be engaged as BCs, and requested  4
the banks to provide banking services nearer to the no-frill account holders, 
among others (paras 3.48 - 3.67 ; pages 56-65). 
ï As part of prudential regulations, the Reserve Bank laid down a timeframe for 
implementation of advanced approaches under Basel II for Scheduled 
Commercial Banks (SCBs). The banks are also advised to undertake an internal 
assessment of their preparedness for migration to advanced approaches, in the 
light of the criteria envisaged in the Basel II document. In the wake of heightened 
concerns of financial stability, the regulatory initiatives by the Reserve Bank 
during the year continued to focus on adapting the international best practices.  
ï In August 2008, the Reserve Bank issued the revised guidelines on restructuring 
of advances by banks. While the Reserve Bank advised the banks that they 
were to restructure the accounts of viable entities classified under ëstandardí, 
ësub-standardí and ëdoubtfulí categories, it clarified that the banks cannot 
restructure these accounts with retrospective effect. The Reserve Bank extended 
the exceptional/special regulatory treatment to all the accounts which were 
standard as on September 1, 2008.  
Operations and Performance of Commercial Banks 
ï The Scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs) in India remained largely robust 
against the backdrop of global financial crisis (paras 4.1 - 4.2 ; page 105).  
ï There was a slowdown in the rate of growth of deposits of SCBs during 2008-09; 
the growth in deposits decelerated to 22.4 per cent as at end-March 2009 from 
23.1 per cent as at end March 2008 (para 4.13, page 108). Among the non-
deposit resources, the growth in borrowings by banks decelerated to 6.8 per cent 
as at end-March 2009 from 24.5 per cent in the previous year (para 4.16 , page 
109).  
ï The growth rate of credit of SCBs, which was as high as 33.2 per cent during 
2004-05 has been witnessing a slowdown since then. In continuation of the 
trend, the growth rate in bank credit decelerated to 21.2 per cent during 2008-09 
from 25.0 per cent in the previous year. Apart from cyclical factors which led to 
slowdown in growth after a period of high credit growth, the deceleration in bank 
credit growth was accentuated this year due to the overall slowdown in the 
economy in the aftermath of global financial turmoil.  
ï Growth rate of investments by banks decelerated to 23.1 per cent during 2008-
09. However SLR securities as percentage of NDTL increased during the year 
due to banksí preference to park their funds in low risk and low return 
instruments against the backdrop of prevailing uncertainties (para 4.33, page 
115).  
ï The off-balance sheet operations of the SCBs, which include forward exchange 
contracts, guarantees, among others, have increased manifold in the recent 
years. The year 2008-09 however, marked an exception to this trend with SCBs 
reducing their OBS exposures by 26.4 per cent as compared to last year (para 
4.47, page 121).   
ï The growth rates of income as well as expenditure of SCBs decelerated, leading 
to deceleration in growth of net profits from 36.9 per cent in 2007-08 to 23.5 per 
cent in 2008-09 (paras 4.53 - 4.60 ; pages 123-126). 
ï The Return on Assets (ROA) remained at last yearís level of 1.0 per cent. 
Significantly, the Return on Equity (ROE) increased to 13.3 per cent during 
2008-09 from 12.5 per cent during 2007-08, indicating increased efficiency with  5
which capital is used by the banks. Thus, though the expansion of the balance 
sheet moderated, the asset quality was maintained (para 4.65 - 4.66 ; page 127).  
ï The Capital to Risk-Weighted Assets Ratio (CRAR) of SCBs improved to 13.2 
per cent as at end-March 2009 from 13.0 per cent as at end-March 2008 (para 
4.79 ; page 133). 
ï The gross NPA to gross advances ratio of SCBs remained at the last yearís level 
of 2.3 per cent as at end-March 2009 (para 4.72 ; page 129). The gross NPA 
ratio of public sector banks declined but that of private and foreign banks 
increased during the year. 
Developments in Cooperative Banking 
ï The process of consolidation in the urban cooperative banking (UCB) sector  
continued during the year 2008-09. As a fallout of this process, there was a 
sustained decline in the percentage of weak/sick banks belonging to Grade III/IV 
from 28.0 per cent in 2008 to 22.8 per cent in 2009 (page 159).  
ï There was an increase in the concentration of the banking business in few large 
entities within the UCB sector. This was evident from the fact that at end-March 
2009, UCBs having deposits base of more than Rs. 1,000 crore had a share of 
33.6 per cent in the total deposits of UCBs at end-March 2009 as compared to 
28.8 per cent at end-March  2008 (para 5.12 , page 161).  
ï During the year, there has been a continued expansion in the business of UCBs 
as evident from a high growth in loans and advances as well as deposits 
signaling a growing public confidence in these institutions. The rate of growth of 
deposits and credit stood at 13.5 per cent and 8.3 per cent, respectively during 
2008-09 (para 5.17, page 163).  
ï Notwithstanding the slowdown in the rate of growth of net profits of the UCB 
sector to 14.9 per cent during 2008-09 from 29.6 per cent during 2007-08, it is 
noteworthy that the UCB sector has consistently posted positive growth during 
the last two years (para 5.23 ; page 165).  
ï Notwithstanding the slowdown in economic activity and expectations about 
higher loan defaults following the global crisis, there was a decline in the (gross) 
NPA ratio in UCB sector from 15.5 per cent at end-March 2008 to 13.3 per cent 
at end-March 2009 reflecting the growing financial soundness of this sector.  
ï For short and long-term rural credit cooperatives, the NPA ratio at end-March 
2008 ranged between 12.8 per cent and 53.7 per cent (para 5.44 ; page 174).  
ï All rural cooperatives except State Cooperative Banks (StCBs) have reported 
overall losses during 2007-08 (para 5.43 , page 173).  
Non-Banking Financial Institutions 
ï As part of the measures taken by the Reserve Bank in view of the financial 
stress faced by NBFCs following the global financial crisis, banks were permitted 
on temporary basis to avail of liquidity support under the LAF window through 
relaxation in maintenance of SLR to the extent of up to 1.5 per cent of their 
NDTL, exclusively for meeting the funding requirements of NBFCs and mutual 
funds.   
ï The combined balance sheets of Financial Institutions (FIs) during 2008-09 
expanded sharply by 20.8 per cent over the previous year. On the liabilities side, 
the resources raised by way of bonds and debentures declined by 9.3 per cent  6
during 2008-09. However, deposits and borrowings registered sharp increases of 
80.7 per cent and 20.0 per cent, respectively. Among the assets of FIs, loans 
and advances continued to expand by 21.5 per cent and investment portfolio 
also recorded an increase of 21.8 per cent (para 6.17 , page 194).  
ï The operating profit of the FIs increased by 33.5 per cent during the year. The 
net profit of FIs also increased despite higher provisions for taxation (para 6.23, 
page 197). 
ï The capital adequacy ratio of all the FIs continued to be significantly higher than 
the minimum stipulated norm of 9 per cent (para 6.27, page 198).  
ï Total number of NBFCs registered with the Reserve Bank, consisting of NBFCs-
D (deposit-taking NBFCs), RNBCs, mutual benefit companies (MBCs), 
miscellaneous non-banking companies (MNBCs) and Nidhi companies, declined 
from 12,809 at end-June 2008 to 12,740 at end-June 2009 (para 6.45, page 
202). 
ï Total assets/liabilities of NBFCs (excluding RNBCs) expanded at the rate of 1.3 
per cent during 2008-09 as compared with 53.6 per cent during 2007-08 (para 
6.48, page 203). 
ï Continuing the trend of the previous year, public deposits held by all groups of 
NBFCs taken together, declined moderately by 4.9 per cent during 2008-09. This 
trend was indicative of the shift in preference of NBFCs from public deposits to 
bank loans/ debentures (para 6.50, page 204).  
ï Following the trend of the previous year, deposits held by NBFCs across all the 
regions declined during 2008-09 except western region (para 6.52, page 205). 
Financial Stability 
ï A number of countries have initiated financial stability analysis in their financial 
stability reports (FSRs) to assess the forward-looking risks and outlook for 
financial stability (paras 7.10 -7.13, pages 227-228).  
ï The chapter provides a summary of the initiatives taken by various countries with 
regard to financial stability analysis.  The FSRs focus on a number of key 
indicators, of the real economy, corporate sector, household sector, financial 
sector, financial markets and external sector, either individually or in 
combination. The use of such measures, including the financial soundness 
indicators, depends on the benchmarks and thresholds which would characterise 
their behaviour in normal times and during periods of stress. In the absence of 
benchmarks, the analysis of these measures would depend on identifying 
changes in trend, major disturbances and other outliers. FSRs are published by 
both types of central banks, those which focus on single objective, such as price 
stability, and those which focus on multiple objectives, such as economic 
progress, price stability, and sound and strong external sector (para 7.23; page 
231; Box VII.2 and Annex VII.1, pages 231 and 274). 
ï Financial stability in India has been achieved through implementation of an 
appropriate mix of monetary and prudential measures, like measures with regard 
to investment portfolio of banks, capital adequacy norms, provisions against 
standard assets, among others. Such measures prevent institutions from 
excessive risk taking, and financial markets from becoming extremely volatile 
and turbulent. As a result, while there are orderly conditions in financial markets,  7
the financial institutions, especially banks, reflect strength and resilience (paras 
109-121; pages 262-267).  
ï Looking forward, however, there are significant challenges in attaining the 
objectives of financial stability as India gets further globalised. Like all other 
policy measures, maintaining financial stability involves trade-offs (like those 
between growth and financial stability) and throws up a number of challenges. 
For example, in the reform of regulatory architecture, issues like whether a 
central bank should also be the banking regulator need to be addressed. The 
tension between fiscal and monetary policies could potentially militate against 
financial stability (paras 7.122-132 ; pages 267-269). 
Summing up  
The Reportís main message is that the Indian banking system has exhibited 
resilience against the backdrop of global financial turmoil and slowdown of the Indian 
economy. Some of the reasons for Indiaís relative insulation from the global financial 
crisis are: (i) the nascent stage of development of credit derivative market, (ii) 
regulatory guidelines on securitization, which do not permit immediate profit recognition, 
(iii) perseverance of prudential policy, which prevent institutions from excessive risk 
taking and financial markets from becoming extremely volatile and turbulent and (iv) 
close coordination between supervision of banks and their regulation.  The nuanced 
approach to financial sector reforms, along with a gradual, well sequenced, and 
coordinated approach to their implementation s, has served India well. What have been 
ensured are: appropriate safeguards to ensure stability, while taking account of the 
prevailing governance standards, risk management systems and incentive frameworks 
in financial institutions in the economy.
