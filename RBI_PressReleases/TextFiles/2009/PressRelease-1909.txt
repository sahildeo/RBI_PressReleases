Returns to be filed by Banks : RBI Clarification 
 
The Reserve Bank of India has today clarified that scheduled commercial banks have to 
file the returns 'Statements showing interest rates of commercial banks for credit limits over Rs. 
2 lakh' and 'IBS-reporting of derivatives transactions'. Consequently, the number of returns 
banks have to submit to the Reserve Bank of India will be 225. 
 
It may be recalled that the Reserve Bank of India had, in its press release dated August 
14, 2008 announced that it would be introducing eXtensible Business Reporting Language 
(XBRL) based filing of returns. As part of XBRL implementation, the Reserve Bank had also 
rationalised the number of returns banks needed to submit to the Reserve Bank reducing them 
from 291 to 223. It had prepared and published two lists of returns – one list of returns to be 
submitted to the Reserve Bank and the other list of returns not to be submitted to the Reserve 
Bank.  It had also asked banks not to submit those returns which were enumerated in the list of 
returns not to be submitted.
