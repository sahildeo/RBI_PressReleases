RBI Releases Two Studies - “Introducing Expenditure Quality in 
Intergovernmental Transfers: A triple-E Framework” and "An Outline of Post 
2009 FRBM Fiscal Architecture of the Union Government in the Medium Term" 
 
The Reserve Bank of India released today two studies - “Introducing 
Expenditure Quality in Intergovernmental Transfers: A triple-E Framework” and "An 
Outline of Post 2009 FRBM Fiscal Architecture of the Union Government in the 
Medium Term" relating to the terms of reference of the Thirteenth Finance 
Commission.  
 
The first study entitled “Introducing Expenditure Quality in Intergovernmental 
Transfers: A triple-E Framework” is co-authored by Prof. Mala Lalvani, Department 
of Economics, University of Mumbai, along with research staff members from the 
Reserve Bank (Smt. Kumudini S. Hajra, Director, DEAP and Shri Brijesh 
Pazhayathodi, Research Officer, DEAP).  
 
The Thirteenth Finance Commission has for the first time been mandated to 
consider the need to improve the quality of public expenditure to obtain better 
outputs and outcomes in its devolution scheme. The Study has sought to introduce, 
conceptualise and operationalise a scheme for integrating the ‘quality’ dimension of 
public spending into the devolution scheme of intergovernmental transfers by the 
Finance Commission. The Study illustrates a scheme of inter-se distribution from an 
incentive fund, which is labeled as a “Quality Control Fund” (QCF). This fund could 
be kept aside to reward States for their performance on three aspects of expenditure 
quality, viz., Expenditure Adequacy; Effectiveness; and Efficiency. The Study has 
provided devolution formulas of the QCF based on a quantitative framework covering 
the three expenditure parameters. Devolution from the QCF would be in the nature 
of a reward or a bonus to the States for their performance on the various aspects of 
expenditure quality. The Study urges to tie the funds that the States receive from this 
incentive fund to spending on education and health. Further, a beginning towards 
result approach may be made by mandating output targets for the funds received 
from the QCF.  
 
The second study entitled "An Outline of Post 2009 FRBM Fiscal Architecture 
of the Union Government in the Medium Term" is co-authored by Ravindra H. 
Dholakia, IIM, Ahmedabad, along with research staff members from the Reserve 
Bank (Shri Jeevan K. Khundrakpam, Director, DEAP and Shri Dhirendra Gajbhiye, 
Research Officer, DEAP).   2
 
The study emphasises the need for reconciling the discrepancies between the 
fiscal deficit and movement in debt in designing a meaningful framework on fiscal 
consolidation in India. The paper finds that discrepancy between the two arose 
mainly due to: (i) exclusion of off-budget liabilities and Market Stabilization Scheme 
(MSS) in fiscal deficit while being part of outstanding liabilities; (ii) part of National 
Small Savings Fund (NSSF) being utilised by the States to finance their deficits 
being shown as liabilities of the Central Government; and (iii) financing of fiscal 
deficit by draw-down or build-up in cash balances. Accordingly, the paper attempts to 
reconcile the discrepancy and also reclassifies the expenditure components into 
current and investment component as against revenue and capital components in 
the Budget.  
 
  For the fiscal consolidation framework, interest payments (IP) to revenue 
receipts (RR) ratio is considered the target variable, and based on budgetary 
identity, the Study derives the tolerable level of deficit and debt under alternative 
assumptions of growth and interest rate. From the derived tolerable level of deficit, 
the components of expenditure are calibrated by making adjustments in the 
discretionary component. Under alternative assumptions of growth, interest rate, 
revenue buoyancy and chosen ratio of targeted interest payments to revenue 
receipts (IP-RR), the paper generates a menu of choices on the path of fiscal 
consolidation during the medium term. The Study provides simulated results of 54 
alternative fiscal scenarios based on interest rate, revenue buoyancy and target ratio 
of IP-RR which may help in building a framework for post 2009 FRBM fiscal 
architecture.  
 
Both the studies were undertaken under the aegis of the Development 
Research Group of the Reserve Bank. The Studies are available on the Reserve 
Bank's website (www.rbi.org.in) under Publications.  
 
(Note: Development Research Group (DRG) is constituted in the Reserve Bank's 
Department of Economic Analysis and Policy for undertaking effective policy-
oriented research backed by strong analytical and empirical basis on subjects of 
current interests. The views expressed in these studies are those of the authors and
