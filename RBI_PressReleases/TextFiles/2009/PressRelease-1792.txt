RBI amends Banking Ombudsman Scheme: includes complaints relating to 
Internet Banking and Non-adherence to BCSBI Code
The Reserve Bank of India has widened the scope of its Banking Ombudsman 
Scheme 2006, to include deficiencies arising out of internet banking. Under the 
amended Scheme, a customer would also be able to lodge a complaint against the 
bank for its non-adherence to the provisions of the fair practices code for lenders or the 
Code of Bank's Commitment to Customers issued by the Banking Codes and 
Standards Board of India (BCSBI). The BCSBI is an independent and autonomous 
watchdog set up by the Reserve Bank to monitor and ensure that the codes and 
standards adopted by the banks for rendering banking services are adhered to in true 
spirit.  
As per the amended Scheme, the Banking Ombudsman can award 
compensation not exceeding Rupees one lakh to the complainant in the case of 
complaints arising out of credit card operations, taking into account the loss of the 
complainant's time, expenses incurred by him as also, harassment and mental anguish 
suffered. Further, non-observance of the Reserve Bank's guidelines on engagement of 
recovery agents by banks has also been brought specifically under the purview of the 
Scheme. 
Any customer who has a grievance against a bank can complain to the Banking 
Ombudsman in whose jurisdiction the branch of the bank complained against is 
located. Some banks have centralised certain transactions, like housing loans, credit 
cards, etc. If there are complaints regarding such transactions, complaints would have 
to be made to the Banking Ombudsman in the State in which the bank customer 
receives the bill.
In addition, the Reserve Bank has simplified the format for lodging complaint to 
the Banking Ombudsman. Though the complainant need not lodge his complaint in a 
specific format, the Scheme now provides for an easy-to-fill format for lodging 
complaints, in case complainants prefer to use it. The jurisdictions of the Banking 
Ombudsman at Kanpur, New Delhi, Chandigarh, Chennai and Thiruvananthapuram 
have been rationalised to include/exclude certain areas taking into account the 
geographical proximity of those areas to the Office of the Banking Ombudsman.  
The amended Scheme however, does not include certain banking transactions, 
such as, failure to honour bank guarantee or letter of credit, etc. Complaints on these 
areas of banking services are insignificant in number.  
For wider dissemination, the Reserve Bank has asked all banks to place a copy 
of the Banking Ombudsman Scheme on their website. The amended Scheme is also 
available on the Reserve Bank's website at www.bankingombudsman.rbi.org.in
