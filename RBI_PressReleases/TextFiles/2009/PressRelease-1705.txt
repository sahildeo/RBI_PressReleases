RBIís Appeal to Public 
 
The United Forum of Reserve Bank Officersí and Employees has given a call to 
its members to apply for mass casual leave on Friday, February 20, 2009. The Reserve 
Bank of India has stated that such action on their part amounts to cessation of work and 
concerted refusal to work.  
 
The Reserve Bank has also stated that this agitational programme is likely to 
cause some disruption of normal work of the Reserve Bank on that day, including the 
payment and settlement system.  While it will endeavor to maintain normal services, the 
Reserve Bank has advised the members of public to complete their transactions, if any, 
with the Reserve Bank on February 19, 2009 itself.
