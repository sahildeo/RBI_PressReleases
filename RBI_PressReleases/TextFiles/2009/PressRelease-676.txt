RBI Releases Study on "Strengthening Decentralisation - Augmenting the Consolidated 
fund of the States by the Thirteenth Finance Commission: A Normative Approach" 
A Reserve Bank of India study, released today - "Strengthening Decentralisation - 
Augmenting the Consolidated fund of the States by the Thirteenth Finance Commission: A 
Normative Approach" relates to the terms of reference of the Thirteenth Finance 
Commission.  
The authors of the Study Shri Abhay Pethe, University of Mumbai along with 
research staff members from the Reserve Bank (Shri B.M. Misra, Adviser, DEAP and Kum. 
Rakhe P.B., Research Officer, DEAP) opine that there is a need to fine tune the micro 
design of local body grants in view of the recent developments in the Central and State 
finances.  The Study also emphasises that the criteria for the devolution of local body 
grants across the States need a revisit. The study was undertaken under the aegis of the 
Development Research Group of the Reserve Bank. In a nutshell, the Study makes the 
following suggestions:  
ï Provide Rs.94,451 crore as the local body grant.  
ï Set up an incentive fund of Rs.6,000 crore for assisting the local bodies to access 
capital market.  
ï Include a measure of decentralisation in the devolution formula for the share in 
central taxes.  
ï Keep the grants to local bodies unconditional.  
ï Ensure that the release of local body grants is evenly distributed over the fiscal year.  
ï Ensure that the State Governments are transferring the local body grants promptly 
and efficiently to the local Government level.  
ï Provide a uniform template to the SFCs.  
ï Incentivise the State Governments to set up a data warehouse for the local bodies.  
ï Set up a central pool of fiscal experts from which the State Governments may select 
at least one member of SFC. 
ï Provide a time line to the State Governments in link to the release of share in central 
taxes for making progress in the arena of SFC.  
ï Estimate the grants to local bodies on a normative basis.  
ï Till such time as the decentralisation truly takes roof and SFCs are well established 
and recognised, talk directly to the local bodies (at the district level) and think of 
transferring resources directly to them.
