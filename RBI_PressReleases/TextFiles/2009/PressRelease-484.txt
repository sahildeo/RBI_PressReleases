Reserve Bank Cancels the Licence of 
The Nagpur Mahila Nagari Sahakari Bank Ltd,  Nagpur (Maharashtra) 
In view of the fact that The Nagpur Mahila Nagari Sahakari Bank Ltd, Nagpur, 
(Maharashtra) had ceased to be solvent, all efforts to revive it in close consultation with the 
Government of Maharashtra had failed and the depositors of the bank were being 
inconvenienced by continued uncertainty, the Reserve Bank of India delivered the order, 
canceling its licence to the bank after the close of business on September 8, 2009. The 
Registrar of Co-operative Societies, Maharashtra has also been requested to issue an order 
for winding up of the bank and appoint a Liquidator for the bank. It may be highlighted that 
on liquidation every depositor is entitled to repayment of his deposits up to a monetary 
ceiling of Rs.1,00,000/- (Rupees One Lakh only) from the Deposit Insurance and Credit 
Guarantee Corporation (DICGC).    
The bank was granted a licence by Reserve Bank on October 11, 1976 to commence 
banking business. The findings of the statutory inspection conducted with reference to its 
financial position as on March 31, 2003 revealed that the financial position of the bank was 
unsatisfactory. The bank was placed under directions under Section 35A of the Banking 
Regulation Act, 1949 (As Applicable to Cooperative Societies) vide order dated September 
20, 2004 precluding it from incurring any liability. 
The bankís financial performance was being reviewed constantly.  However, as the 
financial position of the bank did not show much improvement, the Reserve Bank issued a 
notice to the bank on March 5, 2009 asking it to show cause as to why the licence granted to 
it under Section 22 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949(As Applicable to Cooperative 
Societies) on October 11, 1976 to conduct banking business should not be cancelled. The 
bank's reply to the show cause notice was examined and was found unacceptable. 
The statutory inspection of the bank conducted by RBI with reference to its financial 
position as on March 31, 2009 revealed that the bank was not complying with several 
provisions of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (As applicable to Cooperative Societies) and 
had also violated several RBI guidelines / instructions.  
The realizable value of bank's paid-up capital and reserves was negative and the 
chances of its revival were remote.  In the absence of a viable action plan, the Reserve Bank 
of India took the extreme measure of canceling licence of the bank in the interest of the 
bank's depositors. With the cancellation of its licence and commencement of liquidation 
proceedings, the process of paying the depositors of The Nagpur Mahila Nagari Sahakari 
Bank Ltd, Nagpur, (Maharashtra), the amount insured as per the DICGC Act will be set in 
motion, subject to the terms and condition of Deposit Insurance Corporation. 
Consequent to the cancellation of its licence, The Nagpur Mahila Sahakari Bank Ltd , 
Nagpur, (Maharashtra) is prohibited from carrying on 'banking business' as defined in 
Section 5(b) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (As Applicable to Cooperative Societies) 
including acceptance and repayment of deposits.   
For any clarifications, depositors may approach Smt. M. Yashoda Bai, Deputy 
General Manager, Urban Banks Department, Reserve Bank of India, Nagpur. Her contact 
details are as below:
