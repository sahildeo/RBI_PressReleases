RBI Announces Auction-based OMO purchases of 
Government Securities 
 
Until recently, as part of its Open Market Operations (OMO), the Reserve Bank of 
India has ordinarily been buying Government securities through NDS-OM.  For more 
effective liquidity management, it has now been decided to widen the scope of such OMO 
by including purchases of Government securities through an auction-based mechanism in 
addition to operations through NDS-OM, as hitherto. 
  
Accordingly, the first such auction will be held on February 19, 2009, with settlement 
on February 20, 2009.   
 
The other details of the auction including the size, timing, securities, etc. would be 
announced separately.
