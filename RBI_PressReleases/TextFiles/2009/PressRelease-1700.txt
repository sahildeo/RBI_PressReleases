Framework for addressing the liquidity constraints of NBFCs 
The Government of India has announced an arrangement for providing liquidity 
support to meet the temporary liquidity mismatches for eligible Non-Banking Financial 
Companies-Non-Deposit Taking-Systemically Important (NBFC-ND-SI) through a 
Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV). The scheme has been finalised and Industrial 
Development Bank of India Stressed Asset Stabilisation Fund (IDBI SASF) Trust has 
been notified as Special Purpose Vehicle for undertaking this operation.   
The Reserve Bank of India will purchase securities issued by the SPV 
guaranteed by the Government of India for aggregated amount of Rs.20,000 crore.  The 
SPV will purchase the short term paper from the issuing NBFCs directly.  The short term 
instruments will be Commercial Papers and Non-convertible Debentures, with residual 
maturity not more than 90 days and rated as investment grade.  The facility would not 
be available for any paper issued after March 31, 2009.  Eligible NBFCs-ND-SI may 
approach the SPV- IDBI SASF Trust for considering their request for purchase of short 
term paper.
