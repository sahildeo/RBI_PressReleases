RBI TAG suggests Quarterly Compilation of Housing Start-up Index 
Housing Start-up Index (HSUI) based on newly built residential units in urban 
India may be compiled on a quarterly basis and the Reserve Bank of India may set up a 
Standing Committee to launch this initiative, monitor its progress, commission and 
overview the surveys for constructing start-up coefficients and consider increasing the 
scope and coverage of HSUI over time. These were among the major 
recommendations of the Technical Advisory Group (TAG) on Housing Start-up Index. 
The TAG has also suggested that the National Buildings Organisation (NBO), Ministry 
of Housing & Urban Poverty Alleviation, Government of India may collect the data on 
building permits issued for the new residential buildings in various centres across the 
country. Further, according to the TAG, an Advisory Committee on HSUI at NBO may 
be set up to guide and oversee the entire process of compilation of housing permit data 
from concerned local bodies and the Directorate of Economics and Statistics of the 
state governments.  
The number of housing starts during a period indicates the demand and supply 
situation in the housing market, as reflected in conversion of the building permits into 
actual starts. Housing starts are considered as a lead indicator of economic activities 
because of their strong forward and backward linkages with other sectors.  
A TAG was constituted by the Reserve Bank of India to suggest a 
methodological framework and institutional arrangements for regular compilation of 
Housing Start-up Index under the chairmanship of Prof. Amitabh Kundu, Member, 
National Statistical Commission (NSC). Prof. Amitabh Kundu, submitted the Report of 
the TAG to Dr. Rakesh Mohan, Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India in the 
presence of Ms. Kiran Dhingra, Secretary, Ministry of Housing and Urban Poverty 
Alleviation on March 3, 2009. The Report has been placed on the RBI website for wider 
dissemination and comments.
