Proposed Terms of Reference of the Working Group on BPLR - 
Comments by June 19, 2009. 
The concept of Benchmark Prime Lending Rate (BPLR) was introduced in 
November 2003 for pricing of loans by commercial banks with the objective of 
enhancing transparency in the pricing of their loan products. 
  The Annual Policy Statement 2009-10 (Para 87) released in April 2009 noted 
that, over time, the system of BPLR has evolved in such a manner that it has lost its 
relevance as a meaningful reference rate as bulk of loans are advanced below 
BPLR. Furthermore, this impedes the smooth transmission of monetary signals and 
makes the loan pricing system non-transparent. Accordingly, in order to review the 
present BPLR system and suggest changes to make credit pricing more transparent, 
the policy proposed constitution of a Working Group on Benchmark Prime Lending 
Rate. 
 Accordingly, the Working Group is now constituted. It will be chaired by      
Shri Deepak Mohanty, Executive Director, Reserve Bank of India and will have 
representations from the concerned departments of the Reserve Bank, Indian Banksí 
Association, Banking Codes and Standards Board of India, and public, private and 
foreign banks.  The Group would also comprise external experts. 
 The proposed Terms of Reference of the Working Group are as follows: 
a) to review the concept of BPLR and the manner of its computation; 
b) to examine the extent of sub-BPLR lending ;  
c) to examine the wide divergence in BPLRs  of major banks; 
d) to suggest an appropriate loan pricing system based on international 
best practices; 
e) to review the administered lending rates for small loans up to Rs 2 lakh 
and for exporters.   
f) to suggest suitable benchmark for floating rate loans in the retail 
segment; and 
g) consider any other issue relating to lending rates. 
 Comments and suggestions on the terms of reference may please be 
addressed to the Adviser-in-Charge, Monetary Policy Department, Reserve Bank of 
India, Central Office, Mumbai 400 001 or may be sent by email to him by June 19, 
2009.
