Draft Circular on Liquidity Risk Management now by October 2009 : RBI 
The Reserve Bank of India has stated that it will now place on its website the 
draft circular on liquidity risk management, as also, the guidance note on ‘Liquidity 
Risk Management’ latest by October 31, 2009. The decision has been taken in view 
of the evolving nature of liquidity risk management globally and further work being 
carried out by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) on this issue.   
It was indicated in paragraph 143 of Annual Policy Statement 2009-10 that a 
draft circular detailing the modalities for adopting the integrated liquidity risk 
management system as also the guidance note on ‘Liquidity Risk Management’ 
would be placed on the Reserve Bank’s website by June 15, 2009. The circular and 
the guidance note were to be based on Basel Committee’s ‘Principles for Sound 
Liquidity Risk Management and Supervision’ brought out in September 2008 as well 
as other international best practices.
