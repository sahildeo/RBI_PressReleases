Indiaís External Debt as at the end of March 2009 
As per the standard practice, India's external debt statistics for the quarters 
ending March and June are released by the Reserve Bank of India and those for the 
quarters ending September and December by the Ministry of Finance, Government 
of India. The external debt data are released with a lag of one quarter. A detailed 
account of external debt as compiled in the standard format as at end-March 2009 in 
rupee and US dollar terms and revised data for the earlier quarters are set out in 
Statement 1 and 2, respectively. The developments relating to Indiaís external debt 
as at end-March 2009 are discussed in the following paragraphs. 
Major Highlights of External Debt 
(i) Indiaís external debt, as at end-March 2009, was placed at US $ 229.9 billion 
(22.0 per cent of GDP) recording an increase of US $ 5.3 billion or 2.4 per 
cent over the level of the previous year mainly due to the increase in trade 
credits.  
(ii) As per an international comparison of external debt of the twenty most 
indebted countries, India was the fifth most indebted country in 2007.  
(iii) By way of composition of external debt, the share of commercial borrowings 
was the highest at 27.3 per cent as at end-March 2009 followed by short-term 
debt (21.5 per cent), NRI deposits (18.1 per cent) and multilateral debt (17.2 
per cent). 
(iv) The debt service ratio has declined steadily over the years, and stood at 4.6 
per cent as at end-March 2009.  
(v) Excluding the valuation effects due to appreciation of US dollar against other 
major currencies and Indian rupee, the stock of external debt would have 
increased by US$ 18.7 billion as compared with the stock as at end-March 
2008. 
(vi) The share of short-term debt in total debt increased to 21.5 per cent at end-
March 2009 from 20.9 per cent at end-March 2008, primarily on account of 
rise in short-term trade credits.  
(vii) Based on residual maturity, the short-term debt accounted for 40.6 per cent of 
the total external debt at end-March 2009 
(viii) The ratio of short-term debt to foreign exchange reserves at 19.6 per cent in 
March 2009 was higher compared to 15.2 per cent in March 2008. 
(ix) The US dollar continues to remain the dominant currency accounting for 57.1 
per cent of the total external debt stock as at end-march 2009. 
(x) Indiaís foreign exchange reserves provided a cover of 109.6 per cent to the 
external debt stock at the end of March 2009 as compared with 137.9 per cent 
as at end-March 2008.   2
1. Stock of Indiaís External Debt as at end-March 2009

2. Valuation Changes 
(i) The valuation effect reflecting the appreciation of the US dollar against other 
major international currencies and Indian rupee resulted in a decline in Indiaís 
external debt by US $ 13.4 billion. This implies that excluding the valuation 
effects, the stock of external debt as at end-March 2009 would have increased 
by US $ 18.7 billion over the level at end-March 2008.

(iii) The rise in external debt stock was mainly due to the increase in trade credits 
which rose by US$ 4.2 billion over its level at end-March 2008.  
(iv) The short-term debt increased by US$ 2.4 billion as at end-March 2009 mainly 
on account of rise in short-term trade credits (Table 3 and Chart 2).   
(v) Outstanding NRI deposits at US $ 41.6 billion as at end-March 2009 declined 
by US $ 2.1 billion over the level at end-March 2008 mainly due to valuation 
effects as there was positive inflows under NRI deposits during 2008-09.

terms of major foreign currencies such as US dollar, Japanese Yen, Euro, 
Pound Sterling, Special Drawing Rights (SDR) and the domestic currency i.e., 
Indian Rupee.  
(ii) The US dollar continues to be the dominant currency accounting for 57.1 per 
cent of the total external debt stock as at end-March 2009, followed by the 
Japanese yen (14.2  per cent), Indian rupee (13.2 per cent) and SDR (9.2 per 
cent) (Table 5 and Chart 3). The share of Euro has been at around 4 per cent in 
the recent years.

6. Short-term Debt  
(i) The short-term debt has become an important component for measuring the 
liquidity and refinancing risks. In the recent years, efforts have been taken to 
expand the coverage of short-term external debt. The data on short-term debt 
now includes suppliersí credit up to and above 180 days, FII investments in 
Government debt, investment by foreign central banks and international 
institutions in Treasury Bills and external liabilities of central banks and 
commercial banks.  
(ii) Short-term debt by original maturity has increased over the period mainly 
because of the increase in trade related credits due to growing imports. The 
share of trade related credits in total short-term debt increased from 91.8 per 
cent as at end-March 2008 to 93.1 per cent as at end-March 2009 (Table 7).

7. External Debt by Residual Maturity 
(i) While external debt is generally compiled in terms of original maturity, analysing 
the external debt, in particular short term debt in terms of residual maturity is 
important from the point of view of foreign exchange liquidity management and 
to ascertain the total foreign exchange outgo on account of debt service 
payments in the immediate future.  
(ii) The ëshort-term debt by residual maturityí comprises the repayments due under 
medium and long-term debt by original maturity during one year reference 
period along with the short-term debt with original maturity. The balance 
constitutes the long-term debt by residual maturity. Based on residual maturity, 
the short-term debt accounted for 40.6 per cent of total external debt as at end- 9
March 2009. The ratio of short-term debt by residual maturity to foreign 
exchange reserves worked out to 37.0 per cent at end-March 2009 (Table 8).

9. Debt Service Payments 
(i) Indiaís debt service payments amounted to US $ 15.4 billion during 2008-09 
(April-March) as compared to US $14.9 billion during 2007-08 (April-March) 
(Table 10).

(ii) Indiaís debt service ratio has improved progressively over the years owing to 
the combined effect of moderation in debt service payments and growth in

external current receipts. The debt service ratio had declined from a peak of 
35.3 per cent in 1990-91 to 5.9 per cent in 2004-05 but increased to 10.1 per 
cent during 2005-06 due to repayments relating to the India Millennium 
Deposits. The debt service ratio declined to 4.6 per cent during 2008-09.   
(iii)   Servicing of External Commercial Borrowings (including principal and interest 
payments) accounted for 67.4 per cent of the total debt service during 2008-09.

(iv) At end-March 2009, the projected debt service payments for External 
Commercial Borrowings (ECBs) and Foreign Currency Convertible Bonds 
(FCCBs) revealed that the principal repayments between 2011-12 and 2012-13 
would be higher (Table 11). Despite consolidation of high cost loans and lower 
interest rates on the current borrowings, interest payments would also increase 
during these years due to higher disbursement. The projections do not include 
future debt service obligations arising out of fresh borrowings.

10. Sustainability of Indiaís External Debt 
(i) An assessment of sustainability of external debt is generally undertaken based 
on the trends in certain key ratios such as debt to GDP ratio, debt service ratio, 
short-term debt to total debt and total debt to foreign exchange reserves. India 
has managed its external debt successfully as reflected in the perceptible 
improvement in various external debt sustainability indicators (Table 12).  
(ii)  The ratio of external debt to GDP increased to 22.0 per cent as at end-March 
2009 from 19.0 per cent as at end-March 2008.  
(iii)  The debt service ratio has declined steadily over the years, and stood at 4.6 
percent as at end-March 2009.  
(iv) Indiaís foreign exchange reserves provided a cover of 109.6 per cent to the 
external debt stock at the end of March 2009 as compared to 137.9 per cent as 
at end-March 2008 (Chart 5).  
(v) The share of concessional debt in total external debt declined to 18.2 per cent 
as at end-March 2009 from 19.7 per cent at end-March 2008 reflecting the 
continuing increase in non-concessional private debt in India's external debt 
stock. 
(vi) The ratio of short-term debt to foreign exchange reserves at 19.6 per cent as at 
end-March 2009 was higher than that of 15.2 per cent in the previous year. 
(vii) The share of short-term debt in total debt increased to 21.5 per cent at end-
March 2009 from 20.9 per cent at end-March 2008.
