RBI-SEBI Committee on Interest Rate Futures 
 
 The Reserve Bank of India has today placed on its website the Report of the 
RBI-SEBI Standing Technical Committee on Interest Rate Futures. It may be 
recalled that RBI's Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) on Money, Foreign 
Exchange and Government Securities Markets had set up a Working Group on 
Interest Rate Futures (Chairman: Shri V.K.Sharma, Executive Director). The Final 
Report of the TAC was posted on RBI's website on August 8, 2008. 
  
As announced in the Mid-Term Review of Annual Policy for the year 2008-09 
(para 136), RBI-SEBI Standing Technical Committee had been entrusted with the 
work relating to the operationalisation of the recommendations of the TAC Report. 
The Committee has since submitted its report. The report is also available on the 
website of Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).
