India's Balance of Payments Developments during the Third Quarter 
(October-December 2008) of 2008-09 and April-December 2008 
Preliminary data on Indiaís balance of payments (BoP) for the third quarter (Q3) 
i.e., October-December 2008 of the financial year 2008-09, are now available. These 
preliminary data and the partially revised data for the first two quarters i.e., April-June 
2008(Q1) and July-September 2008 (Q2), have been taken into account for compiling 
the BoP data for the period April-December 2008 of the current financial year 2008-09. 
Full details of these data are set out in the standard format of BoP presentation in 
Statements I and II.  
Major Highlights of BoP for October-December (Q3) of 2008-09  
(i) Export growth turned negative during Q3 of 2008-09 for the first time after 2001-
02 due to global economic slowdown. 
(ii) Import growth on BoP basis decelerated to a single digit during Q3 of 2008-09 
after a gap of almost 6 years mainly led by lower crude oil prices and non-oil 
imports. 
(iii) Private transfer receipts declined only marginally during the quarter despite 
slowdown in economic activities in Gulf countries and in the advanced economies 
like the US and European countries. 
(iv) Even with the deepening of the global economic crisis, software exports recorded 
a growth of around 12 per cent during Q3 of 2008-09.  
(v) The current account deficit at US$ 14.6 billion during Q3 of 2008-09 was the 
highest quarterly deficit since 1990. 
(vi) For the first time since Q1 of 1998-99, the capital account balance turned negative 
during Q3 of 2008-09 mainly due to net outflows under portfolio investment, 
banking capital and short-term trade credit.  
(vii) There was, however, a turnaround in the net inflows under the non-resident Indian 
(NRI) deposits in Q3 of 2008-09 responding to the hike in ceiling interest rates on 
NRI deposits. 
(viii) The foreign exchange reserves on BoP basis (i.e., excluding valuation) declined 
due to widening of current account deficit combined with net outflows under the 
capital account. The largest decline in reserves during any one quarter in earlier 
years at US$ 4.7 billion was last observed in Q3 of 2005-06.

Merchandise Trade 
(i) On a BoP basis, Indiaís merchandise exports recorded a decline of 10.4 per cent 
in Q3 of 2008-09 as against an increase of 33.0 per cent in Q3 of 2007-08. 
(ii) As per the commodity-wise data released by the Directorate General of 
Commercial Intelligence and Statistics (DGCI&S) for the period October-
November 2008, merchandise exports declined by 16.3 per cent, reflecting a fall 
in exports of all commodity groups except engineering goods. Amongst the 
commodities, exports of rice, raw cotton, sugar and molasses, iron ore, iron and 
steel, gems and jewellery showed maximum fall in export growth during this 
period.  
(iii) Import payments, on a BoP basis, registered a lower growth of 8.9 per cent in Q3 
of 2008-09 as compared to a high growth of 41.9 per cent in Q3 of 2007-08. 
According to the data released by the DGCI&S, the slowdown in import growth is 
mainly attributed to decline in oil import payments due to sharp fall in oil prices 
during October-December 2008. 
(iv) The commodity-wise break up of imports data released by the DGCI&S revealed 
negative growth in imports of certain commodities like capital goods, non-ferrous 
metals, artificial resins and plastic materials, textile yarn and medicinal and 
pharmaceutical products along with a decline in oil imports leading to a lower 
import growth of 2.3 per cent during October-November 2008 as compared with 
29.3 per cent during the corresponding period of previous year.   
Trade Deficit 
(i) Consequent upon a negative export growth, the trade deficit on a BoP basis was 
higher at US$ 36.3 billion during Q3 of 2008-09 (US$ 26.1 billion in Q3 of 2007-
08). 
 
Invisibles  3
(i) Both invisibles receipts and payments recorded negative growth, though 
marginal, during Q3 of 2008-09 reflecting the impact of global economic 
slowdown. 
(ii) Invisibles receipts registered a marginal decline of 0.6 per cent in Q3 of 2008-09 
(as against an increase of 33.2 per cent in Q3 of 2007-08) on account of a decline 
in travel, transportation and insurance receipts in the services category and 
private transfers and investment income receipts. Overall services exports, 
however, witnessed a marginal increase of 0.5 per cent during the quarter 
(compared with a higher growth of 33.4 per cent in Q3 of 2007-08) due to increase 
in software exports.

(iii) Private transfer receipts declined marginally during Q3 of 2008-09. Software 
services receipts, on the other hand, increased by 11.8 per cent during the 
quarter.  
(iv) Invisibles payments also recorded a marginal negative growth of 2.1 per cent 
during Q3 of 2008-09 mainly led by sharp decline in payments under travel, 
software and business services account. There was also a marginal decline in 
payments under investment income in the form of interest payments and 
dividends. 
(v) With the decline in invisibles payments higher than the receipts, the net invisibles 
(invisibles receipts minus invisibles payments) rose moderately to US$ 21.7 billion 
in Q3 of 2008-09 (Table 2). At this level, net invisibles surplus financed 59.7 per 
cent of trade deficit in Q3 of 2008-09 (82.6 per cent in Q3 of 2007-08). 
 
Current Account Deficit  4
(i) On account of large trade deficit and with moderate increase in net 
invisibles, the current account deficit rose sharply to US$ 14.6 billion in Q3 of 
2008-09 (US$ 4.5 billion in Q3 of 2007-08). This level of CAD was the highest 
quarterly deficit since 1990. 
Capital Account and Reserves 
(i) Capital account balance turned negative showing outflows of US$ 3.7 billion 
during the Q3 of 2008-09 (net inflows at US$ 31.0 billion during Q3 of 2007-08) for 
the first time since Q1 of 1998-99 mainly due to net outflows under portfolio 
investment, banking capital and short-term trade credit (Table 3). 
(ii) The gross capital inflows to India during Q3 of 2008-09 amounted to US$ 70.0 
billion (US$ 127.3 billion in Q3 of 2007-08) as against gross outflows from India at 
US$ 73.6 billion (US$ 96.3 billion in Q3 of 2007-08). Other components of the 
capital account which recorded a fall during the quarter were inflows and outflows 
under foreign direct investment and external commercial borrowings, while inflows 
under short-term trade credit also declined during the quarter.   
(iii) Net FDI flows (net inward FDI minus net outward FDI) amounted to US$ 0.8 billion 
in Q3 of 2008-09 (US$ 2.0 billion in Q3 of 2007-08). Net inward FDI stood at US$ 
6.7 billion during Q3 of 2008-09 (US$ 7.9 billion in Q3 of 2007-08). Net outward 
FDI remained buoyant at US$ 5.9 billion in Q3 of 2008-09 (US$ 5.8 billion in Q3 of 
2007-08).

(iv) Portfolio investment primarily comprising foreign institutional investorsí (FIIs) 
investments and American Depository Receipts (ADRs)/Global Depository 
Receipts (GDRs) continued to witness net outflows at US$ 5.8 billion in Q3 of 
2008-09 (as against net inflows of US$ 14.9 billion in Q3 of 2007-08). Outflows 
under portfolio investment were led by large sales of equities by FIIs in the Indian  5
stock market and slowdown in net inflows under ADRs/GDRs due to 
drying-up of liquidity in the overseas market. Another feature observed in the 
context of portfolio flows was that not only net flows remained negative but both 
inflows as well as outflows reduced sharply during the quarter. 
(v) Net External Commercial Borrowings (ECBs) remained lower at US$ 3.9 billion in 
Q3 of 2008-09 (US$ 6.2 billion in Q3 of 2007-08) due to drying up of liquidity 
abroad and increased cost of borrowings.  
(vi) Short-term trade credit to India witnessed a net outflow of US$ 3.1 billion (as 
against inflows of US$ 4.1 billion in Q3 of 2007-08) mainly due to lower 
disbursements reflecting tightness in the overseas market and increased 
repayments as roll over was difficult.   
(vii) There was a turnaround in the inflows under the non-resident Indian (NRI) 
deposits to US$ 1.0 billion during Q3 of 2008-09 (outflow of US$ 0.9 billion during 
Q3 of 2007-08) responding to the hike in ceiling interest rates on NRI deposits. 
(viii) The foreign exchange reserves on BoP basis (i.e., excluding valuation) declined 
sharply by US$ 17.9 billion in Q3 of 2008-09 as against an accretion of reserves 
of US$ 26.7 billion in Q3 of 2007-08. The decline in the reserves was due to 
widening of current account deficit combined with outflows under the capital 
account. The largest decline in reserves on a BoP basis during any one quarter in 
earlier years at US$ 4.7 billion was observed in the Q3 of 2005-06. Even during 
the balance of payments crisis of the early 1990s, a decline of US$ 1.5 billion was 
seen in the third quarter (October-December 1990), while a decline of US$ 1.1 
billion was observed during April-June 1991. 
2. Balance of Payments (BoP) for April-December 2008 
 
(i) As mentioned earlier, taking into account the partially revised data for Q1 and Q2 
of 2008-09 and the preliminary data for Q3 of 2008-09, the BoP data for April-
December 2008 have been compiled. While the detailed data are set out in 
Statements I and II in the standard format of BoP presentation, the major items 
are presented in Table 4.

Merchandise Trade 
(i) On a BoP basis, Indiaís merchandise exports posted a growth of 17.5 per cent 
during April-December 2008 (21.9 per cent in the corresponding period of the 
previous year). 
(ii) According to the commodity-wise data available for April-November 2008 from the 
DGCI&S, the exports of engineering goods and petroleum products showed high  6
growth, while growth in textile products, ores and minerals, and 
gems and jewellery registered sharp slowdown. The exports of marine products, 
raw cotton, iron ore and handicrafts declined during the period.  
(iii) Import payments,  on a BoP basis, remained higher and recorded a growth of 30.6 
per cent during April-December 2008 as compared with 28.3 per cent in the 
corresponding period of the previous year. 
(iv) According to the DGCI&S data, while oil imports recorded a significant growth of 
43.3 per cent in April-December 2008 (24.0 per cent in the corresponding period 
of the previous year), growth in non-oil imports slowed down to 25.0 per cent  from 
29.3 per cent in the corresponding period of the previous year. In absolute terms, 
oil imports accounted for about 34.7 per cent of total imports during April-
December 2008 (31.7 per cent in the corresponding period of the previous year).  
(v) According to the DGCI&S data, out of the total increase in imports of US$ 52.8 
billion in April-December 2008 over the corresponding period of the previous year, 
oil imports contributed an increase of US$ 23.6 billion (44.6 per cent as against 
28.4 per cent in April-December 2007), while non-oil imports contributed an 
increase of US$ 29.2 billion (55.4 per cent as against 71.6 per cent in April-
December 2007).  
(vi) According to the commodity-wise DGCI&S data available for April-November 
2008, the items under non-oil imports which showed a high growth were fertilizers, 
paper and paper products, manufactures of metals, project goods, export related 
items like pearls, precious and semi-precious stones, chemicals,  and coal, coke 
and briquettes, while imports of items like pulses, electronic goods, and gold and 
silver declined. 
(vii) The sharp increase in oil imports reflected the impact of the increase in oil price of 
the Indian basket of international crude (a mix of Oman, Dubai and Brent 
varieties), which had increased to an average of US$ 132.5 per barrel in July 
2008, but came down subsequently to an average of US$ 40.6 per barrel in 
December 2008. The average oil prices were higher at US$ 95.5 per barrel in 
April-December 2008 as compared with an average of US$ 74.7 per barrel in the 
corresponding period of the previous year (Chart 1).

Trade Deficit 
(i) On a BoP basis, the merchandise trade deficit widened sharply to US$ 105.3 
billion during April-December 2008 from US$ 69.3 billion in April-December 2007 
on account of higher growth in imports coupled with the slowdown in exports 
(Chart 2).

Invisibles 
Invisibles Receipts 
(i) Invisibles receipts witnessed a lower growth of 18.8 per cent during April-
December 2008 (30.1 per cent in the corresponding period of the previous year) 
mainly due to slow pace of growth in travel, business services and investment 
income receipts (Table 5 and Chart 3).  
(ii) Travel receipts at US$ 8.2 billion during April-December 2008 rose moderately by 
6.2 per cent (26.2 per cent in April-December 2007) reflecting slowdown in tourist 
arrivals in the country.

(iii) Private transfers are mainly in the form of (i) Inward remittances from Indian 
workers abroad for family maintenance, (ii) Local withdrawal from NRI Rupee 
deposits, (iii) Gold and silver brought through passenger baggage, and (iv) 
Personal gifts/donations to charitable/religious institutions. 
(iv) Private transfer receipts, comprising mainly remittances from Indians working 
overseas, increased to US$ 36.9 billion in April-December 2008 from US$ 29.3 
billion in the corresponding period of the previous year. Private transfer receipts 
constituted 14.4 per cent of current receipts in April-December 2008 (13.5 per cent 
in the corresponding period of the previous year).

(v) NRI deposits when withdrawn domestically, form part of private transfers because 
once withdrawn for local use these become unilateral transfers and do not have 
any quid pro quo. Such local withdrawals/redemptions from NRI deposits cease to 
exist as liability in the capital account of the balance of payments and assume the 
form of private transfers, which is included in the current account of balance of 
payments. 
(vi) Under the NRI deposits, both inflows as well as outflows remained large in the 
recent past. A major part of outflows from NRI deposits is in the form of local 
withdrawals. These withdrawals, however, are not actually repatriated but are 
utilized domestically. During April-December 2008, the share of local withdrawals 
in total outflows from NRI deposits declined to 63.3 per cent from 64.6 per cent in 
April-December 2007, reflecting higher outflows under FCNR (B) accounts (Table 
6).

(vii) Under Private transfers, the inward remittances for family maintenance   accounted 
for about 50.4 per cent of the total private transfer receipts, while local withdrawals 
accounted for about 44.0 per cent in April-December 2008 as against 49.7 per cent 
and 43.3 per cent, respectively, in April-December 2007 (Table 7).

(viii) Software receipts at US$ 34.6 billion showed a steady growth of 26 per cent in 
April-December 2008. The NASSCOM has projected a growth rate of 16-17 per 
cent during 2008-09 with a target of software services export revenues at around 
US$ 47 billion for the financial year. 
(ix) Miscellaneous receipts, excluding software exports, stood at US$ 22.4 billion in

(x) The key components of the business services receipts and payments were 
mainly the trade related services, business and management consultancy 
services, architectural, engineering and other technical services, and services 
relating to maintenance of offices abroad. These reflect the underlying momentum 
in trade of professional and technology related services. While receipts under 
trade related and business and management consultancy services increased, the 
receipts under architectural, engineering, and other technical services declined 
during April-December 2008 (Table 9). 
(xi) Investment income receipts amounted to US$ 10.3 billion in April-December 2008 
as compared with US$ 9.3 billion in April-December 2007.

Invisibles Payments 
(i) Like invisibles receipts, invisibles payments also showed a lower growth of 8.7 per 
cent in April-December 2008 (13.2 per cent in April-December 2007) mainly on 
account of slowdown in payments relating to travel, software services and a 
number of business and professional services.  
(ii) Travel payments growth remained lower at 5.9 per cent during April-December 
2008 (31.1 per cent in April-December 2007) reflecting a sharp reduction in 
outbound travels. According to the International Transport Association, 
international passenger volumes increased marginally by 1.6 per cent in 2008 led 
by a 1.5 per cent decline for Asia-Pacific region.  
(iii) Investment income payments, reflecting mainly the interest payments on 
commercial borrowings, external assistance and non-resident deposits, and 
reinvested earnings of the foreign direct investment (FDI) enterprises operating in 
India declined marginally to US$ 13.3 billion in April-December 2008 (US$ 13.5 
billion in the corresponding period of the previous year) mainly due to decline in 
interest payments on NRI deposits and reinvested earnings of FDI companies in 
India (Table 10).

Invisibles Balance 
(i) Net invisibles (invisibles receipts minus invisibles payments) stood higher at US$ 
68.9 billion during April-December 2008 (US$ 53.8 billion during April-December 
2007) mainly led by receipts under private transfers and software services. At this 
level, the invisibles surplus financed about 65.4 per cent of trade deficit during 
April-December 2008 as against 77.6 per cent during April-December 2007. 
Current Account Deficit 
(i) Despite higher net invisibles surplus, the large trade deficit mainly on account of 
higher growth in imports coupled with slowdown in export growth in the third 
quarter led to higher current account deficit at US$ 36.5 billion in April-December 
2008 (US$ 15.5 billion during April-December 2007) (Chart 4).

Capital Account  
 
(i) The gross capital inflows to India during April-December 2008 decreased to US$ 
246.4 billion (US$ 291.8 billion in April-December 2007) as against an increase in 
outflows to US$ 231.1 billion (US$ 209.8 billion in April-December 2007)    (Table 
11).  
(ii) Net capital flows, however, at US$ 15.3 billion in April-December 2008 remained 
much lower as compared with US$ 82.0 billion in April-December 2007. Under net 
capital flows, all the major components except FDI and NRI deposits, showed 
decline during April-December 2008 from their level in the corresponding period of 
the previous year (Table 12). The decline was sharp in the case of portfolio flows 
and short-term trade credits to India. 
(iii) Net inward FDI into India remained buoyant at US$ 27.4 billion during April-
December 2008 (US$ 20.0 billion in April-December 2007) reflecting relatively 
better investment climate in India and the continuing liberalization measures to 
attract FDI. During April-December 2008, FDI was channeled mainly into 
manufacturing (21.4 per cent) followed by financial services (14.1 per cent) and 
communication services (12.0 per cent).  
(iv) Net outward FDI from India continued to remain high at US$ 12.0 billion during 
April-December 2008 even in the current economic situation. However, it was 
marginally lower than that of US$ 13.1 billion invested during April-December 
2007. Due to large inward FDI, the net FDI (inward FDI minus outward FDI) was 
higher at US$ 15.4 billion in April-December 2008 as compared with US$ 6.9 
billion in April-December 2007.

(v) Portfolio investment comprising mainly foreign institutional investors (FIIs) 
investments and American depository receipts (ADRs)/global depository receipts 
(GDRs) witnessed large net outflows of US$ 11.3 billion during April-December 
2008 (net inflows of US$ 33.3 billion in April-December 2007) due to large sales of 
equities by FIIs in the Indian stock market reflecting bearish market conditions and  13
slowdown in the global economy. The inflows under ADRs/ GDRs 
slowed down to US$ 1.1 billion in April-December 2008 (US$ 8.4 billion in April-
December 2007).

(vi) Net external commercial borrowings (ECBs) inflow slowed down to US$ 7.1 billion 
in April-December 2008 (US$ 17.4 billion in April-December 2007) mainly due to 
tight liquidity conditions in the overseas markets.  
(vii) Banking capital (net), including NRI deposits, turned marginally negative to US$ 
0.1 billion during April-December 2008 as against net inflows of US$ 5.9 billion 
during April-December 2007. Among the components of banking capital, NRI 
deposits witnessed a net inflow of US$ 2.1 billion in April-December 2008, a 
turnaround from net outflow of US$ 0.9 billion in April-December 2007. 
(viii) Gross disbursement of short-term trade credit stood at US$ 31.4 billion during 
April-December 2008 (US$ 32.2 billion in April-December 2007). Repayments of 
short-term trade credit were high at US$ 30.8 billion during April-December 2008 
(as compared with US$ 21.5 billion during April-December 2007) due to some 
problems in rollover observed during the third quarter. Net short-term trade credit 
stood at US$ 0.5 billion (inclusive of suppliersí credit up to 180 days) during April-
December 2008 as compared with US$ 10.7 billion during the same period of the 
previous year.  
(ix) Other capital includes leads and lags in exports, funds held abroad, advances 
received pending for issue of shares under FDI and other capital not included

Variation in Reserves 
(i) The decline in foreign exchange reserves on BoP basis (i.e., excluding valuation) 
was US$ 20.4 billion in April-December 2008 (as against accretion to reserves of 
US$ 67.2 billion in April-December 2007) (Table 14 & Chart 5). Taking into

(iii) To sum up, the key features of Indiaís BoP that emerged in April-December 2008 
were: (i) widening of trade deficit led by high growth in imports and slowdown in 
exports, (ii) increase in invisibles surplus, led by remittances from overseas 
Indians and software services exports, which financed about 65 per cent of trade 
deficit, (iii) higher current account deficit due to large trade deficit,  (iv) lower net 
capital flows mainly led by large net outflows under portfolio investment and large 
repayments under short-term trade credit, and  (v) sharp decline in reserves. The 
details of key indicators are set out in Table 15.
