RBI’s Platinum Jubilee Celebrations: 
Symposium on Changing Dynamics of Legal Risks in the Financial System 
Dr. D. Subbarao, Governor, Reserve Bank of India urged the legal community 
in banking and financial sector to determine the reforms required on the legal side to 
make the financial sector healthy, resilient and growth promoting. Stating that the 
global financial crisis had thrown up a number of issues relating to the regulation of 
the financial sector, Dr. Subbarao pointed out that a lot of analysis and thinking was 
going into the ways of preventing mistakes and excesses that led to the crisis.  The 
legal aspects of the proposed reforms were an important dimension of the whole 
exercise and it was necessary to determine the reforms required on the legal side to 
make the financial sector healthy, resilient and growth promoting. Dr. Subbarao said 
this in his message to the legal fraternity in banking and financial sector who had
