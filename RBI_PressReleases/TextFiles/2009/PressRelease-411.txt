Indiaís External Debt as at the end of June 2009 
As per the extant practice, India's external debt statistics for the quarters ending 
March and June are compiled and released by the Reserve Bank of India and for the 
quarters ending September and December are compiled and released by the Ministry of 
Finance, Government of India. The external debt statistics are released with a lag of one 
quarter. A detailed account of external debt as compiled in the standard format as at end-
June 2009 in rupee and US dollar terms and revised data for the earlier quarters are set 
out in Statement 1 and 2, respectively. 
Major Highlights of External Debt 
(i) Indiaís external debt  stood at US$ 227.7 billion at the end of June 2009. The 
increase in external debt by US$ 3.7 billion over end-March 2009 level was mainly 
due to increase in long term external debt, particularly Non-Resident Indian (NRI) 
deposits. 
(ii) Excluding the valuation effects due to depreciation of US dollar against other 
major currencies and Indian rupee during the first quarter of the financial year 
2009-10, the stock of external debt as at end-June 2009 would have declined by 
US$ 1.3 billion as compared to the stock as at end-March 2009. 
(iii) The share of US dollar denominated debt in the total external debt declined to 
54.4 per cent as at end-June 2009 from 56.3 per cent as at end-March 2009. 
(iv) Based on the original maturity, the share of short-term to total debt declined to 
17.8 per cent at end-June 2009 from 19.5 per cent at end-March 2009.  
(v) Based on the residual maturity, the short-term debt accounted for 39.1 per cent of 
the total external debt at end-June 2009. 
(vi) The share of non-Government debt in the total external debt declined marginally to 
74.8 per cent as at end-June 2009 from 75.5 per cent as at end-March 2009.   
(vii) The debt service ratio declined steadily during the last three years and stood at 
4.6 per cent as at end-March 2009. The debt service ratio for April-June 2009 
worked out to 5.5 per cent.  
1. Indiaís External Debt as at the end of June 2009 
(i) Indiaís external debt was placed at US$ 227.7 billion at the end of June 2009 as 
compared to US$ 224.0 billion as at end of March 2009. The increase in the 
external debt outstanding as at end-June 2009 by US$ 3.7 billion or 1.7 per cent 
over the end-March 2009 level was mainly due to the increase in long term external 
debt, particularly Non-Resident Indian (NRI) deposits (Table 1 and Chart 1). The 
external debt outstanding as at end-June 2009 increased by          US$ 3.4 billion or 
1.5 per cent over the end-June 2008 level.

2. Valuation Changes 
(i) The valuation effect reflecting the depreciation of the US dollar against other major 
international currencies and Indian rupee during the first quarter of the financial year 
2009-10 resulted in an increase in the external debt by US$ 5.0 billion as compared 
to the end-March 2009 level. This implies that excluding the valuation effect, the 
stock of external debt as at end-June 2009 would have declined by US$ 1.3 billion 
over the end-March 2009 level. 
3. Components of External Debt 
(i) By way of composition of external debt, the share of commercial borrowings (27.7 
per cent) continued to be the highest followed by NRI deposits (19.6 per cent), 
multilateral debt (18.1 per cent), short-term debt (17.8 per cent) and bilateral debt 
(9.4 per cent) as at end-June 2009 (Table 2).

(ii) The long-term debt at US$ 187.1 billion and short-term debt at US$ 40.6 billion 
accounted for 82.2 per cent and 17.8 per cent, respectively, of the total external 
debt as at end-June 2009. 
(iii) The increase in long-term debt by US$ 6.7 billion as at end June 2009 was mainly 
due to the increase in NRI deposits. 
(iv) External commercial borrowings showed a marginal increase of US$ 645 million 
over end-March 2009, mainly due to increase in commercial bank loans and FII 
investment in Government securities and corporate bonds. 
(v) Short-term debt at US$ 40.6 billion, however, declined by US$ 3.0 billion as at end-
June 2009 as compared to the level of end-March 2009 mainly on account of 
decline in short-term  trade credit (up to 6 months) (Table 3 and Chart 2).     
(vi) Short-term trade credit stood lower at US$ 37.1 billion as at end-June 2009 as 
compared with US$ 40.2 billion at end-March 2009.  
(vii) Outstanding NRI deposits at US$ 44.6 billion as at end-June 2009 increased by 
US$ 3.0 billion over the level at end-March 2009 on account of increase in inflows 
under NRI deposit schemes reflecting a positive influence of hike in ceiling interest 
rates in a phased manner during 2008-09.

  # :  Based on date of agreement of the loan which may differ from the date of granting the loan 
registration number by the RBI.  Ceiling on ECB approvals is fixed on the basis of the latter, 
which may either be after or before the date of agreement of the loan.  Hence, there may be 
some difference between the amount shown under approvals in the table and the amount of 
ceiling fixed for a particular year. 
Note:  Disbursements during 1998-99 and 2000-01 include RIBs (US$ 4.2 billion) and IMDs (US$ 
5.5 billion), respectively. Debt service payments during 2003-04 and 2005-06 include redemption of 
RIBs and IMDs, respectively. 
5. Currency Composition 
(i) While the US dollar is generally used as the numeraire currency for computing 
external debt in order to facilitate international comparison, the currency 
composition of the external debt is essential to understand the currencies in which 
the debt is actually denominated. It gives an idea of the extent of exposure of the 
economy to cross currency exchange rate movements. The currency composition of 
Indiaís external debt is generally disseminated in terms of major foreign currencies 
such as US dollar, Japanese Yen, Euro, Pound Sterling, Special Drawing Rights 
(SDR) and the domestic currency i.e., Indian Rupee.  
(ii) The US dollar continues to remain the predominant currency accounting for 54.4 
per cent of the total external debt stock as at end-June 2009. However, there was a 
decline in the share of US dollar dominated external debt as compared to its share 
in the external debt as at end-March 2009.  6 
 
(iii) There was an increase in the share of Japanese yen (14.6 per cent), Indian rupee 
(14.3 per cent), SDR (9.6 per cent) and Euro (4.4 per cent) in the total external debt 
as at end-June 2009 as compared to its share in the external debt as at end-March 
2009 (Table 5 and Chart 3).

7. Short-term Debt  
(i) The short-term debt has become an important component for measuring the 
liquidity and refinancing risks. In the recent years, efforts have been made to 
expand the coverage of short-term external debt. The data on short-term debt now 
includes suppliersí credit up to and above 180 days, FII investments in Government 
debt, investment by foreign central banks and international institutions in Treasury 
Bills and external liabilities of central banks and commercial banks.  
(ii) Short-term debt by original maturity as at end-June 2009 declined to US$ 40.6 
billion as against US$ 43.6 billion as at end-March 2009 mainly due to decline in 
short-term trade credits.  
(iii) The share of trade related credits in total short-term debt stood at 91.3 per cent as 
at end-June 2009.  8 
 
(iv) The ratio of trade credits to imports declined to 13.6 per cent as at end-March 2009 
as against 16.3 per cent as at end-March 2008 (Table 7).

8. External Debt by Residual Maturity 
(i) While external debt is generally compiled in terms of original maturity, analysing the 
external debt, in particular, short term debt in terms of residual maturity is important 
from the point of view of foreign exchange liquidity management and to ascertain 
the total foreign exchange outgo on account of debt service payments in the 
immediate future.  
(ii) The ëshort-term debt by residual maturityí comprises repayments due under medium 
and long-term debt by original maturity during one year reference period along with 
the short-term debt with original maturity. The balance constitutes the long-term 
debt by residual maturity.  
(iii) As at end-March 2009, the revised short-term debt by residual maturity stood at 
US$ 87.5 billion, which has increased to US$ 89.1 billion as at end-June 2009.  
(iv) Based on residual maturity, the short-term debt accounted for 39.1 per cent of total 
external debt as at end-June 2009. The ratio of short-term debt by residual maturity 
to foreign exchange reserves worked out to 33.6 per cent at end-June 2009 (Table 
8).

10. Debt Service Payments  
(i) Indiaís debt service ratio has improved progressively over the years owing to the 
combined effect of moderation in debt service payments and growth in external 
current receipts. The debt service ratio had declined from a peak of 35.3 per cent in 
1990-91 to 5.9 per cent in 2004-05 but increased to 10.1 per cent during 2005-06 
due to repayments relating to the India Millennium Deposits. The debt service ratio 
declined to 4.6 per cent during 2008-09.  The debt service ratio for April-June 2009 
stood at 5.5 per cent (Table 10).

11. Sustainability of Indiaís External Debt 
(i) An assessment of sustainability of external debt is generally undertaken based on 
the trends in certain key ratios such as debt to GDP ratio, debt service ratio, short-
term debt to total debt and total debt to foreign exchange reserves. India has 
managed its external debt successfully as reflected in the perceptible improvement 
in various external debt sustainability indicators (Table 12).  
(ii) The ratio of external debt to GDP has increased  to 21.4 per cent as at end-March 
2009 from 18.9 per cent as at end-March 2008.  
(iii) The debt service ratio declined steadily during the last three years and stood at 4.6 
per cent as at end-March 2009. The debt service ratio for April-June 2009 worked 
out to 5.5 per cent. 
(iv) Indiaís foreign exchange reserves provide a cover of 116.5 per cent to the external 
debt stock at the end of June 2009 as compared to 112.5 per cent at end-March 
2009 (Chart 5).  
(v) The share of concessional debt in total external debt increased marginally to 19.0 
per cent as at end-June 2009 from 18.7 per cent at end-March 2009. 12 
 
(vi) The ratio of short-term debt to foreign exchange reserves at 15.3 per cent as at 
end-June 2009 was lower compared to 17.3 per cent as at end-March 2009. 
(vii)  The ratio of short-term to total debt declined to 17.8 per cent at end-June 2009 
from 19.5 per cent at end-March 2009.
