Reserve Bank Cancels the Licence of Suvidha Mahila Nagrik Sahakari Bank 
Maryadit, Hoshangabad (M.P) 
In view of the fact that Suvidha Mahila Nagrik Sahakari Bank Maryadit, 
Hoshangabad (M.P), had ceased to be solvent, all efforts to revive it in close consultation 
with the Government of Madhya Pradesh had failed and the depositors were being 
inconvenienced by continued uncertainty, the Reserve Bank of India delivered the order 
canceling its licence to the bank after the close of business on October 21, 2009. The 
Registrar of Co-operative Societies, Madhya Pradesh State has also been requested to 
issue an order for winding up the bank and appoint a liquidator for the bank. It may be 
highlighted that on liquidation, every depositor is entitled to repayment of his/her deposits 
up to a monetary ceiling of Rs. 1,00,000/- (Rupees one lakh only) from the Deposit 
Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) under usual terms and conditions.  
The bank was granted a licence by Reserve Bank on November 20, 1996 to 
commence banking business. The statutory inspection of the bank with reference to its 
position as on December 31, 2003 had indicated that its financial position was impaired, 
and it was issued directions under Section 35 A of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (As 
applicable to Co-operative Societies) from the close of business of October 5, 2004, 
restricting its operations. Subsequent inspections i.e. March 31, 1005, March 31, 2006 and 
March 31, 2007 also revealed that the bank's financial position deteriorated further. 
The Reserve Bank of India issued a show cause notice to the bank on December 
24, 2007, asking it to show cause as to why the licence granted to it to conduct banking 
business should not be cancelled. The reply to the show cause notice was examined. The 
bank did not have a viable plan of action for its revival. In the absence of any viable 
proposal to turn around and achieve the required regulatory prescriptions the possibility of 
revival of the bank was remote. Therefore, the Reserve Bank of India took the extreme 
measure of cancelling licence of the bank in the interest of the bank's depositors. With the 
cancellation of its licence and commencement of liquidation proceedings, the process of 
paying the depositors of Suvidha Mahila Nagrik Sahakari Bank Maryadit, Hoshangabad 
(M.P), will be set in motion subject to the terms and conditions of the Deposit Insurance 
Scheme.  
Consequent to the cancellation of its licence, Suvidha Mahila Nagrik Sahakari Bank 
Maryadit, Hoshangabad (M.P), is prohibited from carrying on ëbanking businessí as defined 
in Section 5(b) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (AACS) including acceptance and 
repayment of deposits.

Manager, Urban Banks Department, Reserve Bank of India, Bhopal. His contact details are
