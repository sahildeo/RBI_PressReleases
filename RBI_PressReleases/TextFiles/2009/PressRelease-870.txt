Reserve Bank Cancels the Licence of  The Katkol Co-operative Bank 
Ltd., Katkol, Karnataka 
In view of the fact that the Katkol Co-operative Bank Ltd., Katkol, (Karnataka) had 
ceased to be solvent, all efforts to revive it in close consultation with the Government of 
Karnataka had failed and the depositors of the bank were being inconvenienced by 
continued uncertainty, the Reserve Bank of India delivered the order canceling its licence to 
the bank after the close of business on July 03, 2009. The Registrar of Co-operative 
Societies, Karnataka has also been requested to issue an order for winding up of the bank 
and appoint a Liquidator for the bank. It may be highlighted that on liquidation every 
depositor is entitled to repayment of his deposits up to a monetary ceiling of Rs.1,00,000/- 
from the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC).    
The bank was granted a licence by Reserve Bank on November 09, 1987 to 
commence banking business.  The statutory inspection conducted with reference to the 
financial position as on March 31, 2005 revealed that the bank was facing severe liquidity 
problem. In view of the critical liquidity position and various other deficiencies observed 
during the inspection,  in order to protect the interest of the depositors,  the bank was 
placed under directions under Section 35A of the Banking Regulation Act 1949(AACS)  
vide order dated August 03, 2006.  
 The subsequent inspections of the bank conducted with reference to position as on 
March 31, 2006 and March 31, 2007 revealed further deterioration in the financials of the 
bank. Since it was reported that a proposal for merger with a sound bank was under way, it 
was decided to wait for a specific merger proposal.  
The statutory inspection of the bank carried out under Section 35 of the Act, with 
reference to its financial position as on March 31, 2008 revealed that the financial position 
of the bank had further deteriorated and was precarious. A notice was issued to the bank 
on February 11, 2009 asking it to show cause as to why the licence granted to it to conduct 
banking business should not be cancelled.  
After taking into consideration the reply submitted by the bank and after examining 
all options for its revival, the Reserve Bank of India took the extreme measure of canceling 
the licence of the bank in the interest of the bank's depositors.  With the cancellation of its 
licence and commencement of liquidation proceedings, the process of paying the 
depositors of the Katkol Co-operative Bank Ltd., the amount insured as per the DICGC Act 
will be set in motion. 
Consequent to the cancellation of its licence, the Katkol  Co-operative Bank Ltd. is 
prohibited from carrying on 'banking business' as defined in Section 5(b) of the Banking 
Regulation Act, 1949(AACS) including acceptance and repayment of deposits.

General Manager, Urban Banks Department, Reserve Bank of India, Bangalore. Her
