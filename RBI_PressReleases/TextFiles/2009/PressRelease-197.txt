supervisory and regulatory framework for emergence of such umbrella 
organisation(s) for UCBs. 
 
The Group interacted with all the federations / associations of urban 
cooperative banks, a cross section of urban cooperative banks, members of Task 
Forces for Urban Cooperative Banks and regulators of umbrella organisations 
abroad before finalising its own recommendations.
