Further Measures taken by RBI 
Extension of Time line for Forex Swap facility 
In November 2008, the Reserve Bank of India extended a forex swap facility for 
tenors up to three months to Indian public and private sector banks having overseas 
operations in order to provide them flexibility in managing their short term funding 
requirements at their overseas offices.  In view of the continuing uncertain credit 
conditions globally; the availability of the facility currently till June 30, 2009, is now 
extended to till March 31, 2010. 
Information sharing among banks under Multiple Banking Arrangement 
The several regulatory prescriptions regarding conduct of consortium/ multiple 
banking/ syndicate arrangements were withdrawn by the Reserve Bank of India in 
October 1996 with a view to introducing flexibility in the credit delivery system and to 
facilitate smooth flow of credit.  Borrowers were accordingly made free to bank with 
one or more banks of their choice.  However, in the light of irregularities and frauds 
which have taken place under multiple banking arrangements, concerns have arisen 
about non-availability of full exposure details of borrowing entities to the lending 
bankers. The matter has been examined by the Reserve Bank in consultation with the 
Indian Banks' Association (IBA) and a framework has been evolved for sharing of 
information amongst banks which have lent to borrowers banking with more than one 
bank. It comprises banks obtaining declaration from existing borrowers enjoying 
sanctioned limits of Rs. 5 crore and above regarding the credit facilities enjoyed by 
them from other banks.  Such declaration is also to be sought at the time of granting 
fresh facilities.  An elaborate system of exchange of information amongst lending 
banks has been put into place. The information sharing framework includes, among 
others, position in derivatives and unhedged forex exposure of borrowers.  The 
framework was put into public domain on September 19, 2008.  The framework was 
further discussed with IBA which has assured that banks will make full use of the 
information sharing framework mentioned above as also the credit information 
available with the Credit Information Bureau (of India) Ltd. (CIBIL) so as to provide 
sound credit culture.  
Measures concerning Restructuring of Advances 
On August 27, 2008, the Reserve Bank had issued comprehensive guidelines 
for restructuring of advances by banks.  Subsequently, in view of global 
developments, certain facilities were granted up to June 30, 2009 including eligibility 
of second restructuring and first restructuring of commercial real estate exposures for 
special regulatory treatment.  Further, banks were allowed to apply special regulatory 
treatment for accounts which were standard on September 1, 2008 and taken up for 
restructuring up to January 31, 2009 even if these had turned non-performing during 
this period.  It has been represented to the Reserve Bank that due to increased  2
workload, the banks have not been able to adhere to the January 31, 2009 time 
schedule.  It has, therefore, been decided to extend the time schedule for taking up 
restructuring to March 31, 2009.  All these are one-time measures and would be 
available for restructuring packages implemented till June 30, 2009.  Further, it is 
clarified that this treatment will be available to all accounts which were standard on 
September 1, 2008 and were eligible under restructuring in terms of the Reserve Bank 
circulars dated August 27, December 8, 2008 and January 2, 2009. 
Interest rates on export credit in foreign currency 
The ceiling on export credit in foreign currency is currently LIBOR + 100 basis 
points.  However, the banks' costs of raising funds abroad have increased because of 
which they are finding it difficult to extend credit within this ceiling.  It has, therefore, 
been decided, in consultation with the Government of India, to raise the ceiling rate on 
export credit in foreign currency to LIBOR + 350 basis points with immediate effect 
subject to the condition that the banks will not levy any other charges, i.e., service 
charge, management charge, etc. except for recovery towards out-of-pocket expenses 
incurred.  Similar changes may be effected in interest rates in cases where Euro 
LIBOR/ Euribor has been used as the benchmark.  Correspondingly, the ceiling 
interest rate on the lines of credit with overseas banks has also been increased from 6 
months LIBOR/ EURO LIBOR/ EURIBOR + 75 basis points to six months LIBOR/ 
EURO LIBOR/ EURIBOR + 150 basis points with immediate effect.
