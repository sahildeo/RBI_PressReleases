The Reserve Bank of India today released its 'Quarterly Statistics on Deposits and

(RRBs) as on last friday of September 2008 (i.e., September 26, 2008). The data are based 
on Basic Statistical Return (BSR) -7 received from the branches of all scheduled commercial

 The number of banked centres served by Scheduled Commercial Banks stood at 
34,506. Of these centres, 28,314 were single office centres and 57 centres had 100 or more 
bank offices.  
The top hundred centres, out of 34,506 banked centres, arranged according to the 
size of deposits accounted for 69.6 per cent of the total deposits and the top hundred 
centres arranged according to the size of bank credit accounted for 79.0 per cent of total 
bank credit. In September 2007, the corresponding share of top hundred centres in 
aggregate deposits and gross bank credit was 69.6 per cent and 77.2 per cent, respectively. 
Aggregate deposits of top hundred centres increased by 20.0 per cent in September 2008 
over September 2007 compared to a growth of 27.8 per cent recorded a year ago. Growth 
rate of gross bank credit of top hundred centres at 28.6 per cent in September 2008 was 
higher as compared to 22.8 per cent growth recorded in September 2007.  
The Top 200 centres in terms of aggregate deposits covered 31.3 per cent of 
reporting offices and 74.4 per cent of aggregate deposits. The Top 200 centres in terms of 
gross bank credit, accounted for 82.5 per cent of gross bank credit and 30.8 per cent of
