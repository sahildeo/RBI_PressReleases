Issuance of Government of India Cash Management Bills 
 
The Government of India, in consultation with the Reserve Bank of India, has 
decided to issue a new short-term instrument, known as Cash Management Bills, to 
meet the temporary cash flow mismatches of the Government. The Cash 
Management Bills will be non-standard, discounted instruments issued for maturities 
less than 91 days. 
 
The Cash Management Bills will have the generic character of Treasury Bills 
and their sale will be subject to the terms and conditions specified in the General 
Notification No. F.2 (12)-W&M/97 dated 31st March 1998 issued by Government of 
India and as amended from time to time. 
  
The Cash Management Bills will have the following features. 
 
a) The tenure, notified amount and date of issue of the proposed Cash 
Management Bills will depend upon the temporary cash requirement of the 
Government. However, the tenure of the proposed Bills will be less than 91 
days. 
b) The proposed Bills will be issued at discount to the face value through 
auctions, as in the case of the Treasury Bills. 
c) The announcement of the auction of the proposed Bills will be made by the 
Reserve Bank of India through separate Press Release to be issued one day 
prior to the date of auction.  
d) The settlement of the auction will be on T+1 basis. 
e) The Non-Competitive Bidding Scheme for Treasury Bills will not be extended 
to the Cash Management Bills. 
f) The proposed Bills will be tradable and qualify for ready forward facility. 
Investment in the proposed Bills will be reckoned as an eligible investment in 
Government Securities by banks for SLR purpose under Section 24 of the 
Banking Regulation Act, 1949.
