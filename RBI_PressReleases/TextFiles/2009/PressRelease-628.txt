Operationalisation of the Scheme of Non-Competitive Bidding  
in the Auction of State Development Loans 
 
The Reserve Bank of India, in consultation with the State Governments, has 
decided to operationalise the Scheme of Non- Competitive Bidding Facility in the 
auction of State Development Loans (SDLs) to widen the scope for participation of 
retail investors in the auction of SDLs. Under the Scheme, up to 10 percent of the 
notified amount of SDLs will be allotted to eligible individuals and institutions subject 
to a maximum of one percent of the notified amount for a single bid per stock. An 
investor can submit only a single bid in an auction of a SDL through a bank or a 
Primary Dealer. The Non- Competitive Bidding Scheme will be introduced in the 
auctions of the SDLs from the auction dated August 25, 2009. 
 
The Reserve Bank of India has also decided in consultation with the State 
Governments to introduce certain changes in bidding procedures to improving the 
overall efficiency in the primary market auctions of the State Governments securities. 
Accordingly, all competitive bids shall be submitted electronically on the Negotiated 
Dealing System (NDS) between 10.30 AM and 12.30 PM on the day of the auction. 
Persons, other than NDS members, shall route their competititve bids through an 
NDS member. No bids shall be accepted in physical format, except in extraordinary 
situations as may be specified by the Reserve bank of India.  Non-Competitive bids 
shall be submitted electronically on the NDS between 10.30 AM and 11.30 AM on 
the day of the auction. 
 
The above changes will be operational with the auctions to be held from 
August 25, 2009.
