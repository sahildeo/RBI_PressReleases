Sources of Variation in Foreign Exchange  
Reserves in India: April-June 2009-10 
Earlier today, the Reserve Bank of India released the Balance of Payments 
(BoP) data for Q1 of 2009-10 (i.e., April-June) on its website (www.rbi.org.in). On the 
basis of these data, this note on sources of variation in foreign exchange reserves 
during April-June 2009 has been compiled. 
Sources of Variation in Foreign Exchange Reserves: April-June 2009 
During April-June 2009, there was an accretion to foreign exchange reserves 
largely reflecting valuation changes. The sources of variation in the foreign exchange 
reserves are set out in Table 1.

Note: Increase in reserves (+)/Decrease in reserves (-). 
The foreign exchange reserves (including the valuation effects) increased by 
US$ 13,157 million during April-June 2009 as compared with an increase of US$ 
2,364 million during April-June 2008 (Table 2). On balance of payments basis (i.e., 
excluding valuation effects), the foreign exchange reserves increased by US$ 115 
million during April-June 2009 as compared with an increase of US$ 2,235 million 
during April-June 2008. The valuation gain, reflecting the depreciation of the US 
dollar against the major currencies, accounted for US$ 13,042 million during April-
June 2009 as compared with a valuation gain of US$ 129 million during April-June 
2008. Accordingly, valuation gain during April-June 2009 accounts for 99.1 per cent 
of the total increase in foreign exchange reserves. Inflows under FDI, portfolio 
investments and NRI deposits were the major sources contributing to the increase in 
foreign exchange reserves, which was mostly offset by current account deficit and 
outflows under other items of the capital account during April-June 2009.
