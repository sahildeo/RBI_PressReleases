Reserve Bank Cancels the Licence of Suvarna Nagari Sahakari Bank Ltd., Parbhani  
In view of the fact that Suvarna Nagari Sahakari Bank Ltd., Parbhani, (Maharashtra) 
had ceased to be solvent, all efforts to revive it in close consultation with the Government of 
Maharashtra had failed and the depositors of the bank were being inconvenienced by 
continued uncertainty, the Reserve Bank of India delivered the order, canceling its licence 
to the bank after the close of business on February 20, 2009 The Registrar of Co-operative 
Societies, Maharashtra has also been requested to issue an order for winding up of the 
bank and appoint a Liquidator for the bank. It may be highlighted that on liquidation every 
depositor is entitled to repayment of his deposits up to a monetary ceiling of Rs.1,00,000/- 
(Rupees One Lakh only) from the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation 
(DICGC).  
The bank was granted a licence by the Reserve Bank on January 04, 1996 to 
commence banking business. The statutory inspection of the bank conducted by RBI with 
reference to its financial position as on March 31, 2005 revealed that the bank was not 
complying with several provisions of the Banking Regulation Act 1949 (As applicable to 
Cooperative Societies) and had also violated several RBI guidelines / instructions. The 
realizable value of capital and reserves (Net Worth) of the bank had become negative. The 
bank was placed under directions under Section 35A of the Banking Regulation Act 1949 
(As Applicable to Cooperative Societies) vide order dated April 19, 2006 precluding it from 
incurring any liability. 
The bank failed to make a turn around. Therefore, the Reserve Bank issued a notice 
to the bank on November 3, 2008 asking it to show cause as to why the licence granted to 
it under Section 22 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (As Applicable to Cooperative 
Societies) on January 04, 1996 to conduct banking business should not be cancelled. The 
bank's reply to the show cause notice was examined and was found unacceptable. 
As the realizable value of bank's paid-up capital and reserves was negative and the 
chances of its revival were remote in the absence of a viable action plan, the Reserve Bank 
of India took the extreme measure of canceling licence of the bank after examining all 
options for its revival, in the interest of the bank's depositors. With the cancellation of its 
licence and commencement of liquidation proceedings, the process of paying the 
depositors of Suvarna Nagari Sahakari Bank Ltd., Parbhani, (Maharashtra), the amount 
insured as per the DICGC Act will be set in motion. 
Consequent to the cancellation of its licence, Suvarna Nagari Sahakari Bank Ltd., 
Parbhani, (Maharashtra) is prohibited from carrying on 'banking business' as defined in 
Section 5(b) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949(As Applicable to Cooperative Societies) 
including acceptance and repayment of deposits.  
For any clarifications, depositors may approach Shri Shreedhar Behera, Deputy 
General Manager, Urban Banks Department, Reserve Bank of India, Nagpur. His contact 
details are as below:
