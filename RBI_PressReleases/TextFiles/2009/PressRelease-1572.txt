Reserve Bank Cancels the Licence of  Deendayal  Nagrik Sahakari Bank 
Maryadit, Khandwa, (M.P) 
In view of the fact that Deendayal Nagrik Sahakari Bank Maryadit, Khandwa, 
(M.P) had ceased to be solvent, all efforts to revive it in close consultation with the 
Government of Madhya Pradesh had failed and the depositors were being 
inconvenienced by continued uncertainty, the Reserve Bank of India delivered the 
order cancelling its licence to the bank after the close of business on March 4, 2009.  
The Registrar of Co-operative Societies, Madhya Pradesh State has also been 
requested to issue an order for winding up the bank and appoint a liquidator for the 
bank.  It may be highlighted that on liquidation every depositor is entitled to 
repayment of his deposits up to a monetary ceiling of Rs.1,00,000/- from the Deposit 
Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC).  
The statutory inspection of the bank conducted by the Reserve Bank of India 
under Section 35 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (As applicable to Cooperative 
Societies) with reference to its financial position as on 31.03.2005 revealed 
deterioration in its financial position.  
The inspection of the bank with reference to its position as on March 31, 
2008, revealed serious deficiencies / irregularities and deterioration in its financial 
condition.  Thereafter, the Reserve Bank issued a notice to the bank on September 
10, 2008, asking it to show cause as to why the licence granted to it to conduct 
banking business should not be cancelled.  Considering its unsatisfactory financial 
position, the bank was placed under directions, in terms of sub-section (1) of Section 
35A of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (AACS) vide orders dated September 10, 
2008. As the bank did not have a viable plan of action for revival and the chances of 
its revival were remote, the Reserve Bank of India took the extreme measure of 
cancelling licence of the bank after examining all options for its revival, in the interest 
of the bank's depositors.  With the cancellation of its licence and after 
commencement of liquidation proceedings, the process of paying the depositors of 
Deendayal Nagrik Sahakari Bank Maryadit, Khandwa, (M.P), the amount insured as 
per the DICGC Act, will be set in motion.   
Consequent to the cancellation of its licence, Deendayal Nagrik Sahakari 
Bank Maryadit,  Khandwa, (M.P), is  prohibited  from carrying  on  ëbanking businessí  
as defined in Section 5(b) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (AACS) including 
acceptance and repayment of deposits.
