India's Balance of Payments Developments during the Second Quarter 
(July-September 2009) of 2009-10 and Revisions in 2007-08, 2008-09 and First 
Quarter (April-June 2009) of 2009-10 
Preliminary data on Indiaís balance of payments (BoP) for the second quarter 
(Q2) i.e., July-September 2009 of the financial year 2009-10, are now available. These 
preliminary data and the partially revised data for the first quarter (Q1) i.e., April-June 
2009, have been taken into account for compiling the BoP data for the first half of the 
current financial year i.e., April-September 2009. Full details of these data are set out in 
the standard format of BoP presentation in Statements I and II.  
As per the revision policy, the data on Indiaís BoP for previous two years are 
revised only once in a year when the data of July-September quarter are published in 
end-December (i.e., December 31). For example, the data for the financial years   
2007-08 and 2008-09 have been revised now. The data for 2007-08 is now final and is 
frozen, except in extraordinary circumstances in the event of methodological changes in 
respect of data collection and compilation procedures and/or significant changes 
indicated by data sources that could cause structural shift in the data series. The data 
for the financial year 2008-09 is now partially revised. This will be finalized and frozen in 
December 2010. Data revisions for the previous quarters of the same financial year are 
also undertaken while compiling data for the current quarter. Accordingly, the revisions 
of the data on BoP for the first quarter of 2009-10 have been undertaken. 
1. Major Highlights  
(i) Growth in exports and imports continued their declining trend during Q2 of        
2009-10.  
(ii) Trade deficit, however, was lower reflecting larger fall in imports, especially oil 
imports, on account of lower oil prices as compared to last year. 
(iii) Private transfer receipts continued to be sustained through Q2 of 2009-10. 
Software services exports, however, were lower. 
(iv) Despite lower trade deficit, current account deficit at US$ 12.6 billion in Q2 of 
2009-10 was almost at the same level as last year, mainly on account of lower net 
invisibles surplus. During April-September 2009, the current account deficit stood 
higher at US$ 18.6 billion. 
(v) Net capital flows were higher during April-September 2009 mainly driven by 
foreign investment inflows, particularly reflecting the turnaround in FII inflows. NRI 
deposits also witnessed higher inflows. 
(vi) Higher capital inflows along with the allocations of SDRs by the IMF resulted in an 
increase in the Indiaís foreign exchange reserves by US$ 9.5 billion on a BoP 
basis (i.e. excluding valuation) during April-September 2009. Including the 
valuation changes, the increase in reserves was higher at US$ 29.3 billion during 
the same period.   2

Merchandise Trade 
(i) The decline in exports which started since October 2008 continued during the 
second quarter of 2009-10. On a BoP basis, Indiaís merchandise exports 
recorded a decline of 21.0 per cent in Q2 of 2009-10 as against an increase of 
39.6 per cent in Q2 of 2008-09. 
(ii) Import payments, on a BoP basis, registered a decline of 19.6 per cent in Q2 of 
2009-10 as against a higher growth of 54.8 per cent in the corresponding period of 
last year.  
(iii) According to the data released by the Directorate General of Commercial 
Intelligence and Statistics (DGCI&S), both oil imports and non-oil imports 
witnessed a decline during Q2 of 2009-10 by 45.7 per cent and 27.5 per cent, 
respectively. The decline in oil imports was mainly due to significant decline in oil 
prices to US$ 67.6 per barrel during Q2 of 2009-10 from its peak of US$ 132.5 per 
barrel in July 2008 (Chart 1). Oil imports in Q2 of 2009-10 accounted for about 
28.7 per cent of total imports (35.0 per cent in Q2 of 2008-09).

Trade Deficit 
(i) Trade deficit on a BoP basis was lower at US$ 32.2 billion in Q2 of 2009-10 as 
compared to US$ 39.1 billion in Q2 of 2008-09 (Chart 2). 
 
 
 
 
Invisibles 
 
(i) Invisible receipts, comprising services, current transfers and income, registered a 
decline of 15.1 per cent in Q2 of 2009-10 (as against a higher growth of 33.1 per 
cent in Q2 of 2008-09). Major categories of services exports registered a decline 
during the quarter. Receipts under non-software miscellaneous services including 
business services, construction and royalties, copy rights and licence fees 
declined. Private transfers receipts, however, increased by 3.6 per cent during the 
quarter. 
 
(ii) Invisible payments recorded a marginal increase during Q2 of 2009-10 mainly on 
account of payments under business and financial services. 
 
(iii) Net invisibles (invisibles receipts minus invisibles payments) turned out to be 
lower at US $ 19.6 billion in Q2 of 2009-10 (US $ 26.5 billion in Q2 of 2008-09) 
mainly due to decline in services exports, particularly non-software services 
receipts (Table 2). At this level, net invisibles surplus financed 60.8 per cent of 
trade deficit in Q2 of 2009-10 (67.9 per cent in Q2 of 2008-09).

Current Account Deficit 
 
(i) Despite lower trade deficit, current account deficit at US$ 12.6 billion in Q2 of 
2009-10 was almost at the same level as last year, mainly on account of lower net 
invisibles surplus. The invisibles surplus, however, continued to be driven by 
private transfers and software exports.  
 
Capital Account and Reserves 
 
(i) Both gross capital inflows and outflows remained strong during Q2 of 2009-10.  
The gross capital inflows to India during Q2 of 2009-10 amounted to US $ 98.1 
billion (US $ 90.0 billion in Q2 of 2008-09) mainly on account higher foreign 
investment inflows of US$ 55.8 billion.  
(ii) Net capital flows were also substantially higher at US $ 23.6 billion in Q2 of 2009-
10 than that of US $ 7.1 billion in Q2 of 2008-09 mainly due to large net foreign 
investment inflows and SDR allocations by the IMF during the quarter (Table 3).

(iii) Foreign direct investments (FDI) broadly comprise equity, reinvested earnings and 
inter-corporate loans. Net FDI flows (net inward FDI minus net outward FDI) were 
higher at US $ 7.1 billion in Q2 of 2009-10 as compared with US $ 4.9 billion in Q2 
of 2008-09. Net inward FDI remained buoyant at US $ 11.3 billion during Q2 of 
2009-10 (US $ 8.8 billion in Q2 of 2008-09) reflecting relatively better growth 
prospects of the Indian economy. Net outward FDI amounted to US $ 4.2 billion in 
Q2 of 2009-10 (US $ 3.9 billion in Q2 of 2008-09). 
(iv) Portfolio investment primarily comprising foreign institutional investorsí (FIIs) 
investments and American Depository Receipts (ADRs)/Global Depository 
Receipts (GDRs) continued their strong upward trend to record a net inflow of US 
$ 9.7 billion in Q2 of 2009-10 (as against net outflows of US $ 1.3 billion in Q2 of 
2008-09) mainly due to revival of FII inflows since the Q1 of 2009-10. Inflows 
under portfolio investment were led by large purchases of equities (amounting to 
US$ 7.0 billion during Q2 of 2009-10) by FIIs in the Indian stock market and 
revival in net inflows under ADRs/GDRs due to growth of stock prices of Indian 
companies. 
(v) According to the guidelines given in the Sixth Edition of the Balance of Payments 
Manual (BPM6) of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), allocations under 
special drawing rights (SDR) are treated as liabilities to nonresidents (foreign 
liabilities) and reported as liabilities under other investments of the financial 
account of the balance of payments. Accordingly, a general allocation of SDRs 
3,082.5 million on August 28, 2009 and a special allocation of SDRs 214.6 million 
together amounting to US$ 5.2 billion is included in the ëother capitalí of the capital 
account of the balance of payments for Q2 of 2009-10. The allocations have a 
debit entry in the reserve assets of the balance of payments showing an equal 
amount of increase in the foreign exchange reserves. 
(vi) Foreign exchange reserves, on BoP basis (i.e., excluding valuation) have shown 
an accretion of US $ 9.4 billion in Q2 of 2009-10 as against a decline in reserves 
of US $ 4.7 billion in Q2 of 2008-09. The increase in the reserves was mainly due 
to large capital inflows and SDR allocations by the IMF.

3. Balance of Payments (BoP) for April-September 2009 
(i) As alluded to earlier, taking into account the partially revised data for Q1 of 2009-
10 and the preliminary data for Q2 of 2009-10, the BoP data for the first half of the 
financial year 2009-10 (April-September) have been compiled. While the detailed 
data are set out in Statements I and II in standard format of BoP presentation, the 
major items are presented in Table 4.

 P: Preliminary.       PR: Partially Revised.         R: Revised. 
Merchandise Trade 
(i) On a BoP basis, Indiaís merchandise exports posted a decline of 27.0 per cent in 
April-September 2009 (as against a growth of 48.1 per cent in the corresponding 
period of the previous year). 
(ii) Import payments, on a BoP basis, declined by 20.6 per cent during April-
September 2009 as against a sharp increase of 51.0 per cent in the 
corresponding period of the previous year. The decline in imports is mainly 
attributed to the base effect and decline in oil prices. 
(iii) According to the DGCI&S data, oil imports recorded a decline of 45.0 per cent in 
April-September 2009 as against a significant rise of 83 per cent during April-
September 2008.  During the same period, non-oil imports showed a relatively 
modest decline of 26.3 per cent (as against an increase of 43.8 per cent in April-
September 2008). In absolute terms, the oil imports accounted for about 26 per 
cent of total imports during April-September 2009 (34.2 per cent in the 
corresponding period of the previous year).  
(iv) According to the data released by the Gem & Jewellery Export Promotion Council, 
total import of gems and jewellery declined by 12 per cent during April-September 
2009 as against an increase of 33.6 per cent during the corresponding period of 
last year.   
Trade Deficit 
(i) On a BoP basis, the merchandise trade deficit remained lower at US $ 58.2 billion 
during April-September 2009 as compared with US $ 64.4 billion in April-
September 2008 mainly on account of decline in oil import (Chart 2). 
Invisibles 
Invisibles Receipts 
(i) Invisible receipts recorded a decline of 11.6 per cent during April-September 2009 
as compared with an increase of 32.5 per cent in the corresponding period of the  7
previous year, mainly attributed to the lower receipts under almost all components 
of services (Table 5 and Chart 3). However, the private transfers receipts, which 
had marginally declined during the second half of 2008-09, increased by 4.3 per 
cent in the first half of 2009-10.

Note: Details of Non-software services under Miscellaneous (Item 5) are given in Table 8. 
 
(ii) Private transfers  are mainly in the form of (i) Inward remittances from Indian 
workers abroad for family maintenance, (ii) Local withdrawal from Non-Resident 
Indian Rupee deposits, (iii) Gold and silver brought through passenger baggage, 
and (iv) Personal gifts/donations to charitable/religious institutions. 
(iii) Private transfer receipts, comprising mainly remittances from Indians working 
overseas, increased to US $ 27.5 billion in April-September 2009 as compared 
with US $ 26.4 billion in the corresponding period of the previous year. Private 
transfer receipts constituted 17.6 per cent of current receipts in April-September 
2009 (13.4 per cent in the corresponding period of the previous year).  8
 
(iv) NRI deposits, when withdrawn domestically, form part of private transfers because 
once withdrawn for local use these become unilateral transfers and do not have 
any quid pro quo. Such local withdrawals/redemptions from NRI deposits cease to 
exist as liability in the capital account of the balance of payments and assume the 
form of private transfers, which is included in the current account of balance of 
payments. 
(v) Under the NRI deposits, both inflows as well as outflows remained steady in the 
recent past. A major part of outflows from NRI deposits is in the form of local 
withdrawals. These withdrawals, however, are not actually repatriated but are 
utilised domestically. During April-September 2009, the share of local withdrawals 
in total outflows from NRI deposits was 63.4 per cent as compared with 64.9 per 
cent in April-September 2008 (Table 6).

(viii) Miscellaneous receipts, excluding software exports, stood at US $ 7.8 billion in 
April-September 2009 (US $ 14.9 billion in April-September 2008). Receipts under 
non-software miscellaneous services like business services, construction and

(ix) The key components of the business services receipts and payments were mainly 
the trade related services, business and management consultancy services, 
architectural, engineering and other technical services and services relating to 
maintenance of offices (Table 9). Under business services, receipts of 
architectural, engineering and other technical services, maintenance of offices 
abroad and business and management consultancy services declined while 
payments related to these services rose moderately resulting in decline in net 
exports of these services. 
(x) Investment income receipts amounted to US $ 7.3 billion in April-September 2009 
and remained almost at same level of last year.

Invisibles Payments 
(i) Invisible payments have also shown a decline of 2.6 per cent in April-September 
2009 (an increase of 15.0 per cent in April-September 2008). The invisibles 
payments declined mainly due to lower payment towards travel, transportation, 
non-software services and private transfers.   
(ii) Lower transportation payments in April-September of 2009 (a decline of 29.4 per 
cent) mainly reflected the lower volume of imports. In addition, lower payments 
may also be attributed to the lower freight rates on international shipping as 
compared to corresponding period of last year.   
(iii) Investment income payments, reflecting mainly the interest payments on 
commercial borrowings, external assistance, non-resident deposits, and reinvested 
earnings of the foreign direct investment (FDI) enterprises operating in India, 
amounted to US $ 9.4 billion in April-September 2009 higher than that of April-
September 2008 (Table 10). The increase in investment income payments was 
mainly due to rise in reinvestment earnings of the FDI companies.

Invisibles Balance 
 
(i) Net invisibles (invisibles receipts minus invisibles payments) stood lower at US $ 
39.6 billion during April-September of 2009 as compared to US$ 48.5 billion 
during April-September 2008. At this level, the invisible surplus financed about 
68.0 per cent of trade deficit during April-September 2009 as against 75.4 per cent 
during April-September 2008. 
 
  11
Current Account Deficit 
(i) Despite lower trade deficits, current account deficit increased to US $ 18.6 billion 
in April-September 2009 from US $ 15.8 billion in April-September 2008 mainly 
due to lower net invisible surplus (Chart 4).   
  
 
 
Capital Account  
 
(i) The gross capital inflows to India during April-September 2009 amounted to US $ 
175.3 billion (US $ 184.4 billion in April-September 2008) as against an outflow of 
US $ 145.8 billion (US $ 172.5 billion in April-September 2008)    (Table 11).  
(ii) Net capital flows, however, at US $ 29.6 billion in April-September 2009 remained 
higher as compared with US $ 12.0 billion in April-September 2008. Under net 
capital flows, all the components except loans and banking capital, showed 
improvement during April-September 2009 from their level in the corresponding 
period of the previous year (Table 12). In banking capital, net inflows under non-
residentsí deposit remained higher during April-September 2009 as compared to 
their level last year. 
(iii) Net inward FDI into India remained buoyant at US $ 21.0 billion during April-
September 2009 (US $ 20.7 billion in April-September 2008) reflecting the 
continuing liberalisation and better growth performance of the Indian economy. 
During this period, FDI was channeled mainly into manufacturing (21.4 per cent) 
followed by communication services (12.8 per cent) and real estate sector (12.6 
per cent). Net outward FDI of India at US $ 6.8 billion in April-September 2009 
remained almost at the same level of the corresponding period of the last year. 
Due to large inward FDI, the net FDI (inward FDI minus outward FDI) was 
marginally higher at US$ 14.1 billion in April-September 2009.

(iv) Portfolio investment mainly comprising foreign institutional investors (FIIs)

(GDRs) witnessed large net inflows (US $ 17.9 billion) in April-September 2009 
(net outflows of US $ 5.5 billion in April-September 2008) due to large purchases 
by FIIs in the Indian capital market reflecting revival in growth prospects of the 
economy and improvement in global investorsí sentiment. The inflows under 
ADRs/ GDRs increased to US $ 2.7 billion in April-September 2009 (US $ 1.1 
billion in April-September 2008).

4. Reserves Variation 
(i) The accretion in foreign exchange reserves on BoP basis (i.e., excluding 
valuation) was US $ 9.5 billion in April-September 2009 (as against a decline of 
US $ 2.5 billion in April-September 2008) (Table 14 & Chart 5). Taking into 
account the valuation gain, foreign exchange reserves recorded an increase of US 
$ 29.3 billion in April-September 2009 (as against a decline in reserves of US $ 
23.4 billion in April-September 2008). [A Press Release on the sources of 
variation in foreign exchange reserves is separately issued]. 
(ii) The IMF had approved a general allocation of Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) for 
an amount equivalent to US$ 250 billion, which was made on August 28, 2009. In 
addition, a special SDR allocation pursuant to the fourth amendment of the IMFís 
Articles of Agreement, amounting to US $33 billion was made on September 9, 
2009. Pursuant to this, a general allocation of SDR 3,082 million (equivalent to 
US$ 4,821 million) and a special allocation of SDR 214.6 million (equivalent to 
US$ 340 million) were allocated to India by the IMF on August 28, 2009 and 
September 9, 2009, respectively. It has resulted in an increase in the Indiaís 
foreign exchange reserves by US$ 5.2 billion.  
(iii) At the end of September 2009, outstanding foreign exchange reserves stood at 
US $ 281.3 billion.

(iv) To sum up, the key features of Indiaís BoP that emerged in April-September 2009 
were: (i) lower trade deficit (US $ 58.2 billion) led by lower oil import bills, (ii) lower 
net invisible surplus (US $ 39.6 billion) led by lower software services and decline 
in business services and investment income, (iii) higher current account deficit 
(US $ 18.6 billion)  due to lower net invisibles, (iv) large net capital inflows mainly 
led by turnaround in FII inflows and steady FDI inflows, and (v) increase in 
reserves (excluding valuation) of US $ 9.5 billion (as against a decline in reserves 
of US $ 2.5 billion in April-September 2008) due to large capital inflows and SDRs 
allocations by the IMF. The details of key indicators are set out in Table 15.  15
