Reserve Bank to conduct the next auction-based OMO on July 9, 2009 
 
The Reserve Bank will conduct the next purchase auction under Open Market 
Operations (OMO) on July 9, 2009 (Thursday).  
 
It may be recalled that on March 26, 2009, the Reserve Bank had issued an 
indicative calendar for auction-based open market purchases of Government 
securities amounting to Rs.80,000 crore for the first half of the fiscal year 2009-10. It 
was stated, inter-alia, that the OMO purchase auctions would normally be conducted 
every alternate week on Thursdays but the Reserve Bank maintains the right to alter 
the frequency and day of auction as may be necessary according to market 
conditions.
