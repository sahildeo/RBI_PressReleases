Special Arrangements to give Liquidity Support to NBFCs extended 
 
 The facility of providing liquidity support to non-deposit taking but systemically 
important Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs-ND-SI) is now extended for any 
paper issued by NBFCs up to September 30, 2009. The Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) 
would cease to make fresh purchases after December 31, 2009 and would recover all 
dues by March 31, 2010. 
 
 Earlier, the facility was available for any paper issued by NBFCs till March 31, 
2009. It was later extended for papers issued up to June 30, 2009 and is now being 
extended to papers issued up to September 30, 2009. 
 
 It may be recalled that the Government of India, in January 2009, announced an 
arrangement for providing liquidity support to meet the temporary liquidity mismatches 
for eligible Non-Banking Financial Companies. The scheme was finalised for providing 
liquidity support to Non-Banking Financial Companies - Non-Deposit Taking-
Systemically Important (NBFCs-ND-SI) and Industrial Development Bank of India 
Stressed Asset Stabilisation Fund (IDBI SASF) Trust was notified as Special Purpose 
Vehicle for undertaking this operation. 
 
 Under the arrangement, the Reserve Bank of India offered to purchase securities 
issued by the SPV guaranteed by the Government of India for an aggregate amount of 
Rs.20,000 crore. The SPV would, on request from issuing NBFCs, directly purchase the 
short term paper, such as, commercial papers and non-convertible debentures, with 
residual maturity of not more than 90 days and rated as investment grade, from the 
issuing NBFCs.
