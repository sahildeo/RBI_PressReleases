Draft Guidelines for issuance and operation of  
Prepaid Payment Instruments in India 
Pre-paid payment instruments issued by banks and non-bank entities have been 
gaining popularity as a means of payment in India. In order to ensure an orderly development 
and operations of this product, Reserve Bank had proactively prepared an 'Approach Paper' 
covering the various issues pertaining to the product. This 'approach paper on pre-paid 
payment instruments' was placed on the RBI website for public comments on November 07, 
2008. The last day for receipt of comments was November 30, 2008. 
Comments were received from banks, existing issuers of pre-paid payment instruments, 
general public and other institutions. A series of meetings were also held with various stake 
holders. Taking into consideration the comments received/ discussions the draft guidelines 
have been prepared and are placed for public comments on our website. 
Comments/suggestions may be e-mailed or faxed to 022-22691557 or addressed to 
Chief General Manager, Reserve Bank of India, Department of Payment and Settlement 
Systems, Central Office, 14th floor, Central Office Building, SBS Marg, Mumbai 400001 latest
