RBI cancels Licence of Ajit Sahakari Bank Limited, Pune 
In view of the fact that Ajit Sahakari Bank Limited, Pune, Maharashtra, had ceased 
to be solvent, all efforts to revive it in close consultation with the Government of 
Maharashtra had failed and the depositors were being inconvenienced by continued 
uncertainty, the Reserve Bank of India delivered the order cancelling its licence, to the bank 
after the close of business on January 28, 2009. The Registrar of Co-operative Societies, 
Maharashtra has also been requested to issue an order for winding up the bank and 
appoint a liquidator for the bank. It may be highlighted that on liquidation, every depositor is 
entitled to repayment of his/her deposits up to a monetary ceiling of Rs.1,00,000/- (Rupees 
One lakh only) from the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) 
under usual terms and conditions.  
The bank was granted a licence by the Reserve Bank on December 6, 1995 to 
commence banking business. The statutory inspection of the bank with respect to its 
position as on March 31, 2007 had indicated that its financial position was impaired. Certain 
operational restrictions were imposed on the bank.      
The latest Statutory Inspection of the bank with reference to its financial position as 
on March 31, 2008 revealed severe deterioration in its financial position.  Accordingly, the 
Reserve Bank of India imposed all inclusive directions under Section 35A of the Banking 
Regulation Act 1949 (As Applicable to Co-operative Societies) with a ceiling of Rs. 1000/- 
on withdrawal of deposits vide directive dated August 18, 2008.  the Reserve Bank of India 
also issued a Requisition dated August 12, 2008 to the Registrar of Co-operative Societies, 
Maharashtra State for supersession of the Board of Directors of the bank under section 110 
A of the Maharashtra Co-operative Societies Act, 1960.  
The bank was served a notice on September 2, 2008, calling on it to show cause as 
to why the licence granted to it under Section 22 of the Banking Regulation Act 1949 (As 
Applicable to Co-operative Societies) on December 6, 1995 to carry on banking business, 
should not be cancelled and why steps should not be taken to wind up the bank. Bankís 
reply to the show cause notice was examined and was found unsatisfactory. The bank also 
did not come out with any concrete plan for revival or any proposal for its merger.  
Considering the sharp deterioration in its financial position as on March 31, 2008 
and the absence of any concrete proposal for merger, there was no possibility of revival of 
the bank. Therefore, the Reserve Bank of India took the extreme measure of cancelling the 
licence of the bank in the interest of the bank's depositors. With cancellation of its licence 
and commencement of liquidation proceedings, the process of paying the depositors of Ajit 
Sahakari Bank Limited, Pune, Maharashtra, will be set in motion subject to the terms and 
conditions of the Deposit Insurance Scheme. 
Consequent to the cancellation of its licence, Ajit Sahakari Bank Limited, Pune, 
Maharashtra, is prohibited from carrying on ëbanking businessí as defined in Section 5(b) of 
the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (As applicable to Co-operative Societies) including 
acceptance and repayment of deposits.

Manager, Urban Banks Department, Mumbai Regional Office, Reserve Bank of India,
