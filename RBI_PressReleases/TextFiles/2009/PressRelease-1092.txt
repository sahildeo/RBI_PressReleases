Reserve Bank Cancels the Licence of Citizen Co-operative Bank Ltd., Burhanpur  
In view of the fact that Citizen Co-operative Bank Ltd., Burhanpur, (M.P), had 
ceased to be solvent, all efforts to revive it in close consultation with the Government of 
Madhya Pradesh had failed and the depositors were being inconvenienced by 
continued uncertainty, the Reserve Bank of India delivered the order cancelling its 
licence to the bank after the close of business on May 27, 2009. The Registrar of Co-
operative Societies, Madhya Pradesh State has also been requested to issue an order 
for winding up the bank and appoint a liquidator for the bank.  It may be highlighted that 
on liquidation, every depositor is entitled to repayment of his/her deposits up to a 
monetary ceiling of Rs. 1,00,000/- (Rupees one lakh only) from the Deposit Insurance 
and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) under usual terms and conditions.  
The bank was granted a licence by Reserve Bank on August 5, 1982 to 
commence banking business.  The statutory inspection of the bank with reference to its 
position as on June 30, 2004 had indicated that its financial position was impaired, and 
it was issued directions under Section 35 A of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (As 
applicable to Co-operative Societies) from the close of business of January 15, 2005 
restricting its operations. Subsequent inspections i.e. March 31, 2007 and March 31, 
2008 also revealed that the bank's financial position deteriorated further. 
The Reserve Bank of India issued a show cause notice to the bank on 
September 19, 2008, asking it to show cause as to why the licence granted to it to 
conduct banking business should not be cancelled. The reply to the show cause notice 
was examined.  The bank did not have a viable plan of action for its revival. In the 
absence of any viable proposal to turn around and achieve the required regulatory 
prescriptions the possibility of revival of the bank was remote. Therefore, the Reserve 
Bank of India took the extreme measure of cancelling licence of the bank in the interest 
of the bank's depositors. With the cancellation of its licence and commencement of 
liquidation proceedings, the process of paying the depositors of Citizen Co-operative 
Bank Ltd., Burhanpur (M.P) will be set in motion subject to the terms and conditions of 
the Deposit Insurance Scheme.   
Consequent to the cancellation of its licence, Citizen Co-operative Bank Ltd., 
Burhanpur (M.P) is prohibited from carrying on ëbanking businessí as defined in Section 
5(b) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (AACS) including acceptance and repayment 
of deposits.

General Manager, Urban Banks Department, Reserve Bank of India, Bhopal.  His
