Directions on Trading of Interest Rate Futures in Recognised  Exchanges 
 
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) today placed on its website the directions 
covering the framework for trading of Interest Rate Futures (IRFs) in recognized 
exchanges, which have been finalized in consultation with the Securities and 
Exchange Board of India (SEBI). The Directions will come into effect immediately. 
 
It may be recalled that the RBI's Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) on 
Money, Foreign Exchange and Government Securities Markets had set up a 
Working Group on Interest Rate Futures (Chairman: Shri V. K. Sharma, Executive 
Director). The Final Report of the TAC was posted on the RBI's website on August 8, 
2008. The Annual Policy Statement for the year 2009-10 (paragraph 93), issued on 
April 21, 2009, had indicated that an exchange-traded IRFs contract on the 10-year 
notional coupon bearing government bond was expected to be launched shortly. The 
RBI-SEBI Standing Technical Committeeís report on operationalisation of the 
recommendations of the TAC Report was posted on the RBI's website on June 17, 
2009.  
 
In this regard, it may be added that Reserve Bank of India, vide its earlier 
circular has permitted banks to take trading positions in Interest Rate Futures. 
However, they cannot undertake trades on behalf of their clients.
