The foreign exchange reserves (including the valuation effects) declined by US$ 
53,755 million during April-December 2008  as against an increase of US$ 76,137 
million during April-December 2007 (Table 2). On a BoP basis (i.e., excluding valuation 
effects), the foreign exchange reserves declined by US$ 20,380 million during April-
December 2008 as against an increase of US$ 67,174 million during April-December 
2007. Valuation loss, reflecting the depreciation of major currencies against the US 
dollar accounted for US$ 33,375 million or 62.1 per cent of the total decline in foreign 
exchange reserves of US$ 53,755 million during April-December 2008 as against a 
valuation gain of US$ 8,963 million during the corresponding period of previous year. 
Apart from current account deficits, outflows under FIIs were the other major sources 
contributing to decline in foreign exchange reserves during April-December 2008.
