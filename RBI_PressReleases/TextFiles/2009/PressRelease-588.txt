Investment by FIIs under PIS :  
M/s Orbit Corporation Limited 
 
 The Reserve Bank of India has today notified that under the Portfolio 
Investment Scheme (PIS), Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) can now purchase 
equity shares and convertible debentures of M/s Orbit Corporation Limited, through 
primary markets and stock exchanges in India. The purchases can be made up to 
100 per cent of the paid up capital of the company, as it has passed a resolution to 
this effect at the Board of Directors' level and at the Extra-Ordinary General Body 
Meeting. The purchases of equity shares by a single FII/Security and Exchange 
Board of India approved sub-account of a registered FII in the above company 
should, however, not exceed 10 per cent (ten per cent) of the paid-up equity capital 
of the companies. 
 
 The revised FII limit of 100 per cent is within the overall 100 per cent FDI limit 
applicable to the company.
