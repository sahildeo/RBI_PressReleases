Reserve Bank Cancels the Licence of Surendranagar Peoples  
Co-operative Bank Ltd., Surendranagar (Gujarat) 
 
In view of the fact that the Surendranagar Peoples Co-operative Bank Ltd., 
Surendranagar had ceased to be solvent, the affairs of the bank were being 
conducted in a manner detrimental to the interests of the depositors and the 
depositors were being inconvenienced by continued uncertainty, the Reserve Bank 
of India delivered the order cancelling its licence to the bank after the close of 
business on September 4, 2009. The Registrar of Co-operative Societies, Gujarat 
has also been requested to issue an order for winding up the bank and appoint a 
liquidator for the bank. It may be highlighted that on liquidation, every depositor is 
entitled to repayment of his/her deposits up to a monetary ceiling of Rs. 1,00,000/- 
(Rupees one lakh only) from the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee 
Corporation (DICGC) under usual terms and conditions.  
 
The bank was granted a licence by Reserve Bank on April 24, 1981 to 
commence banking business. The statutory inspection of the bank with reference to 
its position as on December 31, 2004 had indicated that its financial position was 
impaired and it had violated Reserve Bankís directives and guidelines. Subsequent 
inspections i.e. as on March 31, 2006, 2007 and March 31, 2008 also revealed that 
the bank's financial position deteriorated further.  
 
The Reserve Bank of India issued a show cause notice to the bank on 
January 1, 2009 asking it to show cause as to why the licence granted to it to 
conduct banking business should not be cancelled. The reply to the show cause 
notice was examined but was not found satisfactory. The affairs of the bank were 
being conducted in a manner detrimental to the interests of depositors. Therefore, 
the Reserve Bank of India took the extreme measure of cancelling licence of the 
bank in the interest of the bank's depositors. With the cancellation of its licence and 
commencement of liquidation proceedings, the process of paying the depositors of 
Surendranagar Peoples Co-operative Bank Ltd., Surendranagar Gujarat will be set in 
motion subject to the terms and conditions of the Deposit Insurance Scheme.  
 
Consequent to the cancellation of its licence, Surendranagar Peoples Co-
operative Bank Ltd., Surendranagar, Gujarat is prohibited from carrying on ëbanking 
businessí as defined in Section 5(b) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (AACS) 
including acceptance and repayment of deposits.
