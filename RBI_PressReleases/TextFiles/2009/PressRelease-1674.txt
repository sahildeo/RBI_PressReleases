Reserve Bank Cancels the Licence of Indira Sahakari  Bank Ltd., Dhule,  Maharashtra 
In view of the fact that Indira Sahakari Bank Ltd., Dhule, Maharashtra   had ceased 
to be solvent, all efforts to revive it in close consultation with the Government of 
Maharashtra had failed and the depositors were being inconvenienced by continued 
uncertainty, the Reserve Bank of India delivered the order cancelling its licence to the bank 
after the close of business on February 17, 2009. The Registrar of Co-operative Societies, 
Maharashtra has also been requested to issue an order for winding up the bank and 
appoint a liquidator for the bank.  It may be highlighted that on liquidation, every depositor 
is entitled to repayment of his/her deposits up to a monetary ceiling of Rs. 1,00,000/- 
(Rupees One lakh only) from the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation 
(DICGC) under usual terms and conditions.  
The bank was granted a licence by Reserve Bank on August 17, 1988 to commence 
banking business.  The inspection findings with reference to its financial position as on 
March 31, 2007 revealed deterioration in the bank's financial position. 
The latest inspection of the bank conducted with reference to its financial position as 
on March 31,2008 revealed the precarious financial position of the bank The Reserve Bank 
of India issued directions under Section 35 A of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (As 
applicable to Co-operative Societies) vide Directive dated October 17, 2008. The directions, 
among others, prohibited acceptance of fresh deposits and further lending and restricted 
repayment of deposits up to a maximum of Rs.1000/- per depositor.  
The Reserve Bank of India issued a notice to the bank on October 20, 2008 asking it 
to show cause as to why the licence granted to it to conduct banking business should not 
be cancelled. The reply to the show cause notice was examined and it was observed that 
the bank did not have any viable plan of action for its revival. In the absence of any viable 
proposal for turn around and achieve the required regulatory prescriptions, the possibility of 
revival of the bank was remote. Therefore, the Reserve Bank of India took the extreme 
measure of cancelling licence of the bank in the interest of the bank's depositors. With the 
cancellation of its licence and commencement of liquidation proceedings, the process of 
paying the depositors of Indira Sahakari Bank Ltd., Dhule, Maharashtra will be set in motion 
subject to the terms and conditions of the Deposit Insurance Scheme.   
Consequent to the cancellation of its licence, Indira Sahakari Bank Ltd., Dhule, 
Maharashtra   is prohibited from carrying on ëbanking businessí as defined in Section 5(b) 
of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (AACS) including acceptance and repayment of 
deposits.
