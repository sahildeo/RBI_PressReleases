Reserve Bank Cancels the Licence of 
                          Prantij Nagrik Sahakari Bank Ltd., Prantij (Gujarat) 
In view of the fact that the Prantij Nagrik Sahakari Bank Ltd., Prantij had ceased 
to be solvent, the affairs of the bank were being conducted in a manner detrimental to 
the interests of the depositors and the depositors were being inconvenienced by 
continued uncertainty, the Reserve Bank of India delivered the order cancelling its 
licence to the bank after the close of business on June 30, 2009. The Registrar of Co-
operative Societies, Gujarat has also been requested to issue an order for winding up 
the bank and appoint a liquidator for the bank.  It may be highlighted that on liquidation, 
every depositor is entitled to repayment of his/her deposits up to a monetary ceiling of 
Rs. 1,00,000/- (Rupees one lakh only) from the Deposit Insurance and Credit 
Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) under usual terms and conditions.  
The bank was granted a licence by Reserve Bank on October 15, 1987 to 
commence banking business.  The statutory inspection of the bank with reference to its 
position as on December 31, 2004 had indicated that its financial position was impaired 
and it had violated Reserve Bankís directives and guidelines.  Subsequent inspections 
i.e. as on March 31, 2006 and March 31, 2007 also revealed that the bank's financial 
position deteriorated further and it continued to violate Reserve Bankís Directives and 
guidelines.  
The Reserve Bank of India issued a show cause notice to the bank on February 
5, 2009 asking it to show cause as to why the licence granted to it to conduct banking 
business should not be cancelled. The reply to the show cause notice was examined 
but was not found satisfactory. The affairs of the bank were being conducted in a 
manner detrimental to the interests of depositors. Therefore, the Reserve Bank of India 
took the extreme measure of cancelling licence of the bank in the interest of the bank's 
depositors. With the cancellation of its licence and commencement of liquidation 
proceedings, the process of paying the depositors of Prantij Nagrik Sahakari Bank Ltd., 
Prantij, Gujarat will be set in motion subject to the terms and conditions of the Deposit 
Insurance Scheme.   
Consequent to the cancellation of its licence, Prantij Nagrik Sshakari Bank Ltd., 
Prantij, Gujarat is prohibited from carrying on ëbanking businessí as defined in Section 
5(b) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (AACS) including acceptance and repayment 
of deposits.

General Manager, Urban Banks Department, Reserve Bank of India, Ahmedabad. His
