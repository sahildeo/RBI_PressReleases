RBI provides XBRL enabled filing of Online Returns  
 
The Reserve Bank of India has implemented Online Returns Filing System 
(ORFS) for banks to submit information electronically. Keeping in line with the emerging 
global standards in the area of financial reporting, the Reserve Bank has adopted 
eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) taxonomies for reporting the 
regulatory returns (RCA2) developed as per Basel II guidelines.  
 
In addition to the facility to submit the ORFS/XBRL returns through hyperlinks for 
banks, the ORFS page has also the taxonomies with useful information on the current 
developments in the area of XBRL for banks and other stakeholders. At present, banks 
can file returns in electronic form as well through the Reserve Bank of India's secured 
website and now they will also be able to file the returns through XBRL enabled return 
filing system. The returns can be filed online through a link provided under the 'For 
Bankers' link on the Reserve Bankís website (www.rbi.org.in). From the 'For Bankers' 
link, a new page called "Online Reporting" has been made available. 
 
The Reserve Bank of India is in the process of adopting taxonomies for several 
other returns, including annual and quarterly financial statements.
