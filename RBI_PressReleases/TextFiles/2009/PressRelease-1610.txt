RBI announces Further Monetary Stimulus 
 Since the release of the Reserve Bank's Third Quarter Review on January 
27, 2009, the global financial and economic conditions have further deteriorated 
as revealed by the latest available information. The US real GDP contracted 
sharply at an annualised rate of 6.2 per cent in  the fourth quarter  of 2008 and  
the unemployment rate in the US has moved up to 7.6 per cent. The real GDP in 
the euro area also declined by 1.5 per cent  in the fourth quarter of 2008. 
Reflecting deteriorating global demand, Japanese exports fell by 45.7 per cent 
(y-o-y) in January 2009.  The Japanese economy also contracted sharply by 3.3 
per cent in the fourth quarter of 2008. The fourth quarter real GDP numbers of 
several advanced economies have turned out to be worse than expected. The 
uncertainty, therefore, on global recovery has increased.  
 As a response, the governments all over the world continue to unveil 
expansionary fiscal policies.  Central banks have also taken several measures to 
stimulate demand and moderate the impact of the global downturn and credit 
crunch on their economies. The US Fed and the Bank of Japan have increased 
quantitative and credit easing measures. The UK further reduced its policy rate 
by 50 basis points to 1.0 per cent. Among emerging market economies (EMEs), 
Korea, Indonesia, Thailand, Chile and Mexico reduced their policy rates.  
 Indiaís financial sector continues to be resilient  in the face of global 
financial turmoil. Our financial markets continue to function in an orderly manner. 
Indiaís growth trajectory has, however, been impacted both by the financial crisis 
and the follow-on of global economic downturn. This impact has turned out to be 
deeper and wider than anticipated earlier. Concurrently, because of global 
developments coupled with supply and demand management measures at 
home, WPI inflation is on the decline along the expectations of the Third Quarter 
Review. 
 Reflecting these developments, the aim of various measures initiated by 
the Reserve Bank since mid-September 2008 has been  to augment domestic 
and forex liquidity and to ensure that credit continues to flow to productive 
sectors of the economy. Notably, since mid-September 2008, the Reserve Bank 
has reduced the repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) from 9.0 
per cent to 5.5 per cent, reduced the reverse repo rate under the LAF from 6.0 
per cent to 4.0 per cent, the cash reserve ratio (CRR) from 9.0 per cent to 5.0 per 
 1cent of net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) and the statutory liquidity ratio 
(SLR) from 25.0 per cent  to 24.0 per cent of NDTL. 
  The cumulative amount of actual or potential primary liquidity made 
available to the financial system through various measures initiated by the 
Reserve Bank is over Rs. 3,88,000 crore. Besides, the reduction in SLR by one 
percentage point of NDTL has made available liquid funds of the order of 
Rs.40,000 crore for the purpose of credit expansion. This sizeable easing has 
ensured a comfortable liquidity position. The overnight money market rate has 
remained near or below the lower bound of  the LAF corridor since November 3, 
2008.   
 Consequent to the announcement of fiscal stimulus packages, the market 
borrowing programme of the Central Government  for 2008-09 was raised to 
Rs.3,42,769 crore (gross) and Rs.2,66,539 crore (net) as against the budgeted 
amount of Rs.1,76,453 crore (gross) and Rs.99,000 crore (net).  Against this 
enhanced borrowing programme, market borrowing of the Central Government 
has been Rs.2,66,276 crore (gross) and Rs.1,92,315 crore (net) up to March 3, 
2009.  In terms of the amendment to the Memorandum of Understanding on 
Market Stabilisation Scheme (MSS) on February 26, 2009, an amount of          
Rs. 45,000 crore will be transferred in installments from the MSS cash account to 
the normal cash account of the Government of India by March 31, 2009. An 
equivalent amount of government securities issued under the MSS would now 
form part of the normal market borrowing of the Government of India. This 
arrangement should provide comfort to the market. Furthermore, the Reserve 
Bank has also conducted purchase of government securities under its open 
market operations (OMO). Such operations will be conducted as warranted by 
evolving monetary and financial market conditions.  
 The yield on the 10-year benchmark government securities, which 
hardened from 5.87 per cent on January 23, 2009 to 6.43 per cent on January 
30, 2009, has since softened to 6.04  per cent on March 3, 2009. Taking the 
signal from the reductions in the repo and reverse repo rates in recent months, 
all public sector banks and several private sector and foreign banks have 
reduced their benchmark prime lending rates (BPLRs). Since the announcement 
of the Third Quarter Review, eleven banks have  cut their BPLRs ranging from 25 
basis points to 125 basis points. Several banks have also cut their deposit 
interest rates.   
 The Reserve Bank has been constantly monitoring global developments 
along with the domestic economic situation. On the positive side, inflationary 
pressures have eased significantly. Inflation as measured by year-on-year 
variations in the wholesale  price index (WPI) has declined  to 3.36 per cent  as 
on February 14, 2009, down by about three-fourths from the high of 12.91 per 
cent as on August 2, 2008. However, consumer price inflation, as reflected in 
various consumer price indices, is in the range of 9.85-11.62 per cent as of 
December 2008-January 2009, has yet to show moderation. Consumer price 
inflation has remained at elevated level due to increase in primary articles prices. 
With WPI inflation having moderated significantly, consumer price inflation may 
 2also be expected to decline, though with a lag.  
 At the same time, there is evidence of further slowing down of economic 
activity. Exports registered negative growth for the four recent consecutive 
months, October 2008-January 2009. Overall exports growth during 2008-09 
(April-January) at 13.2 per cent was significantly lower than 24.2 per cent during 
the same period of the last year. The index of industrial production (IIP) 
registered a negative growth of 2.0 per cent during December 2008, with the 
manufacturing sector returning a negative growth of 2.5 per cent. IIP growth 
during April-December 2008 at 3.2 per cent was about one-third of 9.0 per cent 
during the corresponding period of the previous year due to slowdown in all the 
major sectors. Real GDP growth in the third quarter of 2008-09 (September-
December 2008) has been placed at 5.3 per cent by the Central Statistical 
Organisation (CSO). The services sector, which has been the main engine of 
growth during the last several years, has also been slowing down. Business 
confidence has been dented significantly and investment demand has 
decelerated.   
 Non-food bank credit growth reached a peak of 29.4 per cent (Rs.5,82,344 
crore) on a year-on-year basis as on October 10, 2008 as compared with 23.3 
per cent (Rs. 3,74,054 crore) as on October 12, 2007. Subsequently, year-on-
year non-food bank credit growth decelerated to 24.3 per cent as on December 
19, 2008, as credit expansion during the period between October 10, 2008 and 
December 19, 2008 at Rs. 30,889 crore was much lower as compared with Rs. 
1,05,774 crore during the corresponding period of the previous year. According 
to  the latest data, non-food bank credit has decelerated further to 19.7 per cent 
(y-o-y) as on February 13, 2009 as compared with 22.7 per cent as on February 
15, 2008 as credit expansion during the period between December 19, 2008 and 
February 13, 2009 at Rs. 8,091 crore was sharply lower than that of Rs. 86,978 
crore in the corresponding period of the last year. At this level, non-food bank 
credit expansion remains below the indicative projection of 24.0 per cent in the 
Third Quarter Review of the Monetary Policy. The total flow of resources to the 
commercial sector from banks and non-banks during 2008-09 so far (up to 
February 13, 2009) at Rs.4,98,136 crore was lower than Rs.6,08,351 crore 
during the corresponding period of the last year.    
 Even as some public sector and private sector banks have cut lending 
rates in response to the Reserve Bankís monetary policy stance, concerns over 
rising credit risk together with the slowing of economic activity appear to have 
moderated credit growth. The Reserve Bank continues to urge banks to monitor 
their loan portfolio and take early action, to prevent asset impairment down the 
road and safeguard the gains of the last several years in improving asset quality. 
At the same time, banks should price risk appropriately and ensure that 
creditworthy enterprises continue to get funding.   
 On a review of the current global and domestic macroeconomic situation, 
the Reserve Bank has decided to take the following further measures:  
Repo Rate 
 3ï To reduce the repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF)   by  
50 basis points from 5.5 per cent to 5.0 per cent with immediate effect. 
 
Reverse  Repo Rate 
ï To reduce the reverse repo rate under the LAF by 50 basis points  from 
4.0 per cent to 3.5 per cent with immediate effect.  
 
 
 It is expected that the reduction in the policy interest rates will further  
encourage  banks to provide credit for productive purposes at viable interest 
rates. The Reserve Bank on its part would continue to maintain ample liquidity  in 
the system.
