DRG Study on ìMonetary Policy, Forex Markets and Feedback 
under Uncertainty in An Open Economyî 
 
The Reserve Bank of India released a DRG Study entitled, ìMonetary Policy, 
Forex Markets and Feedback under Uncertainty in An Open Economyî. The Study is 
co-authored by Prof. Ashima Goyal, Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research 
along with staff members from the Reserve Bank (Shri Ayyappan Nair, Assistant 
General Manager, Financial Markets Department and Dr. Amaresh Samantaraya, 
Assistant Adviser, Department of Banking Supervision). 
  
 The Study attempted to examine options for monetary policy arising from its 
intervention in Indian foreign exchange markets. Beginning with a brief survey of 
current microstructure of foreign exchange markets in India and its monetary policy 
institutions, the study brings out policy trilemmas in dealing with large cross border 
flows in a rapidly growing emerging market, where fundamentals are uncertain. Major 
findings of the study are as follows: 
 
ï Intervention affects both the level of the exchange rate and its volatility ñ 
supporting intervention as an additional policy tool.  
ï Among microstructure variables, merchant net demand or order flows affect the 
level of exchange rate, while dealer order flow and turnover variables affect 
volatility.  
ï Although intervention increases turnover, anticipated intervention decreases it, 
suggesting it is optimal to reveal information about future intervention. 
Expectations of future exchange rates and intervention are stabilising and not 
perverse. 
ï Estimated strategic market behaviour and model derivations both indicate 
intervention and signaling may be a more effective influence on exchange rates 
in the Indian context than interest rate changes. 
ï Markets form expectations of intervention activity and respond strategically to it. 
The increase in dealer turnover with intervention may imply strategic intraday 
arbitrage, whereby dealers profit at the expense of merchants and the central 
bank.
