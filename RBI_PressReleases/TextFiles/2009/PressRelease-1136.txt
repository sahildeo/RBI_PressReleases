Negotiated Dealing System ñ Changes in the operational process  
relating to auction of the Government of India securities 
 
The Reserve Bank of India, in consultation with the Government of India, has 
decided to make the following changes in the manner in which bids are submitted in 
the auctions of the Government of India securities so as to improve the efficiency of 
the auction procedure, particularly early announcement of the results of the auction 
by 2:30 P.M. 
1.  Dated securities 
a. Competitive Bids 
All competitive bids shall be submitted electronically on the Negotiated 
Dealing System (NDS). Persons, other than NDS members, shall route their 
competitive bids through an NDS member. Competitive bids may be 
submitted between 10:30 A.M. and 12:30 P.M. on the day of the auction, as 
hitherto. 
b. Non-competitive bids 
Retail and eligible institutional investors, desirous of participating in the 
auction under the Non-competitive Bidding Scheme, would be required to 
maintain a gilt account with a bank or a Primary Dealer. Under the Scheme, 
an investor can submit a single bid only in an auction of a dated security 
through a bank or a Primary Dealer. Non-competitive bids may be submitted 
electronically on the NDS between 10:30 A.M. and 11:30 A.M. No bids under 
the Non-competitive Bidding scheme shall be accepted after 11:30 A.M.  
c.  Bids in physical format 
No bids, either competitive or non-competitive shall, henceforth, be accepted 
in physical format in the auctions of Government of India dated securities, 
except in extraordinary situations as may be specified by the Reserve Bank of 
India.  
2. Treasury Bills 
a. Competitive Bids 
Competitive bids in Treasury Bill auctions shall be submitted electronically 
between 10:30 A.M. and 12:30 P.M., as hitherto, but no physical bids would 
be accepted, except in extraordinary situations as may be specified by the 
Reserve Bank of India.

b. Non-competitive Bids 
Investors, eligible to bid under the Non-competitive Bidding Scheme for 
Treasury Bills, may continue to tender physical bids, till further notice. Such 
non-competitive bids may be submitted by 11:30 A.M.  
The above changes shall be operational with immediate effect. 
It may be recalled that the Annual Policy Statement for the year 2008-09 had 
announced the setting up of an Internal Working Group (Chairman: Shri H.R.Khan) 
to review the extant auction procedure and make suggestions to reduce the time 
taken for completion of the auction process with a view to improving the overall 
efficiency in the primary market auctions of the Government securities on par with 
the best international practices. The Annual Policy Statement for the year 2009-10 
had announced that some the recommendations made by the Working Group would 
be implemented shortly. The above changes in the auction procedure are in line with 
the recommendations of the Working Group.
