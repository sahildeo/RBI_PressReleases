Reserve Bank of India releases Winter 2008 Issue of its Occasional Papers 
 
The Reserve Bank of India today released the winter 2008 issue of its 
Reserve Bank of India Occasional Papers. This is a research journal of the Reserve 
Bank and contains contributions of the Bank's staff and reflects the views of the 
authors. It contains articles, special notes and book reviews on issues ranging from 
the relevance of government deficit for stabilisation, banking penetration for financial 
inclusion, imported inflation and its implications and efficiency in auction of 
Government securities, which are some of the important areas of policy concerns. 
 
           The first paper titled ‘Is the Government Deficit in India Still Relevant for 
Stabilisation?’ by Jeevan K. Khundrakpam and Rajan Goyal revisits the causal 
relationships between government deficit and money, and the latter with real output 
and prices in India for the period 1951-52 to 2006-07 by employing the ARDL 
approach to cointegration analysis. The paper finds evidence of government deficit 
leading to reserve money creation with consequent increase in money supply. This 
could take place through government deficit leading to incomplete sterilisation of net 
foreign assets (NFA) accumulation with the intention to enable adequate market 
subscription to Government borrowings, replacing the erstwhile channel of net RBI 
credit to the Government. The paper finds that while price is caused by money and 
real output both in the short as well as in the long-run, money is neutral to output. 
The paper concludes that government deficit continues to remain relevant for 
stabilisation since it leads to money creation which in turn has inflationary 
implications. 
 
          In the second paper ‘Auctions of Government Securities in India – An Analysis’ 
by Ravi Shankar and Sanjoy Bose, the various performance parameters associated 
with auctions of Government of India dated securities are evaluated in view of the 
increasing importance of auction methodology and its practical use in a market 
oriented mechanism from 1990s onwards. The paper observes that G-Sec auctions 
in India are fairly efficient as bidding dispersion is quite low with normality in pricing 
behaviour. The bidding behaviour analysis of Indian government securities auctions 
shows that bidders’ pricing strategy is negatively influenced by bid size, bid cover 
ratio and tenor of the security. To minimize the ‘winners-curse’ in the auctions, 
bidders are reducing their bid amount for higher priced bids. The statistical analysis 
in the paper also validates various standard auction features and also establishes 
that the auctions help in determining most commonly perceived market-clearing 
borrowing rates out of well behaved bid-price distributions.  2
           Under the section on Special Notes, a paper ‘Imported Inflation: the Evidence 
from India’ by Janak Raj, Sarat Dhal and Rajeev Jain analyses the sources and 
commodity-wise trends in imported inflation in India during the last four decades. At 
the global level, the paper finds that export of inflation from oil exporting countries is 
significantly higher than that of industrial and non-oil developing countries, and 
among the latter two the export of inflation from the former is higher. The paper finds 
that domestic inflation in India is positively influenced by import price, capital flows 
and exchange rate. The paper indicates the need to strengthen absorptive capacity 
of capital flows in the domestic economy in future through efficient allocation of 
capital, which otherwise could have some stabilizing impact on domestic inflation 
through exchange rate appreciation and resultant reduced import prices, and may 
lead to asset bubbles and overheating of the economy. Lack of the absorptive 
capacity raises doubts not only regarding the potential gains to the domestic 
economy from the globalization but also the overall institutional and policy 
environment of the country. 
 
           The second paper in this section, titled ‘Bank Penetration and SHG-Bank 
Linkage Programme: A Critique’ by Pankaj Kumar and Ramesh Golait examines the 
outreach of SHG-Bank Linkage Programme (SBLP) in the backdrop of growing 
banking and socio-economic divide between regions in India. The paper finds that 
nationalisation of major commercial banks and the remarkable spread of the banking 
system to the unbanked and under-banked rural areas that followed has not reduced 
the dependence on informal sources of credit in rural areas. The distribution of 
SBLP, which was conceived to fill the existing gap in the formal financial network and 
extending the outreach of banking to the poor, is skewed against the poorer Eastern 
and Central Regions of the country. The paper provide several suggestions 
including: the need for encouraging banks to become facilitators in extending the 
SHG movement in the poorer regions by introducing performance-linked incentive; 
creation of specific funds to address the regional imbalances in the SBLP; formation 
of SHGs around activities of rural infrastructure such as construction and renovation 
of minor irrigation tanks, feeder channels, rural roads, etc., which can generate 
significant external economies for agricultural yields and overall rural development; 
and efforts to embed livelihood activities, micro-insurance and grain banks in the 
SHG model.
