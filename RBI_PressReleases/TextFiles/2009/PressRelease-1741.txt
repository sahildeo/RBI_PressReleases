RBI Board meets Today at Ahmedabad 
The Central Board of the Reserve Bank of India met today at Ahmedabad.  
The meeting reviewed key economic, monetary and financial developments and the 
various steps taken since mid-December 2008 to preserve financial stability and 
arrest the moderation in the growth momentum in the context of the ongoing global 
financial crisis and the deepening recession in major economies of the world. 
 Prior to the meeting of the Central Board, the Reserve Bank Governor had a 
one-on-one meeting with the Honíble Chief Minister of Gujarat followed by a meeting 
on February 11, 2009 in Ahmedabad with the Honíble Minister of Finance of Gujarat 
Government, senior officials of the State Government, commercial banks and 
financial institutions represented in Gujarat, to discuss the State-specific issues 
relating to banking.  Pursuant to the deliberations at the meeting, the following 
decisions were taken:  
a) Financial Inclusion: The State Level Bankersí Committee (SLBC) will review 
the status of financial inclusion in Gujarat and fix quantifiable targets, within a 
period of one month, for enhancing the extent and quality of financial inclusion 
in the State. The review will, in particular, explore how the quality and pace of 
financial inclusion can synergise with the proposal of the Government of 
Gujarat to cover all the villages in the state with broad band connectivity.       
  
b) Restructuring: The State Government will meet the bankers and the various 
borrower segments to encourage them to take the maximum advantage of the 
guidelines issued by the Reserve Bank in regard to the restructuring of bank 
dues of the borrowers. Any regulatory issues relating to the operationalisation 
of these guidelines could be taken up with the Reserve Bank.  
 
 It may be recalled in this context that as part of the countercyclical 
measures, the Reserve Bank has extended the time limit for initiating the 
restructuring of the stressed borrowal accounts by the banks till March 31, 
2009 and the eligible restructured accounts would attract special regulatory 
treatment provided the restructuring is implemented by June 2009.   
 
c) Task Force for Diamond Sector : A Task Force will be constituted, 
consisting of the representatives of the State Government, the SLBC 
Convener and other bankers, to look into distress arising on account of 
problems faced by diamond industry in Gujarat and to make practicable 
recommendations for mitigating the difficulties. The Reserve Bank will be the 
convener of the Task Force which will submit its report not later than February 
28, 2009.    
The Reserve Bank will continue to closely monitor the developments in 
the global and domestic financial markets and will take swift and effective  2
action, as appropriate. The Reserve Bank will endeavour to minimise the 
stress on various sectors of the economy on account of the international 
financial crisis and the global slowdown.  The policy objective is to ensure 
adequate availability of liquidity in the system and to maintain conditions 
conducive for flow of credit for all productive purposes, particularly to housing, 
export and small and medium industry sectors.  
The following members were present in the meeting of the Central 
Board: Prof U R Rao, Shri Lakshmi Chand, Shri H P Ranina, Dr Ashok 
Ganguly, Shri Suresh Neotia, Dr A Vaidyanathan, Prof M M Sharma, Shri 
Sanjay Labroo and Shri Ashok Chawla, Secretary (Economic Affairs), Ministry 
of Finance, Government of India. Dr. D. Subbarao, Governor, Reserve Bank 
of India chaired the meeting. Deputy Governors of the Reserve Bank, Smt 
Shyamala Gopinath, and Smt Usha Thorat were also present.  
The Central Board of Directors of the Reserve Bank meets at least 
once every quarter. The Board has scheduled meetings in Mumbai, Chennai 
and Kolkata each year. The post-budget meeting of the Board, traditionally 
held in New Delhi, is addressed by the Union Finance Minister. The other 
meetings of the Board are held in the remaining state capitals by rotation. The 
main function of the Central Board of the Reserve Bank is to provide overall 
direction to its affairs.
