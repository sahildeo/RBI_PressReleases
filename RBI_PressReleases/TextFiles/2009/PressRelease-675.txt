 Keeping in view both international and domestic initiatives for resolving the 
current crisis and strengthening the international financial architecture,  the Annual

 Accordingly, a new Financial Stability Unit (FSU) has been constituted in the 
Reserve Bank on July 17, 2009. The main functions of the FSU would include: -

ongoing basis.

stability, in co-ordination with the supervisory wings of the Reserve Bank.
