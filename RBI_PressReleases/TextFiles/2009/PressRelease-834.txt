RBI to Continue with Purchases of  
Government Securities under OMO Programme 
 
Banking system liquidity has been comfortable during the current fiscal year 
so far with the daily absorption under the reverse repo window of LAF exceeding 
Rs.1,00,000 crore on almost all days. Going forward, the Reserve Bank on its part 
would continue to maintain ample liquidity in the system. In this context, the open 
market operations (OMO) purchase programme (announced on March 26, 2009) 
would also be continued over the remaining period of the first half of the current 
fiscal year (April ñ September 2009) with auctions conducted every alternate week 
as hitherto.  
 
It may be recalled that on March 26, 2009, the Reserve Bank had announced 
its intention to purchase an indicative amount of Rs. 80,000 crore under its open 
market operations during the first half (April-September) of 2009-10. It is reiterated 
that the Reserve Bank will have the flexibility to make changes in the amount of 
OMO and alter frequency and day of auction as may be necessary.  
 
During the current fiscal year so far, the Reserve Bank of India has purchased 
Government securities amounting to Rs. 29,850 crore through OMO auctions as 
against the aggregate notified amount of Rs. 43,500 crore. Over the same period, 
MSS unwinding has been of the order of Rs.65,500 crore (comprising Rs.37,500 
crore of redemption and Rs.28,000 crore of de-sequestering). MSS redemptions of 
Rs.4,500 crore are due in the remaining part of the first half of the current fiscal year.
