GR Forms now available on-line 
The Reserve Bank of India has today placed on its website www.rbi.org.in the 
on-line printing of GR forms to facilitate submission of information by the exporter 
community.  
The Foreign Exchange Management Act requires exporters to complete GR 
forms and submit them in duplicate to the specified authority for exports, including 
export of software in physical form, i.e., magnetic tapes/discs and paper media but 
not for exports done through post. At present, exporters are required to purchase the 
GR forms from the Regional Offices of the Reserve Bank at a cost of one rupee.  
Exporters can now print the GR form on-line and submit it to the specified 
authority. The GR number will be automatically allotted while printing the form.   
The present facility of purchasing of GR forms from the Reserve Bank will be 
phased out within a period of one year after consultation with trade bodies.
