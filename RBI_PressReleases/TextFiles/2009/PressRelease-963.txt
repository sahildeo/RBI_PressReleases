Investment by FIIs under PIS : Bajaj Auto Ltd.  
The Reserve Bank of India has today notified that consequent to the approval 
for demerging of Bajaj Auto Ltd. with Bajaj Finserv Ltd. and Bajaj Holdings and 
Investment Ltd. with effect from June 16, 2009 the FII holding has gone below 24 per 
cent. Hence, the restriction placed on the purchase of shares of Bajaj Auto Ltd. on 
behalf of FIIs may be treated as withdrawn. It will, therefore, now be in order to 
purchase the shares of the company in the secondary market on behalf of FII clients 
who have obtained permission to invest under the Portfolio Investment Scheme 
(PIS) subject to the existing ceilings and guidelines in this regard.
