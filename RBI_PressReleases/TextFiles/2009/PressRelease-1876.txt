RBI's Special Fixed Rate Term Repo Auction for Rs. 59,080 Crore Today 
The Reserve Bank of India shall conduct a special fixed rate term repo at 5.5 per cent 
per annum against eligible securities for Rs.59,080 crore on January 27, 2009, due for reversal 
on February 10, 2009, with a view to enabling banks to meet the liquidity requirements of 
Mutual Funds (MFs), Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) and Housing Finance 
Companies (HFCs) either on incremental or on rollover basis. The outstanding amount under 
this facility as on January 23, 2009 stood at Rs.920 crore. 
 
It may be recalled that the Reserve Bank of India had announced earlier that it would 
conduct the special fixed rate term repo under Liquidity Adjustment Facility daily till June 30, 
2009 up to a cumulative amount of Rs.60,000 crore on outstanding basis and that additional 
liquidity support to the extent of up to 1.5 per cent of their NDTL, can be availed by banks 
exclusively for the purpose of meeting requirements of MFs, NBFCs and HFCs. It has now 
been decided to extend this facility up to September 30, 2009.
