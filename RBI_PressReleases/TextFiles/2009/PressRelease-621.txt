Roadmap for Access to Banking Facility in Every Village by 2011:  
RBI High Level Committee suggests 
A High Level Committee set up by the Reserve Bank of India has 
recommended that a sub-committee of the District Consultative Committee may 
draw up a roadmap to provide banking services in any form to every village with a 
population of over 2000 at least once a week on regular basis by March 2011 and in 
States where banking penetration is better, the date may be suitably advanced. It 
has also suggested that the Lead District Manager may convene a quarterly public 
meeting at various locations in the district where the Reserve Bank, banks having 
presence in the area and other stakeholders are present to generate awareness of 
the various banking policies and regulations relating to the common person, obtain 
feedback from the public and provide grievance redressal to the extent possible at 
such meeting or facilitate approaching the appropriate machinery for such redressal. 
The High Level Committee was set up by the Reserve Bank to improve the 
effectiveness of the Lead Bank Scheme with a focus on financial inclusion and 
recent developments in the banking sector.  The High Level Committee on Lead 
Bank Scheme (Chairperson: Smt. Usha Thorat), on August 20, 2009, submitted its 
final report to the Governor, Reserve Bank of India. Chief Secretaries of select 
States, Chairmen of major public sector banks and others were members on the 
High Level Committee.  
Other major recommendations of the Committee include:  
Roadmap for Financial Inclusion: A Sub-Committee of the District Consultative 
Committee (DCC) may draw up a road map to provide services through a banking 
outlet (in any form, such as, brick and mortar branch, mobile banking, extension 
counters, satellite offices or Business Correspondents) at every village with a 
population of over 2000 at least once a week on a regular basis. By March 2010, the 
Sub-Committee should come out with a time frame within which this can be achieved 
and the time frame to cover all villages having population of more than 2000 with a 
banking outlet should not be later than March 2011. In States where the banking 
penetration is better, the date may be suitably advanced. 
Role of State Governments: State Governments should ensure road and digital 
connectivity to all centres where penetration by the formal banking system is 
required, expedite use of IT solutions for disbursal of National Rural Employment 
Guarantee Act (NREGA) and social security payments and extend support to banks 
in the recovery of their dues.

Preparation of State Level/District Level Plan: A one-time comprehensive State 
Level/District Level Development Plan should be formulated for all the districts that 
should identify the enablers and impeders for banking  development and indicate the 
specific actions to be taken by banks, State Governments and other stakeholders to 
ensure banking development for inclusive growth.  
Strengthening SLBC and DCC Machinery: The Chief Secretary of the State 
concerned may co-chair the meetings of the State Level Bankers' Committee 
(SLBC), along with the CMD of the convenor bank. The Chief Minister/ Finance 
Minister may be invited to attend and chair the meetings periodically, say at least 
once a year, when there are major policy issues on the agenda.  The Deputy 
Governor/Executive Director of the Reserve Bank may participate in the SLBC 
meetings on a selective basis. In view of the large membership of the SLBC, it is 
desirable for the SLBC to constitute sub committees for specific tasks. At the District 
Consultative Committee (DCC) level, sub committees as appropriate may be set up 
to work intensively on specific issues and submit reports to the DCC for its 
consideration.  
Role and Set-up of LDMís Office: The Committee recommended strengthening of 
the office of Lead District Managers (LDMs), posting persons of appropriate level 
and attitude as also providing appropriate infrastructural support, it being the focal 
point for successful implementation of the Lead Bank Scheme.  
Financial Literacy and Credit Counselling: Each Lead Bank should open a 
Financial Literacy and Credit Counselling centre in each district by following the 
recent guidelines issued by the Reserve Bank.  
Quarterly Public Meeting at District Level for Awareness and Feedback: The 
Lead District Manager may convene a quarterly public meeting at various locations 
in the district where the Reserve Bank, banks having presence in the area and other 
stakeholders are present to generate awareness of the various banking policies and 
regulations relating to the common person, obtain feedback from the public and 
provide grievance redressal to the extent possible at such meeting or facilitate 
approaching the appropriate machinery for such redressal.  
Initiative for Urban Areas: Banks having the largest presence in each city with 
more than one million population (to start with) may take the leadership in convening 
a meeting of bankers and allocating responsibility for various wards to different 
banks, to ensure that all urban households have easier access to banking services. 
Greater Role for Private Sector Banks: Private sector banks should involve 
themselves more actively by bringing in their expertise in strategic planning and 
leveraging on information technology. The Lead Banks, on their part, should also 
ensure that private sector banks are more closely involved in the Lead Bank 
Scheme, both while drawing up and in implementing the Annual Credit Plans. 
Revised PSMIS reporting system: The Committee suggested implementation of 
revised Priority Sector Monitoring and Information System (PSMIS) on a pilot basis 
in one/two States initially and thereafter extending to the rest of the country with 
effect from April 1, 2010. The Committee has also suggested constitution of a small 
Working Group by the Reserve Bank of India to formulate the modalities and work on 
implementation of the revised framework. 3 
Background  
The Reserve Bank of India had, in 1969, introduced the Lead Bank Scheme. 
Subsequently, several changes took place in the country, especially after 1991 with 
the beginning of globalisation and liberalisation of the Indian economy. The reforms 
encompassed all sectors including the financial sector. While policies were in place 
to facilitate flow of credit to the more vulnerable sectors/sections of society, a need 
was felt to ensure greater dissemination and implementation of these policies at the 
grass root level, besides getting timely information and better assessment of 
outcomes.  
Subsequent to the announcement in the Mid-term Review of the Annual 
Policy Statement for 2007-08, a High Level Committee (Chairperson: Smt. Usha 
Thorat) was constituted to review the Lead Bank Scheme and improve its 
effectiveness, with a focus on financial inclusion and recent developments in the 
banking sector. Chief Secretaries of select States, Chairmen of major public sector 
banks and others were members on the High Level Committee. The Committee 
submitted its draft report on May 21, 2009 which was placed on the RBI website for 
public comments. Based on the feedback/comments/suggestions received from the 
public, banks and institutions, the Committee has now finalised the report.   
The full text of the Report of the High Level Committee to Review Lead Bank 
Scheme is available on the RBI website.
