Reserve Bank cancels the Licence of The Surat Mahila Nagrik  
Sahakari Bank Ltd., Surat (Gujarat) 
In view of the fact that The Surat Mahila Nagrik Sahakari Bank Ltd., Surat had 
ceased to be solvent, the affairs of the bank were being conducted in a manner 
detrimental to the interests of the depositors and the depositors were being 
inconvenienced by continued uncertainty, the Reserve Bank of India delivered the 
order cancelling its licence to the bank after the close of business on October 
20,2009. The Registrar of Co-operative Societies, Gujarat has also been requested 
to issue an order for winding up the bank and appoint a liquidator for the bank. It may 
be highlighted that on liquidation, every depositor is entitled to repayment of his/her 
deposits up to a monetary ceiling of Rs.1,00,000/- (Rupees one lakh only) from the 
Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) under usual items 
and conditions. 
The bank was granted a license by Reserve Bank on May 28, 1996 to 
commence banking business. The statutory inspection of the bank with reference to 
the position as on March 31, 2008 had indicated that its financial position was 
impaired. Subsequent inspection i.e. as on March 31, 2009 revealed that the bankís 
financial position deteriorated further. 
The Reserve Bank of India issued a show cause notice to the bank on July 
21, 2009 asking it to show cause as to why the licence granted to it to conduct 
banking business should not be cancelled. The reply to the show cause notice was 
examined but was not found satisfactory. The affairs of the bank were being 
conducted in a manner detrimental to the interests of the depositors. Therefore, the 
Reserve Bank of India took the extreme measure of cancelling licence of the bank in 
the interest of the bankís depositors. With the cancellation of its licence and 
commencement of liquidation proceedings, the process of paying the depositors of 
The Surat Mahila Nagrik Sahakari Bank Ltd., Surat, Gujarat will be set in motion 
subject to the terms and conditions of the Deposit Insurance Scheme.  
Consequent to the cancellation of its licence, The Surat Mahila Nagrik 
Sahakari Bank Ltd,Surat ,Gujarat is prohibited from carrying on ëbanking businessí 
as defined in Section 5 (b) of the Banking Regulation Act,1949 (AACS) including 
acceptance and repayment of deposits.
