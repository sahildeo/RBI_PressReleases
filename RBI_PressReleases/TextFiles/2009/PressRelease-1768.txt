Government of Orissa signs MoU 
with Reserve Bank of India 
The Government of Orissa and the Reserve Bank of India have, on February 
9, 2009, signed a Memorandum of Understanding with regard to Urban Co-operative 
Banks in the State of Orissa.  Consequent upon this, a State level Task Force for 
Urban Co-operative Banks (TAFCUB) has been constituted for Orissa.  Shri Kaza 
Sudhakar, Regional Director for Orissa, Reserve Bank of India, is the Chairman of 
the TAFCUB and Shri K.C.Mohanty, Registrar of Cooperative Societies, Government 
of Orissa is its Co-Chairman.  The other members of the TAFCUB include a 
representative each from State and National Federation of Urban Cooperative 
Banks, a nominee of State Government of Orissa and a representative of Urban 
Banks Department, Reserve Bank of India, Central Office, Mumbai. The first meeting 
of the TAFCUB will be held shortly. 
Similar MoUs have also been signed with the Governments of the States of 
Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand, 
Chattisgarh, Goa, Maharashtra, Assam, NCT of Delhi, Haryana, West Bengal, 
Tripura, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Himachal Pradesh, Kerala, 
Mizoram, Tamil Nadu, Sikkim and Union Territory of Puducherry. Thus, 1760 UCBs 
are covered under MOU, i.e. 99.5% of total number of UCBs accounting for 99.8% of 
deposits of the sector. 
As part of its developmental role, the Reserve Bank would also be assessing 
the training, computerization needs of the Urban Co-operative Banks in the State of 
Orissa with the objective of upgrading their human resources skills and technological 
infrastructure so that they improve their operational efficiency and quality of 
management information systems. 
It may be recalled that in the Mid-Term Review of Annual Policy announced in 
October 2004, the Reserve Bank had announced that a vision document for Urban 
Co-operative Banks would be prepared.  Accordingly, the Reserve Bank placed in 
public domain a draft vision document in March 2005. As the Urban Co-operative 
Banks are subject to dual control by the Reserve Bank and the State Governments, 
the vision document envisaged the signing of MoU between State Governments and 
the Reserve Bank of India to put in place an arrangement through which there is a 
convergence on the approach and remedial actions required to be taken for 
facilitating the development of the sector.  The vision document also proposed the 
constitution of a State Level Task Force for Urban Co-operative Banks with 
representatives of State Government, State/National Federation of Urban 
Cooperative Banks and the Reserve Bank of India as its members, for the purpose 
of identifying the potentially viable Urban Cooperative Banks and drawing up a time-
bound action plan for their revival by setting specific monitorable milestones.
