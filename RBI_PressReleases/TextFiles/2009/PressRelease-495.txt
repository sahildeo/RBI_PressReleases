Restrictive practices while accepting bank notes 
It has come to the notice of the Reserve Bank of India that certain 
establishments are adopting restrictive practices such as not accepting notes of 
certain denominations or series etc. The Reserve Bank of India, therefore considers 
it necessary to emphasise that all government/semi-government offices, public/ 
private sector institutions and also any other organisation/establishment/ individual 
accepting cash should desist from such practices.  
For further information and guidance, the Regional Offices of the Reserve 
Bank of India may be approached. Features of genuine Indian bank notes are also 
posted on Reserve Bank of Indiaís web site www.rbi.org.in.
