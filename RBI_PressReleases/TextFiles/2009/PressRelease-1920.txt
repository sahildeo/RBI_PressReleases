The terms of reference of the Committee are: (i) to review and recommend measures for deepening and widening the money, 
foreign exchange and government securities markets including those relating to 
participants, products, institutional and infrastructural arrangements etc.; 
(ii) to suggest measures for development of market and promoting liquidity in money 
market instruments, foreign exchange market and government securities;

foreign exchange and government securities and capital markets; 
(iv) to review the infrastructure, legal and institutional arrangements for trading, 
transfer and settlement in the money, foreign exchange and government 
securities markets;  
(v) to prepare and consider papers on topics relating to product/market development 
and advise on the policies and practices for the same;

 The Committee may appoint Technical Groups consisting of its own members and/or

Committee will meet as often as it is required, but at least once in a quarter and will function for

It may be recalled that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had first constituted the 
Technical Advisory Committee on Money and Government Securities Markets on July 12, 1999 
for a tenure of two years. So far, the TAC has been reconstituted thrice viz., in September 
2001, in February 2004 and in June 2006. Keeping in view the inter-linkages between Money, 
Foreign Exchange and Government Securities Markets and implications for monetary policy 
operations, the ambit of the TAC was widened, at the time of its reconstitution in February 
2004, to include the foreign exchange markets. The TAC is now being reconstituted so that the 
Reserve Bank can continue obtaining the benefit of opinion from financial market experts from 
areas such as, banking, academics, government, stock exchanges, credit rating agencies and 
market representatives. The confluence of ideas and the advice brought about by this wide 
representation has enabled the Reserve Bank to make further reforms in financial markets, 
including products, practices, institutional arrangements and regulation in these markets.
