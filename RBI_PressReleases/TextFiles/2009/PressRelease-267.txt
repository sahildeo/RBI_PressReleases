RBI purchases Gold under IMFís Limited Gold Sales Programme 
 
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has concluded the purchase of 200 metric tonnes of gold from the 
International Monetary Fund (IMF), under the IMFís limited gold sales programme. This was done as 
part of the Reserve Bankís foreign exchange reserves management operations. The purchase was an 
official sector off-market transaction and was executed over a two week period during October 19-30, 
2009 at market based prices.  
It may be recalled that the Executive Board of the IMF, on September 18, 2009 announced  its 
decision to sell 403.3 metric tonnes (or 12,965,649 fine troy ounces) of gold as a central element of its 
New Income Model and in order to increase its resources for lending to low-income countries. The IMF 
also decided that the initial offer of the sale of the gold would be directly to official holders, including 
central banks.
