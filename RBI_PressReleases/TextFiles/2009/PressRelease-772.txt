Macroeconomic and Monetary Developments: First Quarter Review 2009-10 
The Reserve Bank of India today released the document ìMacroeconomic and 
Monetary Developments: First Quarter Review 2009-10î which serves as a background to 
the First Quarter Review of Monetary Policy 2009-10 being announced on July 28, 2009. 
The highlights of macroeconomic and monetary developments are the following: 
Global Economic Conditions  
ï The global economic environment continues to remain uncertain, although the rate 
of contraction in economic activities and the extent of pressures on financial 
systems eased in the first quarter of 2009-10. Nascent and sporadic signs of 
improvements in the global conditions do not suggest any clear trend, and as a 
result, the uncertainty on the timing and pace of global recovery persists. 
ï Signs of improvements in the global financial conditions observed in the first quarter 
of 2009-10 are necessary, but not sufficient, to induce a firm global recovery, 
particularly in view of the depressed demand conditions.  
ï According to the current available assessment of the IMF, the global economy is 
projected to contract by 1.4 per cent in 2009 and to expand by 2.5 per cent in 2010. 
The growth outlook of India and China for 2009, however, has been revised 
upwards by the IMF.  
Output 
ï Reflecting the contagion from the synchronised global recession, domestic growth 
impulses remained subdued in India, which was evident from the growth 
deceleration in the second half of 2008-09. At 6.7 per cent, GDP growth for 2008-09, 
however, was better than what most had expected, though it reflected a deceleration 
in relation to the average 8.8 per cent rate recorded during the high growth phase of 
2003-04 to 2007-08.  
ï The overall GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 2008-09 remained at the same level 
as in the previous quarter, primarily on account of a turnaround in growth in 
agriculture and allied activities, even as industry and services continued to exhibit 
sustained deceleration over the four successive quarters of the year, with the rate of 
deceleration rising in the second half reflecting the contagion from the global 
synchronised recession. 
Agriculture, Industry and Services 
ï The fourth Advance Estimates place the total food grain production during 2008-09 
at a record 233.9 million tonnes.  
ï The slow progress of monsoon up to end-June 2009 has affected the kharif sowing, 
which could have implications for the agricultural production. The rainfall in July so 
far, however, has improved enabling better sowing position as on July 17, 2009 for 
pulses, oilseeds and coarse cereals at close to last yearís levels, though paddy 
sowing still remains substantially below last yearís level. During 2008-09, the lower 
Kharif output was made good by the Rabi output and, as a result, the overall 
agricultural production exhibited a turnaround in the fourth quarter of the year.  2
ï The core infrastructure sector grew by 4.8 per cent during the first quarter of 2009-
10 as compared with 3.5 per cent growth during the corresponding quarter of the 
previous year, led by growth in electricity, cement and coal. The cement sector 
recorded acceleration, indicating revival of construction activity. 
ï The Index of Industrial Production (IIP), which had registered a significant 
deceleration in growth to 0.1 per cent in the last quarter of 2008-09, exhibited growth 
at 1.9 per cent during April-May 2009, even though that reflected deceleration in 
relation to 5.3 per cent growth recorded during April-May 2008. Out of the 17 two-
digit manufacturing industry groups, however, 10 groups recorded positive growth 
during April-May 2009-10 as compared to 11 industry groups recording positive 
growth in the corresponding period of last year. 
ï The lead indicators of services sector activity such as railway freight and new cell 
phone connections showed positive signs. Tourist arrivals also improved in June 
2009. Production of commercial vehicles, cargo handled at major ports, and 
passengers handled at domestic and international terminals, however, exhibited 
deceleration during the first two months of 2009-10. 
Aggregate Demand 
ï Weakening aggregate demand emerged as a major constraint to growth in 2008-09. 
The significant deceleration in private consumption expenditure as well as the 
moderation in investment demand required expansionary fiscal policy to arrest the 
slowdown in growth. Government consumption expenditure, therefore, increased 
sharply in the third and fourth quarters and contributed 32.5 per cent of real GDP 
growth (at market prices) in 2008-09, as against an average contribution of 5.9 per 
cent in the previous five years. 
ï Reflecting the fiscal response to the growth slowdown, key deficit indicators of the 
Central Government, viz., the revenue deficit and the gross fiscal deficit in the 
revised estimates for 2008-09 were significantly higher than the budgeted levels as 
well as those of the preceding years. 
ï Corporate performance remained subdued, and the impact of moderation in demand 
was visible in the substantial deceleration in sales growth in the second half of 2008-
09. Corporate profitability also exhibited negative growth in the last three successive 
quarters of the year. 
ï The Union Budget for 2009-10, presented against the backdrop of persistent global 
economic slowdown and the associated dampened domestic demand, has placed 
the fiscal deficit at 6.8 per cent of GDP in 2009-10 with a view to providing the 
necessary boost to demand and thereby support a faster recovery. Notwithstanding 
the necessity of an expansionary fiscal response to the growth slowdown, there is a 
need to address the challenges for fiscal consolidation with a view to returning to the 
high growth path at the earliest.  
External Economy 
ï Reflecting the contraction in global demand due to the synchronised global 
recession, exports have declined since October 2008 for eight successive months. 
Imports growth also witnessed a deceleration during October-November 2008, 
before turning negative thereafter. The merchandise trade deficit declined during 
2009-10 (April-May) over the corresponding period of the previous year, reflecting 
the sharper decline in the imports in relation to exports. 
ï The lower trade deficit emanating from moderation in oil prices resulted in a 
turnaround in the current account to a modest surplus during the fourth quarter of 
2008-09, after recording deficits for seven consecutive quarters. 
ï  For the year as a whole, net capital flows fell from US$ 108.0 billion in 2007-08 to 
US$ 9.1 billion in 2008-09, while the current account deficit widened from 1.5 per 
cent of GDP to 2.6 per cent of GDP during the same period. The impact of a severe  3
external shock on Indiaís BoP was managed with a loss of reserves of only US$ 
20.1 billion (net of valuation) without resorting to any extraordinary measures. 
ï The lead information on certain indicators of the capital account suggests revival in 
capital flows to India during first quarter of 2009-10, after the net outflows in 
successive two quarters in the second half of 2008-09. The contraction in exports 
and imports, however, continues. Indiaís foreign exchange reserves increased from 
US$ 252 billion at end-March 2009 to US$ 266 billion by July 17, 2009. The debt 
sustainability indicators remained at comfortable levels at end-March 2009. 
Monetary Conditions 
ï The conduct of monetary policy had to contend with the scale and pace of external 
shocks and their spillover effects through the real, financial and confidence 
channels. The thrust of the various policy initiatives has been on providing ample 
rupee liquidity, ensuring comfortable US dollar liquidity and maintaining a market 
environment conducive for continued flow of credit to the productive sectors.  
ï Since mid-September 2008, the policy repo rate has been reduced by 425 basis 
points, the reverse repo rate has been brought down by 275 basis points and the 
actual/potential liquidity injection/availability is over Rs.5,61,700 crore (excluding 
Rs.40, 000 crore under SLR reduction). These measures taken by the Reserve 
Bank have ensured availability of ample liquidity in the banking system, which was 
evident in the large and regular absorption of the surplus from the system through 
LAF by the Reserve Bank.  
ï Broad money growth (year-on-year) remained high at 20.0 per cent (up to July 3, 
2009), driven by robust growth in deposits (21.0 per cent) on the components side 
and significant increase in banking system's credit to the Government (48.0 per 
cent) on the sources side. Market absorption of the government borrowing 
programme was facilitated by dampened demand for credit from the private sector in 
the face of a high deposit growth. 
Financial Markets 
ï The Indian financial markets continued to function normally and exhibited stability 
with lower volatility and higher volumes in the first quarter of 2009-10. The call rates 
hovered around the reverse repo rate. The commercial paper market exhibited 
greater activity. The government securities market witnessed increase in volume in 
the primary segment reflecting the large borrowing programme of the Government. 
The yield curve has steepened, particularly at the short end reflecting ample 
liquidity, and in response to the large government borrowing programme.  
ï Gross and net issuances of dated securities of the Central Government during 2009-
10 are budgeted higher by 65.2 per cent and 83.4 per cent, respectively, over 2008-
09. During 2009-10 (up to July 22, 2009), the Central Government completed a 
large part (45.4 percent) of the budgeted net borrowing programme (including 
amounts raised through 364-day Treasury Bills and de-sequestering of MSS 
account). Ample liquidity available in the system has facilitated the borrowing 
programme. 
ï The credit market, which had functioned normally even when the global markets 
were experiencing a severe freeze, witnessed better transmission of monetary 
policy rates, as both deposit and lending rates which moderated in the fourth quarter 
of 2008-09 exhibited further moderation in the first quarter of 2009-10. The growth in 
non-food credit which witnessed deceleration since October 2008 has also reversed 
from June 2009, indicating signs of revival in demand for credit.  
Inflation Situation 
ï The WPI inflation, which was on a path of sharp decline from the high peak level of 
August 2008, turned negative in June 2009, and since then the negative inflation 
continues (-1.2 per cent as on July 11, 2009). The decline in the year-on-year  4
inflation essentially reflects the statistical factor of high base that emanated from 
sharp increases in commodities prices during the first half of 2008-09.  
ï Notwithstanding the negative WPI inflation, food articles inflation (i.e. primary as well 
as manufactured) remains high at 8.9 per cent (as on July 11, 2009). Inflation as per 
Consumer Price Indices (CPIs) also continues at elevated levels (in the range of 8.6 
per cent to 11.5 per cent for different consumer price indices in May/June 2009).  
Growth and Inflation Outlook 
ï The Industrial Outlook Survey of the Reserve Bank conducted in April-May 2009 
shows a turnaround in the business sentiment. For the manufacturing companies in 
the private sector, the business expectations indices based on an ìassessment for 
April-June 2009î and on ìexpectations for July-September 2009î improved sharply 
by 20.3 and 14.0 per cent, respectively, over the previous quarter, when these 
indices had recorded their lowest levels since the inception of the Survey. The 
results of the latest round of Survey of Professional Forecastersí conducted by the 
Reserve Bank in June 2009 indicate overall (median) growth rate for 2009-10 at 6.5 
per cent, which is higher from 5.7 per cent that was reported through the findings of 
the earlier survey conducted in March 2009. The Survey also indicates average 
inflation in the fourth quarter of 2009-10 to be about 5.4 per cent. 
ï The growth outlook for 2009-10 needs to be assessed in the context of indications 
emerging from lead indicators so far. While indicators such as the higher growth in 
core infrastructure sector, positive growth in IIP, gradual revival in demand for non-
food credit, improving performance of the corporate sector in terms of both sales 
and profitability, gradual return of risk appetite in the capital market, more optimistic 
business expectations and forecasts as reflected in the Reserve Bankís surveys 
could be viewed as signs of recovery from the slowdown, there are other factors 
which may dampen the growth outlook such as the delayed progress of monsoon, 
decline in exports due to the persistence of global recession, lagged impact of the 
negative growth in manufacturing in the last quarter of 2008-09 on services demand, 
negative growth in capital goods, decline in the production of commercial vehicles, 
and an accelerated fall in import growth suggesting dampened demand conditions. 
ï On the inflation front, there are indications of inflation firming up by the end of the 
year due to the waning base effect of last year, increase in commodity prices, 
delayed progress of monsoon potentially driving up food prices, the inflationary 
implications of expansionary fiscal policy and accommodative monetary policy, and 
inflation expectations not declining in step with the WPI inflation in the face of CPI 
inflation remaining firm. The inflationary pressures may remain moderate if the 
protracted global recession leads to dampened commodity prices, agricultural 
growth remains unaffected despite the delayed progress of monsoon, and the 
accommodative monetary policy stance returns to normal levels. 
ï Indiaís structural growth impulses continue to remain strong, given the high 
domestic saving rate, sound financial system, and growth supportive 
macroeconomic policy environment. Domestic deceleration in demand and 
persistent uncertainty in the global conditions, however, operate as the major drag 
on a faster recovery. Early indications for India suggest that the revival impulses 
need to strengthen further to boost the consumer and investor confidence, which 
could then set off a positive feedback loop to lift the growth momentum over time.
