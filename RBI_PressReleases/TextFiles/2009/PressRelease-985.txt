Surrender of Primary Dealership Authorisation  
by DSP Merrill Lynch Securities Trading Limited 
 
DSP Merrill Lynch Securities Trading Limited would cease to be a primary 
dealer with effect from June 22, 2009.   
 
Pursuant to an agreement for merger between Bank of America Corporation, 
the parent company of Bank of America, N. A. and Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc., DSP 
Merrill Lynch Securities Trading Limited has become a subsidiary of Bank of America 
Corporation.   DSP Merrill Lynch Securities Trading Limited has, therefore, decided 
to surrender the primary dealership authorization granted to them.  Bank of America, 
N.A. would, however, continue to undertake primary dealership business as a 
departmental activity.
