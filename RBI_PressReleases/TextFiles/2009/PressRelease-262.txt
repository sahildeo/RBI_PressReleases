RBI places the draft guidelines on issuance of Non-Convertible Debentures 
(NCDs) of maturity less than one year for comments 
 
The Reserve Bank of India has, today, placed the draft guidelines on the 
issuance of Non-Convertible Debentures (NCDs) of maturity less than one year (annex) 
for comments. 
 
It may be noted that presently, issuance of the NCDs with original maturity of 
less than one year is not regulated either by the SEBI or the Govt. of India. Often, these 
instruments are issued with call/put options embedded in it, which impart a demand-
liability like character to these instruments. The High Level Co-ordination Committee on 
Financial Markets (HLCCFM) had taken the view that these instruments need to be 
regulated as they have systemic implications and such instruments, being money 
market instruments in terms of the provisions of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, 
should be regulated by the Reserve Bank. Accordingly, an internal Working Group with 
representation from the SEBI and the RBI was constituted to examine the legal issues 
in regulating the issuance of the NCDs with maturity of less than one year, which were 
discussed by the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) on Money, Foreign Exchange 
and Government Securities Market at its meeting held on September 23, 2009.  
 
Comments on the draft guidelines may be forwarded to the Chief General 
Manager, Internal Debt Management Department, Reserve Bank of India, Central 
rd
Office Building, 23 floor, Shahid Bhagat Singh Road, Fort, Mumbai - 400001 or 
emailed to by November 20, 2009.
