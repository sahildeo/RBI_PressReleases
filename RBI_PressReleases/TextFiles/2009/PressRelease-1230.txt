De-sequestering of MSS Balances 
 
On a review of its cash position, the Government of India, in consultation with the 
Reserve Bank of India, decided to transfer an amount of Rs.28,000 crore from the MSS 
cash account to the normal cash account of the Government of India on May 2, 2009. 
An equivalent amount of Government securities would accordingly form part of the 
normal borrowing of the Government of India for the fiscal year 2009-10. 
 
It may be recalled that following the amendment to the Memorandum of 
Understanding on the Market Stabilisation Scheme (MSS), an amount of Rs.12,000 
crore was transferred from the MSS cash account to the normal cash account of the 
Government of India on March 4, 2009. An equivalent amount of Government securities 
accordingly formed part of the normal borrowing of the Government of India for the 
fiscal year 2008-09. It was also decided that based on the emerging fund requirements 
of the Government, Rs.33,000 crore of MSS balances will be de-sequestered against 
the approved market borrowing programme or bought back in the fiscal year 2009-10. 
 
The MSS outstanding as on May 2, 2009 is Rs.42,773 crore (Face Value).
