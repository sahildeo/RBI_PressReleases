RBI's Rajbhasha Shield Awards Ceremony 
 
 Dr. D. Subbarao, Governor, Reserve Bank of India while awarding the 
Rajbhasha Shields for the year 2007-2008, said that if banks want to enhance their 
relationship with the public they will have to work in the language of the people, i.e., 
Hindi. Today, Hindi media is so wide spread that we are speaking more and more 
Hindi.  He said that everyone will agree that when a senior officer speaks in Hindi it has 
a positive impact on the rest.  
 
 Smt. Usha Thorat, Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India while complimenting 
the prize winning banks and financial institutions observed that all of us are directly 
linked to financial education and this mission will be successful only when we explain 
banking to the public in their language.  Teaching banking in other regional languages 
along with Hindi will be favourable because these languages will pull the customers at 
the bank's doorsteps, she said.  Through the medium of language customers feel a 
sense of belonging and this will bring customers closer to the banks. 
 
The annual Reserve Bank Rajbhasha Shield was instituted in 1980 to encourage 
public sector banks to use Hindi in their day-to-day work. The Reserve Bank also 
conducts a competition for the house journals of banks and financial institutions. The 
Reserve Bank started an Inter-Bank Hindi Essay Competition from 2002-03. 
 
Earlier, Shri V. S. Das, Executive Director, Reserve Bank of India welcomed the 
Chief Executives of banks and financial institutions. Shri Prabal Sen, Principal Chief 
General Manager, Department of Administration and Personnel Management, Reserve 
Bank of India, proposed a vote of thanks. Ms. Roopam Misra, General Manager, 
Rajbhasha Department, Reserve Bank of India conducted the programme.  
 
 The function was attended by chairmen and other senior executives of banks 
and financial institutions.
