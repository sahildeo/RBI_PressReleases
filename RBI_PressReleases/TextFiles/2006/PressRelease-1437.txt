A Status Note on Liquidity Conditions
Liquidity conditions became tighter from mid-December 2005 due to IMD
redemptions of US$ 7.1 billion, build-up of Government of India (GOI) cash
balances and sustained credit growth.
• Liquidity impact of IMD redemptions was about Rs.32,000 crore.
• The average GOI cash balances with RBI between December 2005 and
February 2006 was higher by about Rs.18,000 crore as compared to
January-November 2005.
• The Credit-Deposit (CD) ratio of the banking system stood at a high of 71
per cent as on February 17, 2006. Also, the incremental credit-deposit
ratio has been more than 100 per cent for two consecutive years.
Liquidity Injections:
Since mid-December 2005, the injections through LAF, MSS unwinding and
market operations have far exceeded the IMD Redemptions and the build up in
Government cash balances.
• Average daily net injections through LAF repos: Rs.12,951 crore
• MSS unwinding: Rs.25,072 crore
• Average daily refinance provided: Rs.2,208 crore
• In addition, RBI’s forex operations and private placement of dated G-sec
of Rs.10,000 crore also had a positive impact on liquidity.
Short-term rates:
• The call money rates which had generally risen since the IMD
redemptions have shown distinct signs of easing since the last week of
February 2006. The call money rate has averaged 6.60 per cent since
February 25, 2006.
• In assessing movements in short-term interest rates, collateralised
segments viz.,  market repos and Collateralised Borrowing and Lending
Obligations (CBLO) have also to be considered since they account forabout 70 percent of the market volumes since mid-December. In February
2006 when call rates had averaged 6.79 per cent, the average rates for
market repo and CBLO were 6.21 per cent and 6.14 per cent,
respectively, well within the indicative corridor.
Short-term Outlook:
• The repo volumes under LAF have now declined to more neutral levels. In
March 2006, so far they have averaged Rs.6,645 crore compared with
Rs.13,766 crore in February 2006.
• Transient factors affecting market liquidity such as advance tax flows can
put some pressures in mid-March, which can be managed through the RBI
refinance or the repo window.
• Government spending, specially by the States, is expected to pick up.
• Going ahead, it is expected that banks will act to raise deposit growth.
This will also be aided by lagged impact of credit flow on deposit growth.
Looking Ahead:
• There is an apprehension that the conversion of recapitalisation bonds
into SLR bonds will put pressure on interest rates. The conversion will be
spread over a period of time after the current fiscal year, depending upon
the liquidity and market conditions.
• In the context of FRBM, RBI has commenced active Open Market
Operations (OMO) on the NDS-OM platform. These could be intensified
as appropriate.
• Reserve Bank would continue to undertake monetary operations
consistent with the interest rate regime. RBI has a range of instruments to
manage liquidity in line with the monetary policy stance.
