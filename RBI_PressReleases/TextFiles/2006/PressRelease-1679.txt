Collection of account payee cheque –
Prohibition on crediting proceeds to third party account
In view of the recent misuse of Initial Public Offer (IPO) process by certain
individuals/entities and reports received in this regard from Securities and Exchange
Board of India (SEBI), the Reserve Bank of India took up detailed investigations at
some banks to ascertain the modus operandi adopted by different parties in
manipulating the system. It was observed that despite extant instructions, banks had
credited the proceeds of individual account payee refund orders into the accounts of
the brokers instead of to the individual accounts on the request of the associates of
DP providers.  This has resulted in manipulation of the payment system and has
facilitated the perpetration of irregularities. This manipulation would not have taken
place but for the banks deviating from the procedure for collection of account payee
cheques. The deviations can also not be sanctified as a prudent market practice
since it has the potential to expose the banks to various risks.
The Reserve Bank has considered it necessary to prohibit the banks from
crediting 'account payee' cheque to the account of any person other than the payee
named therein. The Reserve Bank accordingly directed the banks that they should
not collect account payee cheques for any person other than the payee constituent.
A circular in this regard has since been posted on the RBI Web-site
(www.rbi.org.in).
