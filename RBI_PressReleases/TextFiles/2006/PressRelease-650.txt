Reserve Bank Cancels the Licence of
The Kanyaka Parameshwari Mutually Aided Co-operative Urban Bank Ltd., Andhra
Pradesh
In view of the fact that the The Kanyaka Parameshwari Mutually Aided Co-operative
Urban Bank Ltd., Kukatpally, R.R. District, Andhra Pradesh had ceased to be solvent, all
efforts to revive it in close consultation with the Government of Andhra Pradesh had failed
and the depositors of the bank were being inconvenienced by continued uncertainty, the
Reserve Bank of India delivered the order, canceling its licence to the bank after the close of
business on August 16, 2006. The Registrar of Co-operative Societies, Andhra Pradesh has
also been requested to issue an order for winding up of the bank and appoint a Liquidator for
the bank. It may be highlighted that on liquidation every depositor is entitled to repayment of
his deposits up to a monetary ceiling of Rs.1,00,000/- (Rupees One lakh only) from the
Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC).
The bank was granted a licence by the Reserve Bank on July 21, 1997 to commence
banking business. The statutory inspection of the bank conducted by the Reserve Bank with
reference to its financial position as on March 31, 2004 revealed that the bank had violated
several guidelines/instructions of the Reserve Bank. The bank was facing liquidity problems
during January 2005 due to a run on its deposits. In order to protect the interests of the
depositors, the bank was placed under directions issued under Section 35A of the B. R. Act,
1949 (AACS) vide order dated January 27, 2005. On a requisition by the Bank, the RCS
superseded the Board of Directors of the bank vide order dated March 14, 2005.
The subsequent inspection of the bank conducted by the Reserve Bank of India with
reference to its financial position as on March 31, 2005 revealed further deterioration in its
financial condition.  Its deposits were getting eroded, as realisable value of paid up capital
and reserves was negative.  The Reserve Bank issued a notice to the bank on April 26, 2006
asking it to show cause as to why the licence granted to it to conduct banking business
should not be cancelled. The bank's reply to the Show Cause Notice was examined and was
found unacceptable.
Based on the reply to the show cause notice and after being satisfied that the chances
of its revival were remote the Reserve Bank of India took the extreme measure of canceling
licence of the bank after examining all options for its revival, in the interest of the bank's
depositors. With the cancellation of its licence and commencement of liquidation
proceedings, the process of paying the depositors of The Kanyaka Parameshwari Mutually
Aided Co-operative Urban Bank Ltd. the amount insured as per the DICGC Act will be set in
motion.
Consequent to the cancellation of its licence, the The Kanyaka Parameshwari Mutually
Aided Co-operative Urban Bank Ltd., is prohibited from carrying on 'banking business' as
defined in Section 5(b) of the B. R. Act, 1949 (AACS) including acceptance and repayment of
deposits.
