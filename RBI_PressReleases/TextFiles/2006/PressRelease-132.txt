RBI announces rate of interest on FRB, 2009 
 
The rate of interest on the Government of India Floating Rate Bonds, 2009 
(FRB, 2009) applicable for the half-year (December 6, 2006 to June 5, 2007) shall be 
6.92 per cent per annum. 
 
2. It may be recalled that the rate of interest on the FRB, 2009 was set at a mark-
up (as decided in the auction held on December 5, 2001) over and above the variable 
base rate. The variable base rate for payment of interest shall be the average rate 
(rounded off up to two decimal places) of the implicit yields at cut-off prices emerging 
in six auctions of Government of India 364-day Treasury Bills immediately preceding 
the relative half yearly coupon reset date. The variable base rate based on the 
average rate of the implicit yields at cut-off prices of the said last six auctions of 
Government of India 364-day Treasury Bills works out to be 6.93 per cent. The mark-
up decided in the auction held on December 5, 2001 was (-) 0.01 per cent (minus one 
basis point). The coupon rate has been fixed accordingly.
