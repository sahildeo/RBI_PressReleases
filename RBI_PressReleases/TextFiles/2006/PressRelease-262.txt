Draft Guidelines on Lending to Priority Sector – Revised
The draft Technical Paper submitted by the Internal Working Group
(Chairman: Shri C.S. Murthy) set up by the Reserve Bank to review the existing
policy on priority sector lending was placed on the Reserve Bank’s website on
September 30, 2005 for wider dissemination and comments. Based on the feedback
received from the banks, financial institutions, Non-Banking Financial Companies,
Associations of Industries, media, public and Indian Banks’ Association, the
guidelines on priority sector lending have been revised.
As per the revised draft guidelines, the priority sector will broadly comprise
agriculture, small scale industries, small business/service enterprises, micro credit,
education loans and housing loans. The priority sector lending target and sub-targets
for all banks would now be linked to Adjusted Net Bank Credit (Net Bank Credit plus
investments made by banks in non-SLR bonds held in HTM category) or Credit
Equivalent of Off-Balance Sheet Exposures, whichever is higher, as on March 31 of
the previous year. For this purpose, outstanding FCNR (B) and NRNR deposits
balances will no longer be deducted for computation of Net Bank Credit for priority
sector lending purposes. These guidelines also take into account the revised
definition of small and micro enterprises as per the Micro, Small and Medium
Enterprises Development Act, 2006.
As announced in the Mid-Term Review of the Annual Policy Statement 2006-
07, the Reserve Bank of India has placed the Revised Draft Circular on Lending to
Priority Sector on its website (www.rbi.org.in). Views/ comments on the revised draft
circular may be sent to cgmincrpcd@rbi.org.in or faxed to 022-22610943 or
22610948.
