Committee on Fuller Capital Account Convertibility submits its Report
The Committee on Fuller Capital Account Convertibility submitted its
report to the Reserve Bank of India today. The Reserve Bank will place the report
in the public domain in due course.
It may be recalled that the Reserve Bank of India had appointed the
Committee in March this year in consultation with the Government of India to set
out the framework for Fuller Capital Account Convertibility.  Shri S S Tarapore
chaired the Committee which had Shri M. G. Bhide, Dr. R. H. Patil,
Dr. Surjit Bhalla, Shri A. V. Rajwade and Dr. Ajit Ranade as its members.
India's cautious approach towards opening of the capital account and
viewing capital account liberalisation as a process contingent upon certain
preconditions has served India well. Given the changes that had taken place over
the last two decades, however, there was merit in moving towards Fuller Capital
Account Convertibility within a transparent framework. There was, therefore, a
need to revisit the subject and the Committee was appointed to suggest a
roadmap towards Fuller Capital Account Convertibility based on current realities.
The Reserve Bank provided the secretariat to the Committee.
