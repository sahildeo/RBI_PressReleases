FMD to handle RBI's Domestic Foreign Exchange Operations
The Financial Markets Department (FMD) of the Reserve Bank of India has taken
over the function of conducting the Reserve Bank’s operations in domestic foreign
exchange market from January 2, 2006. When created in July 2005, FMD was
entrusted with monetary operations, such as, open market operations, liquidity
adjustment facility and market stabilisation scheme, regulation and development of
money market instruments and monitoring of money, government securities and foreign
exchange markets. Inclusion of foreign exchange market operations in FMD’s functions
would help the Reserve Bank achieve the desired integration in its conduct of monetary
operations.
It may be recalled that the Reserve Bank of India had, on July 6, 2005,
announced constitution of a new Financial Markets Department with a view to moving
towards functional separation between debt management and monetary operations. At
the time of the constitution of the new department, it was indicated that the functions of
the new department would also cover the Reserve Bank’s operations in the domestic
foreign exchange market.
The restructuring of domestic financial market operations in this manner is
expected to strengthen monetary, debt management and reserves management
functions of the Reserve Bank by moving towards functional separation in these
objectives.
