Major sources of accretion to foreign exchange reserves during the first quarter 
2006-07 have been External Commercial Borrowing (ECB), banking capital and foreign 
investment. The accretion to the foreign exchange reserves was of the order of US $ 
6.4 billion on a BoP basis (excluding valuation effects) during April-June 2006. Valuation 
gain, reflecting the appreciation of major currencies against the US dollar, accounted for 
a rise of US $ 4.9 billion in total reserves during the first quarter 2006-07 as against a 
valuation loss of US $ 4.3 billion during corresponding period previous year. Taking into 
account the valuation gain of US $ 4.9 billion, foreign exchange reserves recorded an 
increase of US $ 11.3 billion during April-June 2006-07 (a decrease of US $ 3.1 billion 
during April-June 2005-06).
