RBI to introduce Star series Banknote
The Reserve Bank of India at present issues fresh banknote packets containing
one hundred (100) serially numbered banknotes. Each banknote bears a distinctive
serial number along with a prefix.  The prefix consists of the numeral and a
letter/letters and is followed by a serial number. The number e.g. could be
4CC 456917.
In a serially numbered packet, banknotes with any defect, detected at the
printing stage, are replaced at the note printing presses by banknotes having the same
number so that the sequence of the packet is maintained. As a part of the Bank’s
ongoing efforts to benchmark its procedures against international best practices as
also for cost effectiveness at printing presses, it is proposed to adopt the STAR series
numbering system for replacement of the defectively printed banknotes.
The Star series notes, to begin with, will be issued in lower denominations, that
is, Rs.10, Rs.20 and Rs.50. The Star series notes will look exactly like the existing
notes of Rs.10, Rs.20 and Rs.50 in the Mahatma Gandhi series but will have an
additional character viz. a *(star) in the number panel. Packets with star series notes
will have 100 pieces as usual but not in serial order. The Star series notes will be legal
tender and members of public may freely accept and use these notes.
Consequently, some fresh banknote packets issued by the Bank may contain
some notes having a *(star) in the number panel in the space between the prefix and
the number. The packet will contain 100 banknotes, as hitherto. The number e.g. may
be 4CC*456987. To facilitate easy identification of note packets containing star series
notes, the bands on such packets will clearly indicate the presence of these notes in
the packet.
