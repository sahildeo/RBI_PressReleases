“Quarterly Statistics on Deposits and Credit of
Scheduled Commercial Banks: June 2006" – Press Note
 “Quarterly Statistics on Deposits and Credit of Scheduled Commercial Banks –
June 2006” provides data on aggregate deposits and gross bank credit of scheduled
commercial banks as on last Friday of June 2006. The data are based on Basic
Statistical Return-7, received from the branches of all scheduled commercial banks
(including Regional Rural Banks). During this quarter, there was amalgamation of 36
RRBs into 12 RRBs leading to reduction in number of RRBs from 133 as at quarter-end
March 2006 to 109 as at quarter-end June 2006.
Population group classification of banked centres used for the March 2006
quarter and onwards, has been based on the population figures of 2001 census as
against earlier classification of banked centres based on the 1991 census. However the
definition/cut-off size of population groups remains unchanged.
On account of updation of population group classification as per 2001 census in
March 2006, there have been changes in the composition of branches/offices of banks.
The changes in distribution pattern of population group of branches/ offices and banked
centers has impacted the population group-wise growth rates of aggregate deposits and
gross bank credit. For data pertaining to quarters upto December 2005, the banked
centers were categorized on the 1991 census figures whereas for March 2006 quarter
onwards as per 2001 census figures. Therefore, the population group-wise comparison
with the quarters upto December 2005 may not hold good. However, the figures
according to other characteristics are comparable.
The population group-wise growth rates for June 2006 have been worked out
taking into account the comparable position of June 2005, i.e., reclassifying the
branches in 2005 as per 2001 census. For details, please refer to the Highlights
published in the March 2006 issue of the publication.
