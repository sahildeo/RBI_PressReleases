RBI asks Banks to credit Interest Relief to
Farmers' Accounts before March 31, 2006
The Reserve Bank of India has asked the banks to credit the farmers’
accounts before March 31, 2006 with interest relief of two percentage points in the
interest rate on the principal amount upto Rs1 lakh of crop loans availed by the
farmers for Kharif and Rabi 2005-06. Banks can seek reimbursement from
Reserve Bank  after crediting the relief to farmers’ accounts, it said in a circular
issued to banks today.
It may be recalled that Paragraph 48 of the Union Budget Speech envisages
grant of interest relief of two percentage points in the interest rate on the principal
amount up to Rs1 lakh of crop loans availed by the farmers for Kharif and Rabi
2005-06.  The amount of the relief is required to be credited to the borrower's
account before March 31, 2006.
Detailing the method for calculating the interest relief, the Reserve Bank
circular said that:
(a) All crop loans for Kharif and Rabi disbursed to farmers during the
financial year 2005-06 will be eligible for the interest relief of two
percentage points. However, where each crop loan exceeds Rs.1 lakh,
the interest relief will be applicable on the principal amount up to Rs.1
lakh.
(b) Interest relief may be calculated at two percentage points on the
amount of the crop loan disbursed from the date of
disbursement/drawal up to the date of payment, or upto the date
beyond which the outstanding loan becomes overdue, that is, March 31,
2006 for Kharif and June 30, 2006 for Rabi, respectively, whichever is
earlier.
Banks have been asked to submit their claims to the Reserve Bank of India
and they will be reimbursed by way of credit to their accounts with the Reserve
Bank of India within one month of the date of receipt of the claim.
Suitable instructions to cooperative banks and Regional Rural Banks will be
issued by National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD)
separately.
