Reserve Bank Cancels the Licence of  the Sindh Mercantile Co-op. Bank Ltd.,
Ahmedabad (Gujarat State)
In view of the fact that the Sindh Mercantile Co-op. Bank Ltd. (Gujarat) had ceased to be
solvent, all efforts to revive it in close consultation with the Government of Gujarat had failed and
the depositors were being inconvenienced by continued uncertainty, the Reserve Bank of India
delivered the order cancelling its licence to the bank after the close of business on November 28,
2006. The Registrar of Co-operative Societies, Gujarat State has also been requested to issue an
order for winding up the bank and appoint a liquidator for the bank.  It may be highlighted that on
liquidation every depositor is entitled to repayment of his deposits up to a monetary ceiling of
Rs.1,00,000/- from the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) under usual
rules and procedures.
The bank faced severe liquidity crunch in the month of September 2002.  In order to protect
the interest of the depositors and in the public interest, the bank was placed under directions vide
the Reserve Bank's order dated October 12, 2002.
A statutory inspection of the bank was undertaken with reference to the financial position as
on March 31, 2005 followed by a scrutiny of its financial position as on September 30, 2005.  Since
no improvement was observed in the financial condition of the bank, the bank was issued a Show
Cause Notice (SCN) for cancellation of its licence on December 28, 2005.  The reply of the bank to
the SCN has been found unsatisfactory.
As the bank did not have a viable plan of action for revival and the chances of its revival
were remote, the Reserve Bank of India took the extreme measure of canceling the licence of the
bank after examining all options for its revival, in the interest of the bank's depositors.  With the
cancellation of its licence and after commencement of liquidation proceedings, the process of
paying the depositors of Sindh Mercantile Co-op. Bank Ltd., Ahmedabad (Gujarat), the amount
insured as per the DICGC Act, will be set in motion.
Consequent to the cancellation of its licence, the Sindh Mercantile Co-op. Bank Ltd.,
Ahmedabad (Gujarat) is prohibited from carrying on ‘Banking business’ as defined in Section 5(b)
of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (AACS) including acceptance and repayment of deposits.
