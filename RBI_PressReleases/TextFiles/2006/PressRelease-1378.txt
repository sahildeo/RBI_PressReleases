Market Stabilisation Scheme
In accordance with the provisions of the Memorandum of Understanding
(MOU) of the Market Stabilisation Scheme (MSS), the annual ceiling for 2006-07
is being fixed at Rs. 70,000 crore while annual ceiling for 2005-06 is Rs.80,000
crore. The threshold level at which the ceiling will be reviewed in 2006-07 has
been fixed at Rs. 60,000 crore. The revised ceilings and thresholds have been
agreed upon between the Government of India and the Reserve Bank.
It may be recalled that on December 30, 2005, the Reserve Bank had
announced its decision to suspend the issue of Treasury Bills and dated
securities under the Market Stabilisation Scheme (MSS). This decision would
continue till such time as is necessary. However, within the overall MSS ceiling
for 2006-07, the Reserve Bank would retain the flexibility of conducting auctions
under the MSS from time to time with sufficient notice to the market, in response
to evolving circumstances.
