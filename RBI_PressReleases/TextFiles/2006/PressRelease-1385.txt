RBI takes penal action against Jammu and Kashmir Bank Ltd.
The Reserve Bank of India,  in exercise of powers vested in it under
the provisions of Section 47 A (1)(b) of the Banking Regulation Act 1949, has
imposed a monetary penalty of Rs.5.00 lakhs (Rupees five lakhs only) on
Jammu and Kashmir Bank Ltd.,  for violation of Sec 20(1) of Banking
Regulation Act 1949.
While granting Letter of Credit facilities to one of its constituents, the
bank had failed to ensure that adequate and effective arrangements were
made by the constituent to meet the commitments under the LCs, even
though the bank was aware that one of the Directors on its Board, was also a
Director on the Board of its constituent.   This had resulted in devolvement of
LC on the bank and fund based exposure to the constitutent and thereby
violating the provisions of Sec 20 (1) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949.
The Reserve Bank had issued a Show Cause notice to the bank. In
response to the show cause notice, the bank had submitted its written reply
and the Chief Executive Officer had also sought personal hearing with the
Reserve Bank which was granted.
On careful examination of the bank's submissions, the Reserve Bank
has come to a conclusion that the aforesaid violation was substantiated and
accordingly the penalty was imposed.  The details of the irregularity / violation
have been placed on the RBI website.
It may be recalled that in October 2004, as a part of measures to
improve the transparency of banks, the Reserve Bank had announced its
decision to disclose in public domain information on penalties imposed on
banks after due process of advising a bank and seeking its explanation as
also after giving the bank an opportunity for being heard.
