Rs.5.00 lakh (rupees five lakh only) on the Jamkhed Merchants Co-operative Bank  Ltd.,
Jamkhed, Dist. Ahmednagar for violation of the Reserve Bank of India’s directives
dated October 1, 2003 prohibiting loans and advances to directors and their relatives
and the firms/companies/concerns in which they are interested with effect from the
