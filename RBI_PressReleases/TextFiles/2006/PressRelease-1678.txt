Misuse of IPO finance- Penal action taken
The Reserve Bank of India in exercise of powers vested in it under the
provisions of Section 47 A (1)(b) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 imposed
monetary penalties on seven scheduled commercial banks for violation of RBI
regulations on Know Your Customer (KYC) norms, for breach of prudent banking
practices and facilitating misuse of IPO finance to  ineligible borrowers.
The RBI had issued show cause notices to all these banks. In response
thereto banks had submitted their written responses and the CEOs had also
sought personal hearing with the RBI, which was granted. On careful
examination of banks' submission, the RBI has come to a conclusive decision
that the aforesaid violations were substantiated and accordingly the monetary
penalties are imposed.
It may be recalled that in October 2004, as part of measures to improve
the transparency of banks, RBI had announced its decision to disclose in public
domain information on penalties imposed on banks after due process of advising
a bank and seeking its explanation so as to give reasonable opportunity to the
bank for being heard. This is being done separately.
