RBI takes April 1, 2005 as the base date for
Variations in Monetary and Banking Data for 2005-06
The Reserve Bank of India has decided to take April 1, 2005 as the base date for
2005-06 for calculation of variations of monetary and banking data on a financial year
basis.  The base date for 2006-07 continues to be March 31, 2006 as per the usual
practice.
The Reserve Bank publishes the data on monetary and banking aggregates and
their variations on a fortnightly basis on alternate Fridays. Conventionally, variations in
banking data for a particular financial year are in relation to the last reporting Friday of
the previous financial year.  Thus, variations during 2005-06 are conventionally
calculated from March 18, 2005 which was the last reporting Friday of 2004-05 i.e., the
previous financial year.  This results in the incorporation of data for an additional
fortnight in the variations in monetary and banking aggregates for 2005-06 in relation to
the same aggregates for 2006-07.  For meaningful comparison of variations in
monetary/banking variables in 2006-07 with those of 2005-06 on a financial year basis,
therefore, the Reserve Bank has decided to take April 1, 2005 as the base date for
2005-06.
The Reserve Bank would follow this convention for reporting variations in
monetary/banking variables during the year in its regular publications.
