Reserve Bank Cancels the Licence of  the Mahila Nagrik Sahkari Bank Maryadit,
Khargone, Madhya Pradesh
 In view of the fact that the Mahila Nagrik Sahkari Bank Maryadit, Khargone , Madhya
Pradesh had ceased to be solvent, all efforts to revive it in close consultation with the
Government of Madhya Pradesh had failed and the depositors were being inconvenienced
by continued uncertainty, the Reserve Bank of India delivered the order cancelling its licence
to the bank after the close of business on  May 2, 2006 .  The Registrar of Co-operative
Societies, Madhya Pradesh has also been requested to issue an order for winding up the
bank and appoint a liquidator for the bank.  It may be highlighted that on liquidation every
depositor is entitled to repayment of his deposits up to a monetary ceiling of Rs. 1,00,000/-
from the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC).
There was a run on the bank and deposits amounting to Rs. 71.94 lakh were
withdrawn from the bank between October 24, 2003 and December 18, 2003.   A scrutiny of
the books of accounts of the bank conducted by the Reserve Bank of India revealed that the
bank’s liquidity position as on 18.12.2003 was severely impaired. Considering its
unsatisfactory financial position, the bank was placed under directions under section 35A of
the Banking Regulation Act, 1949(AACS) with effect from the close of business on February
25,2004, which inter alia restricted repayment of deposits to Rs.1000 per depositor. The
inspection of the bank with reference to its position as on March 31, 2005 revealed
deterioration in its financial condition. The realisable value of paid-up capital and reserves
was in the negative and its deposits were fully eroded.  Thereafter, the Reserve Bank issued
a notice to the bank on October 07, 2005 asking it to show cause as to why the licence
granted to it to conduct banking business should not be cancelled.   As the bank did not have
a viable plan of action for revival and the chances of its revival were remote, the Reserve
Bank of India took the extreme measure of canceling licence of the bank after examining all
options for its revival, in the interest of the bank's depositors.  With the cancellation of its
licence and after commencement of liquidation proceedings, the process of paying the
depositors of Mahila Nagrik Sahkari Bank Maryadit, Khargone , Madhya Pradesh, the amount
insured as per the DICGC Act, will be set in motion.
Consequent to the cancellation of its licence, the Mahila Nagrik Sahkari Bank
Maryadit, Khargone , Madhya Pradesh is prohibited from carrying on ‘banking business’ as
defined in Section 5(b) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (AACS) including acceptance
and repayment of deposits.
