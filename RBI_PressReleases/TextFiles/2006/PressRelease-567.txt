The Government of India had, on January 24, 2006, sanctioned the

Scheme of Amalgamation.
Accordingly, the Government of India has today issued a notification
bringing the Scheme of Amalgamation of The Ganesh Bank of Kurundwad Ltd.
with The Federal Bank Ltd. into force with effect from September 2, 2006. All the
branches of The Ganesh Bank of Kurundwad Ltd. will function as branches of The
Federal Bank Ltd. with effect from this date.

will be able to operate their accounts as customers of The Federal Bank Ltd. with
effect from September 2, 2006. The Federal Bank Ltd. is making necessary
arrangements to ensure that service, as usual, is provided to the customers of
