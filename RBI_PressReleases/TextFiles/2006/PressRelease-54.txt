Reserve Bank of India to circulate  
New  Ferritic Stainless Steel Rs.2 Coins  
 
The Reserve Bank of India will shortly put into circulation new Ferritic Stainless 
Steel Rs.2 Coins with the theme "unity in diversity".  
 
The coins are circular in shape with 27 millimeters diameter with a metal 
composition of 17 percent chromium and 83 percent iron. 
 
The face of the coin has three portions. The centre portion bears the Lion Capitol 
of Ashoka Pillar with the legend inscribed below and the prominent 
¬¸÷¡¸Ÿ¸½¨¸ ?¸¡¸÷¸½ 
international numerals "2" indicating the denomination. The top portion contains the 
word ž¸¸£÷¸ in Hindi and "India" in English. The bottom portion contains the year in 
international numerals. The reverse face of the coin shows stylised representation of 
"Unity in Diversity" a defining characteristic of our country. The symbol shall be seen as 
four heads sharing a common body.  It shall be thought of as people from all four parts 
of the country coming together under one banner and identifying with one nation. The 
visual code helps the user connect the visual with an individual denomination, which 
makes the process of identification quicker. The left upper periphery contains the words 
™¸½ ²œ¸¡¸¸ in Hindi and "Two Rupees" in English. 
 
The coin is a legal tender as provided in the Coinage Act, 1906.  The existing 
Two Rupees Coins in circulation shall also continue to be legal tender.
