International Best Practices:
RBI Departments receive BS7799 Certification
The Reserve Bank of India has received BS7799 certification for two of its
important work areas, namely, internal debt management and external investments
and operations handled by its two departments namely, Internal Debt Management
Department and Department of External Investments and Operations. Currency
management and banking are the other two work areas of the Reserve Bank to have
received ISO 9001-2000 certification earlier this month.
BS7799 standards are internationally recognised information security
management standards, which define the desired methods of controlling the
confidentiality, integrity and availability of information. The certification under these
standards implies establishment/existence of requisite policies for information
security management, their effective implementation and suitable mechanism for
improvement in the domain, in tandem with the functional information security
requirements.
 Conformity to the standards for BS7799 certification was assessed by
auditors from ICl Certifications Ltd., Panchkula, Haryana, India and CIS-Cert, Gmbh,
Austria. Seeking BS certification was a part of the Reserve Bank's continuing
initiatives to adopt and adhere to international best practices and standards.
The Internal Debt Management Department manages the issuance of the debt
of both Central and State Governments, while the Department of External Investment
and Operations manages the foreign exchange reserves of the Reserve Bank.
