On a review, it has been decided that the interest rate ceiling with

contracted effective close of business in India on March 28, 2006 should not
exceed LIBOR/ SWAP rate (as against 25 basis points below the
LIBOR/SWAP rate effective April 29, 2002) prevailing on the last working day
of the previous month for relevant maturity and currency.
