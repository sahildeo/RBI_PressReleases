RBI penalises Tamilnad Mercantile Bank
The Reserve Bank of India has, in exercise of powers vested in it under the
provisions of Section 47A(1)(b) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, imposed a penalty
of Rs. 5.00 Lakh (Rupees Five Lakh only) on the Tamilnad Mercantile Bank Ltd. The
penalty has been levied for violation of RBI regulations in not ensuring end-use of
bank's funds lent to various borrowers which was also facilitated by not ensuring
diligent compliance with know your customer (KYC) norms in opening the accounts.
The Reserve Bank had issued a show cause notice to the bank. In response to
its show cause notice, the bank submitted a written reply. On a careful examination of
the bank's reply, the Reserve Bank found that as the violations were conclusively
established, the penalty was accordingly imposed.
