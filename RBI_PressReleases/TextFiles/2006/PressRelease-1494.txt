Handbook of Monetary Statistics of India
The Reserve Bank of India today released the Handbook of Monetary Statistics of India.
The publication provides disaggregated data on monetary, banking, prices and select financial
market indicators at annual as well as monthly/fortnightly/weekly frequencies. While
annual/monthly data in most cases are provided from 1950-51 onwards, in the case of the
Reserve Bank’s balance sheet and profit and loss account they are provided from the inception
of the Bank, i.e., 1935 onwards. This publication is expected to be useful for researchers, policy
makers, financial market participants and analysts interested in monetary economics.
It may be recalled that the Reserve Bank of India has been publishing the series
Handbook of Statistics on the Indian Economy since 1998, with a view to improving data
dissemination. The Handbook of Statistics on the Indian Economy provides time series data at
annual, quarterly, monthly and higher frequencies in respect of real, monetary, fiscal, banking,
financial and external sectors of the Indian Economy.  It, thus, provides a storehouse of
statistical information at one place. In addition to the Handbook of Statistics on the Indian
Economy, the Reserve Bank has taken the initiative to bring out sectoral handbooks to provide
in one place disaggregated time-series data relating to a particular sector. As a part of this
initiative, the Handbook of Statistics on State Government Finances was published in 2004.
This process is being carried forward with the publication of the present volume of Handbook of
Monetary Statistics of India which is being released in three versions, viz., in printed form, as a
CD-ROM and as a web-based source.  The CD-ROM incorporates search facilities that allow
users to search across tables enabling the user to select one or more data series for a selected
period from any table. The web-version can be down loaded from the RBI website
(http://www.rbi.org.in).
