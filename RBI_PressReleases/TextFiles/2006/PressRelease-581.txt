Issue of Star Series Banknotes
The Reserve Bank of India will soon issue Star series banknotes. These will
be issued to begin with in Rs.10, Rs.20 and Rs.50 denominations in the Mahatma
Gandhi Series-2005. The Star series banknotes will look exactly like the existing
banknotes of Rs.10, Rs.20 and Rs.50 but will have an additional character, viz.,
*(star) in the number panel between the prefix and the serial number. Consequently,
some fresh banknote packets issued by the Reserve Bank may contain some notes
having a *(star) in the number panel in the space between the prefix and the
number. The bands of the packets containing the Star series number will clearly
indicate the presence of such banknotes in the packets. Fresh note packets with
Star series notes will, as usual, have 100 pieces with the Star series notes placed at
the bottom of the packet. The Star series banknotes will be legal tender and
members of public may freely accept and use these banknotes.
The fresh banknote packets issued by the Reserve Bank of India at present
are serially numbered from 1 to 100. Each banknote bears a distinctive serial
number along with a prefix. Currently defectively printed banknotes in any packet
are replaced at the note printing presses with a good note bearing the same number
as the one with defect in order to maintain the sequential numbering of banknotes in
the packet. This procedure involves additional time/cost and manual intervention.
As part of the ongoing efforts to benchmark its procedures to international
best practices, as also, for cost effectiveness and greater operational efficiency at
note printing presses, the Reserve Bank has adopted the Star series numbering
system for replacement of defectively printed banknotes.  This was announced in
April this year, in the Annual Policy Statement for 2006-07.
