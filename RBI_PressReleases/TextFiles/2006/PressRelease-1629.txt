Monitoring FIIs investment in Indian Companies
The Reserve Bank of India has notified on February 2, 2006 that the holdings
of Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) of the following companies under Portfolio
Investment Scheme (PIS) has reached the limit of 22 per cent of their paid up
capital. The Reserve Bank has further notified that no further purchases of equity
shares of these companies on behalf of FIIs will be allowed without obtaining its prior
approval as these companies have demerged from Reliance Industries Limited.
Since these companies have not passed the requisite resolution for enhancing FIIs
limit, their FII limit would remain as 24 per cent.
