Violation of KYC norms and misuse of IPO finance – Penal Action 
 
The Reserve Bank of India in exercise of powers vested in it under the provisions 
of Section 47 A (1)(b) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 imposed monetary penalty of 
Rs.15 lakh on  Centurion Bank of Punjab Ltd. for violation of RBI guidelines on Know 
Your Customer (KYC) norms relating to opening of accounts including joint accounts, 
for issue of  10200 cheque leaves  to a customer during a short period of two months 
without complying with RBI guidelines, and also for violation of extant RBI guidelines 
relating to IPO financing. 
The RBI had issued a show cause notice to the bank and in response thereto the 
bank had submitted their written response and the CEO of the bank had also sought 
personal hearing with the RBI, which was granted. On careful examination of banks' 
submission, both oral and written, RBI has come to a conclusive decision that the 
aforesaid violations were substantiated and accordingly the monetary penalties are 
imposed. 
 
It may be recalled that in October 2004, as part of measures to improve the 
transparency of banks, RBI had announced its decision to disclose in public domain 
information on penalties imposed on banks after due process of advising a bank and 
seeking its explanation so as to give reasonable opportunity to the bank for being heard.
