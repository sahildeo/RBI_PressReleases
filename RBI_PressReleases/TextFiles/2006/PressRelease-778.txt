Macroeconomic and Monetary Developments
First Quarter Review 2006-07
The Reserve Bank of India today released the document
“Macroeconomic and Monetary Developments: First Quarter Review
2006-07” to serve as a backdrop to the First Quarter Review of the
Annual Statement on Monetary Policy for 2006-07.
The highlights of macroeconomic and monetary developments
during 2006-07 so far are:
The Real Economy
• The cumulative rainfall recorded during June 1 to July 12, 2006
was 10 percent below normal as compared with one per cent
above normal a year ago.
• Industrial production continued with its momentum during April-
May 2006 registering growth of 9.8 per cent. The manufacturing
sector with double digit growth (10.9 per cent) continued to be
the key driver of industrial activity, contributing almost 92.5 per
cent of the growth in industry.
• The infrastructure sector recorded growth of 5.9 per cent during
April-May 2006 as compared with 7.1 per cent during April-May
2005.
• The buoyancy in manufacturing and services sector activities and
the positive business confidence and expectations suggest that
the recent growth momentum in the Indian economy is likely to
be maintained in 2006-07, as has also been projected by
different agencies.
Fiscal Situation
• All the key deficit indicators of the Central Government during
April-May 2006, as proportion to budget estimates, were placed
higher than their levels a year ago. Revenue receipts during
April-May 2006, as proportion to budget estimates, were higher
than in the corresponding period of 2005. Aggregate expenditure
was, however, even higher during April-May 2006 on account of
increase in interest payments, subsidies, grants to States, and
also front loading of transfers to the Public Account of funds forthe Central Road Fund and National Rural Employment
Guarantee Fund.
• During 2006-07 (up to July 18, 2006), gross and net market
borrowings (including dated securities and 364-day Treasury
Bills) raised by the Centre amounted to 38.2 per cent and 30.4
per cent of the budget estimates as compared with 37.2 per cent
and 39.1 per cent, respectively, a year ago.
• During 2006-07 so far (up to July 18, 2006), the States have
raised market loans amounting to Rs. 7,343 crore (30.1 per cent
of gross allocation for the year).
• The weekly average utilisation of WMA and overdraft by the
States during April-June 2006 (Rs.316 crore) was substantially
lower than during the corresponding period of the previous year
(Rs.1,449 crore). The weekly average investment by the States
in the 14-day Treasury Bills during April-June 2006 amounted to
Rs.35,859 crore, considerably higher than that of Rs.21,847
crore during the corresponding period of the previous year.
Monetary and Liquidity Conditions
• Monetary and liquidity conditions, after some tightening during
the last four months of 2005-06, remained comfortable during the
first quarter of 2006-07 despite sustained growth of bank credit.
• Bank deposits and credit recorded strong growth during the first
quarter of 2006-07. Bank deposits and credit have increased by
Rs. 66,268 crore and Rs. 40,789 crore, respectively, during the
fiscal year 2006-07 so far (between March 31, 2006 and July 7,
2006) as compared with Rs. 20,386 crore and Rs. 26,053 crore,
respectively, during the corresponding period of 2005-06
(between April 1, 2005 and July 8, 2005). Scheduled commercial
banks’ non-food credit, on a year-on-year basis, registered a
growth of 32.9 per cent as on July 7, 2006 on top of a high base
of  31.0 per cent a year ago.
• Money supply (M3) expanded by 18.8 per cent on a year-on-year
basis as on July 7, 2006 as compared with 13.8 per cent a year
ago.
• Reserve money expanded by 16.0 per cent on a year-on-year
basis as on July 14, 2006 as compared with 18.0 per cent a year
ago.
Price Situation
• Headline inflation firmed up further in several countries during the
first quarter of 2006-07 in response to sustained pressures from
record high international crude oil prices. Core inflation and
inflation expectations which had so far remained relatively benign
have also edged higher in recent months. With a significant part
of the increase in international crude oil prices being consideredas permanent, many central banks tightened monetary policies
further to contain inflation and inflationary expectations.
• In India, supply-side factors continued to be the major factors
driving inflation during the first quarter of 2006-07.  Apart from
higher oil prices, primary food articles prices also posed upward
pressure on inflation in the first quarter. Nonetheless, headline
inflation remained within the indicative trajectory during the first
quarter of 2006-07.
• In India, year-on-year wholesale price inflation was 4.7 per cent
on July 8, 2006 as compared with 4.5 per cent a year ago.
Financial Markets
• Call money rates eased during the quarter and remained
generally close to the reverse repo rate. Interest rates in the
collateralised segment of the overnight money market remained
below the reverse repo rate and the call rate during the quarter.
• The foreign exchange market remained orderly even as the
Indian rupee depreciated during   May-June 2006.
• Yields in the Government securities market hardened during the
quarter.  The yield curve steepened as the increase at the longer
end was higher than at the short-end.
• Deposit and lending rates edged up during the quarter as credit
demand remained strong.
The External Economy
• India’s balance of payments position remained comfortable
during 2005-06, despite pressures from record high international
crude oil prices. The current account deficit remained modest at
1.3 per cent of GDP. Net inflows under major components of
capital flows were higher than a year ago and the overall balance
of payments (BoP) recorded surplus during 2005-06.
• Developments during April-June 2006 indicate continued robust
growth of merchandise exports and non-oil imports, despite
some deceleration. Oil imports remained large in view of further
hardening of international crude oil prices. The trade deficit
expanded from US $ 10.5 billion during April-June 2005 to US $
12.6 billion during April-June 2006.
• Capital flows, except FII flows, have remained buoyant during
2006-07 so far.
• India’s foreign exchange reserves at US $ 162.7 billion on July
14, 2006 were US $ 11.0 billion higher over end-March 2006.
