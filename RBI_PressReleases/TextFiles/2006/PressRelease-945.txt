Reserve Bank Cancels the Licence of The Parbhani People's
Co-operative Bank  Ltd., Parbhani  (Maharashtra)
In view of the fact that the The Parbhani People's  Co-operative Bank  Ltd., Parbhani,
Maharashtra, had ceased to be solvent, all efforts to revive it in close consultation with the
Government of Maharashtra had failed and the depositors were being inconvenienced by
continued uncertainty, the Reserve Bank of India delivered the order canceling its licence to the
bank on June 16, 2006. The Registrar of Co-operative Societies, Maharashtra has also been
requested to issue an order for winding up the bank and appoint a liquidator for the bank.  It
may be highlighted that on liquidation every depositor is entitled to repayment of his deposits up
to a monetary ceiling of Rs. 1,00,000/- from the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee
Corporation (DICGC) under usual terms and conditions.
The Reserve Bank of India decided to cancel the licence of The Parbhani People's Co-
operative Bank  Ltd., Parbhani, Maharashtra, as a final step after examining all the options for
revival of the bank and in order to protect the interest of the depositors. The inspection  of the
bank with reference  to its position  as on June 30,2002 indicated that its financial position was
precarious. However based on the bank's request it was given some time to show improvement.
In March 2005, the bank was affected  by heavy withdrawal of deposits resulting in a  severe
liquidity crisis.  The bank was, therefore, issued directions under Section 35A of the Banking
Regulation Act, 1949 (As applicable to Co-operative Societies) vide our order  dated April 20,
2005 imposing restriction on its activities. The subsequent inspection of the bank conducted
with reference to its financial as on March 31, 2005 revealed further deterioration in its financial
condition. Its deposits were getting eroded as the  realizable value of paid-up capital and
reserves was in the negative. The Reserve Bank had issued a notice to the bank on August 17,
2005 asking it to show cause as to why the licence granted to it to conduct banking business
should not be cancelled.  As the bank did not have a viable plan of action for its  revival and the
chances of its revival were remote, the Reserve Bank of India took the extreme measure of
canceling licence of the bank in the interest of the bank's depositors.  With the cancellation of its
licence and commencement of liquidation proceedings, the process of paying the depositors of
the The Parbhani People's Co-operative Bank Ltd., Parbhani, Maharashtra, will be set in motion
subject to the terms and conditions of the Deposit Insurance Scheme.
Consequent to the cancellation of its licence, the Parbhani People's Co-operative Bank
Ltd., Parbhani, Maharashtra is prohibited from carrying on ‘banking business’ as defined in
Section 5(b) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (AACS) including acceptance and repayment
of deposits.
