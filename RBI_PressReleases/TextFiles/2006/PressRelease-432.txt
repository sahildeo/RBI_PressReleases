International Investment Position (InIP) of India 
as at the end of March  2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006 
 
The International Investment Position (InIP), compiled at the end of a specific 
period such as end-March, is the statement of the stock of external financial assets 
and liabilities of a country. The financial assets consist of the country's financial 
claims on non-residents and financial liabilities consist of the country's financial 
liabilities to non-residents. These transactions are classified according to institutional 
resident sectors, namely, monetary authority, government, banks, and other sectors 
(includes corporate sector). The net international investment position (the stock of 
external assets less the stock of external liabilities) shows the difference between 
what an economy owns in relation to what it owes. The net InIP, combined with the 
stock of an economy’s non-financial assets, constitutes the net worth of that 
economy.  
As per the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) of the International 
Monetary Fund (IMF), data on InIP are to be disseminated on annual (quarterly 
encouraged) basis with a time lag of two quarters. The InIP of India is disseminated 
annually as at the end of March and the InIP of India as at the end of March 2005 
was last released in September 2005. The latest InIP as at the end of March 2006 is 
released now. Major highlights of International Investment Position of India are 
presented below. 
 
International Investment Position (InIP) of India  
as at end-March 2006 Major Highlights 
I. Over all Position 
(1) Net InIP is the stock of external assets less the stock of external liabilities. 
The net position has decreased by around US$ 6 billion during the year under 
review. This could be attributed to the widening of current account deficit from 
US$ 5.4 billion in 2004-05 to US$ 10.6 billion in 2005-06.

(2)  Reserve assets remained the most dominant component of the external 
assets. 
(3) Total reserve assets as on end-March 2006 exceeded the entire external debt 
(US $ 125.2 billion at the same reference period) by around US $ 26 billion. 
 
II. Ratios of External Assets and Liabilities to GDP (at current prices)  
 
(1) Reserve assets accounted for around 21 per cent of the country's GDP (at 
current prices). Consequently, external assets at the end of March 2006 
accounted for around 25.5 per cent of the country's GDP.  
(2) The ratio of total external liabilities to GDP remained between 31 per cent to 
33 per cent during the period under review.  
(3) Among the external liability components, the ratio of portfolio equity 
investment to GDP increased from 6.8 per cent at the end of March 2003 to 
8.8 at the end of March 2006. Further, while the ratio of direct investment to 
GDP has witnessed increasing trend in the last three years of the review 
period, the ratio of other investment to GDP has decreased gradually over the 
years under review.
