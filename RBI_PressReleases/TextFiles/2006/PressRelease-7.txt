Sources of Accretion to Foreign Exchange Reserves during April-November 2002. Subsequent to
this, the RBI has been regularly updating and releasing information on ‘Sources of Accretion to
Foreign Exchange Reserves’ through press releases which are available on the RBI website
(www.rbi.org.in).

These data have been released on RBI website (www.rbi.org.in) on December 29, 2006.

residual item of other capital transactions not included elsewhere) of US $ 3 billion.
Major sources of accretion to foreign exchange reserves during the first half of 2006-07
have been foreign investment, external commercial borrowing (ECB) and banking capital. The
accretion to the foreign exchange reserves was of the order of US $ 8.6 billion on BoP basis
(excluding valuation effects) during April-September 2006. Valuation gain, reflecting the
appreciation of major currencies against the US dollar, accounted for a rise of US $ 5.1 billion in
total reserves during the first half of 2006-07 as against a valuation loss of US $ 5.0 billion during
corresponding period previous year. Taking into account the valuation gain of US $ 5.1 billion,
foreign exchange reserves recorded an increase of US $ 13.7 billion during April-September 2006-
07 (an increase of US $ 1.5 billion during April-September 2005-06).
