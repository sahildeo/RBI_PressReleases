Global Developments
• According to the IMF’s World Economic Outlook, global real GDP growth in purchasing
power parity terms is expected to pick up from 4.9 per cent in 2005 to 5.1 per cent in 2006
before easing back to 4.9 per cent in 2007.
• In the US, real GDP growth was 1.6 per cent in the third quarter (July-September) as
compared with 5.6 per cent and 2.6 per cent in the first and second quarters, respectively.
• The strength of the global economy has been accompanied by upward pressure on
commodity prices till the first half of 2006.
• Following the re-pricing of risks in May-June, investor optimism seems to have returned
to most equity markets and, more significantly, to the emerging markets.
• A number of central banks have raised their policy rates, inter-alia, in the UK, Euro area,
Australia, China and Korea. Some central banks have put a pause on policy rates, notably
in the US, Canada, Japan, Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, Chile, Mexico and Turkey. A few
central banks have eased monetary policy, such as in Indonesia and Brazil.
Overall Assessment
• While global growth has been strong and broad-based, there are some indications of
moderation like the cooling of the US housing market and the potential drainage of liquidity
from financial markets. While global inflation conditions have not worsened, potential price
pressures persist in the wake of the firming up of food and metal prices, the uncertainty
surrounding international crude prices and the monetary overhang. While geopolitical risks
continue to cast a shadow, it is necessary to recognise that global risks have not changed
significantly from the time of the First Quarter Review of July, 2006.
• On the domestic front, there is a pick-up in the momentum of growth which also appears
to be spreading across all constituent sectors. Financial markets have exhibited stable and
orderly conditions. The current account deficit has been well-managed so far.
• There are indications of growing demand pressures and potential risks from rapid credit
growth, strains on credit quality and elevated asset prices. High levels of monetary
expansion and the evolution of the liquidity situation need to be continuously monitored for
any signs of risks to inflation.-5-
• At the current juncture, for policy purposes, the two major issues that exert conflicting
pulls are exploration of signs of overheating firming up to warrant a policy response, and,
the impact of lagged effects of earlier policy action on the evolution of macroeconomic
developments.
Stance of Monetary Policy
• The GDP growth is forecast to be at around 8.0 per cent during 2006-07 as against 7.5-
8.0 per cent projected in the Annual Policy Statement and the First Quarter Review.
• Containing the Y-o-Y inflation rate for 2006-07 in the range of 5.0-5.5 per cent assumes
policy priority in terms of watchful monitoring and appropriate policy responses.
• The growth in monetary and credit aggregates is expected to be higher than the initial
indicative projections. It is, however, important to reiterate the concerns expressed in the
First Quarter Review and take careful note of the higher expansion in money supply,
deposits and credit while assessing liquidity conditions.
• The increasing importance of global factors, by itself, would not warrant any change in
the policy stance at this stage, though the evolving monetary policy actions of major
economies need to be watched.
• In the domestic economy, there are signs of demand pressures in addition to possible
transient supply constraints in respect of primary commodities.
• The Reserve Bank will ensure that appropriate liquidity is maintained in the system so
that all legitimate requirements of credit are met, particularly for productive purposes,
consistent with the objective of price and financial stability. Towards this end, the Reserve
Bank will continue with its policy of active demand management of liquidity through open
market operations (OMO) including the MSS, LAF and CRR, and using all the policy
instruments at its disposal flexibly, as and when the situation warrants.
• Barring the emergence of any adverse and unexpected developments in various sectors
of the economy and keeping in view the current assessment of the economy including the
outlook for inflation, the overall stance of monetary policy in the period ahead will be:
• To ensure a monetary and interest rate environment that supports export and
investment demand in the economy so as to enable continuation of the growth
momentum while reinforcing price stability with a view to anchoring inflation
expectations.
• To maintain the emphasis on macroeconomic and, in particular, financial stability.
• To consider promptly all possible measures as appropriate to the evolving global and
domestic situation.
Monetary Measures
• Repo Rate under the LAF is increased by 25 basis points from 7.0 per cent to 7.25 per
cent with immediate effect.
• The Reserve Bank retains the option to conduct overnight repo or longer term repo
under the LAF depending on market conditions and other relevant factors. The Reserve
Bank will continue to use this flexibility including the right to accept or reject tender(s) under-6-
the LAF, wholly or partially, if deemed fit, so as to make efficient use of the LAF in daily
liquidity management.
• Reverse Repo Rate and Bank Rate have been kept unchanged at 6.0 per cent.
• CRR has been kept unchanged at 5.0 per cent.
