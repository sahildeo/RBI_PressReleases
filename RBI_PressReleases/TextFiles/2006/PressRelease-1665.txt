It may be noted that the Government of India had passed a resolution on
April 21, 2004 authorising the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) as the
‘Designated Agency’ to receive written complaints or disclosure on any allegation
of corruption or of misuse of office and recommend appropriate action. The
jurisdiction of the CVC in this regard is restricted to employees of the Central
Government or of any corporation established by it or under any Central Act,
Government companies, societies or local authorities owned or controlled by the
Central Government. All public sector banks and the Reserve Bank of India are
already covered by this resolution.
