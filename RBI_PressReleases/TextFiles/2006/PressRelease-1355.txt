Balance of Payments (BoP) Developments during Third Quarter
of 2005-06 (i.e., October-December 2005) and for
the period April-December 2005
The preliminary data compiled for the quarter October-December 2005, in conjunction
with the partially revised data for the first two quarters (i.e., April-June and July-September
2005), provide an assessment of the BoP for the period April-December 2005-06. Full details of
BoP data are set out in the enclosed Statements in the standard format of presentation.
October-December 2005
The major items of the BoP for Q3 of 2005-06 are presented in Table 1 below.

• India’s Merchandise exports, on a BoP basis, posted a robust growth (26.4 per cent) in
Q3, as compared with a year ago (18.7 per cent) on account of a more broad-based
export growth coupled with the normal seasonal upturn (Chart 1). Chart 1:Monthly Exports: April-December 2005

• Import payments showed moderation in Q3 (growth of 17.8 per cent) representing
mainly a strong base effect as imports grew by 55.4 per cent in the corresponding
quarter of 2004-05. However, excluding the impact of the base effect, import growth
would have been higher at around the trend growth rate of imports of above 20 per
cent.
• According to the data released by Directorate General of Commercial Intelligence and
Statistics (DGCI&S), while the oil import demand remained steady, non-oil imports
witnessed slowdown.
• Continued momentum in exports, coupled with a slowdown in import demand, led to a
trade deficit of US $12.0 billion in Q3 (US $ 11.7 billion in Q3 of 2004-05 and at around
US $ 15 billion in the first two quarters of the current financial year).
• Maintaining the pace of growth in travel earnings, business and professional services,
software services and remittances, invisible receipts rose by 31.3 per cent. The spurt in
remittances from overseas Indians, represented in private transfers, could be possibly
due to ploughing back of a part of the redemption proceeds of India Millennium
Deposits (IMDs).
• Invisible payments reflected continuing pace of outbound tourist traffic from India, rising
payments towards transportation, and higher investment income payments on account
of interest payments on maturing IMDs.
• An improvement in the invisible surplus (US $ 8.2 billion) in Q3 vis-à-vis the
corresponding quarter of 2004-05, despite persistent trade deficits, resulted in
considerable improvement in the current account deficit (US $ 3.9 billion) as compared
with the Q3 of 2004-05 (US $ 5.4 billion).
• Capital flows turned negative in the Q3 mainly due to repayment of IMDs (US $ 5.5
billion), moderation in FII inflows due to selling pressures in October-November 2005,
and buildup of foreign currency assets in the banks’ portfolios.  However, inflows in the
form of foreign direct investment (FDI) and NRI deposits remained steady. On the
whole, there was net outflow of US $ 0.6 billion as compared with a net inflow of US $
11.9 billion in Q3 of 2004-05.
• There was a drawdown of foreign exchange reserves in Q3 of 2005-06 of US $ 4.7
billion in contrast to an accretion of US $ 6.6 billion in Q3 of 2004-05. This order of
outflow was due to outgo of US $ 7.1 billion for redemption of IMDs (including interest
payments) on December 29, 2005.
April-December 2005
The BoP position for the first three quarters of 2005-06 has been worked out taking

• Maintaining a high export growth trajectory, merchandise exports, on BoP basis,
recorded a growth of 27.7 per cent during April-December 2005 (25.4 per cent in April-
December 2004). The commodity-wise break up, as per DGCI&S data revealed that
manufacturing exports led the growth momentum, with transport equipments,
machinery and parts, iron and steel, jems and jewellery, chemicals and petroleum
products emerging as the key drivers.
• Similarly, merchandise import payments maintained a tempo of high growth (36.9 per
cent) in April-December 2005.
• According to DGCI&S data, the rise in petroleum, oil and lubricants (POL) imports (47.1
per cent) in April-December 2005 showed the impact of hardening trend in international
crude oil prices as the volume growth in POL showed negligible growth. The imports of
crude petroleum products in volume terms increased marginally by 0.8 per cent in April-
November 2005 as compared with an increase of 10.5 per cent in April-November
2004. The average price of the Indian basket of international crude (a mix of Dubai and
Brent variety) rose to US $ 54.0 per barrel in April-December 2005 from US $ 37.3 per
barrel in April-December 2004 (Chart 2).

US $ Per Barrel• Non-oil import payments growth at 33.0 per cent continued to signify underlying
momentum, although moderated from a high growth phase of 2004-05 (40.4 per cent).
The key components of non-oil import were primarily the export related items and
capital goods which mirrored the growth in domestic industrial activity.
• According to DGCI&S data, import of gold and silver showed relatively moderate
growth. The gold and silver imports witnessed deceleration to 17.8 per cent in April-
November 2005 from 37.4 per cent a year ago as gold prices reached their 25-year
peak in December 2005.
• On BoP basis, the large import payments led to expansion in trade deficit to US $ 41.5
billion in April-December 2005 as compared with US $ 26.5 billion in April-December
2004 (Chart 3).

• While invisible receipts rose by 28.1 per cent, payments posted a growth of 22.1 per
cent, resulting in a higher invisible surplus of US $ 28.1 billion as compared with 20.6
billion in April-December 2004 (Table 3).

• The growth in invisible receipts was led mainly by significant expansion in
transportation, software exports, other professional and business services and
remittances from overseas Indians.
• Private transfers, comprising primarily remittances from Indians working overseas,
witnessed a sharp growth, particularly in Q3, which could be, as alluded to earlier,
attributed to the possibility of ploughing back of a part of maturity proceeds of IMDs
(Chart 4).

• While there was an increase in payments relating to investment income due to one-off
effect of IMD interest payments and payments on account of transportation services,
growth in outbound tourist traffic, payments for business services and technical
services witnessed moderation after scaling up in growth in 2004-05.
• A sharp rise in transportation services related payments (by US $ 1.6 billion) showed
the cumulative effect of rise in India’s volume of foreign trade and significant
acceleration in international shipping cargo freight rates due to high international crude
oil prices.

2005• Notwithstanding an increase of US $ 7.5 billion in invisible surplus, the large trade
deficit led to sharp increase in current account deficit to US $ 13.5 billion in April-
December 2005 from US$ 5.9 billion in April-December 2004 (Chart 5).

• A steady increase was recorded in most items of capital inflows, except for external
commercial borrowings (ECBs) and banking capital (Table 4).

• Net FDI inflows to India picked up on sustained interest in India as an attractive
investment destination due to strong economic activity and continued strength of the
corporate sector  with inflows channeling into manufacturing, business and computer
services. Outward FDI reflected some moderation.
• The FII inflows remained buoyant in April-December 2005, extending the phase of high
FII inflows continuing for the past two years. The resumption in FII inflows that began in
June 2005 continued through December 2005, except for some slack in October-
November 2005. The strong corporate earnings growth over the past several quarters
and expectations of continuance of high growth phase maintained FII interest in Indian
markets.
• ADR/GDR issuances remained buoyant as booming stock markets offered corporates
the opportunity to issue equities abroad.

2005• NRI deposits showed a significant turnaround from net outflows in the previous year. A
significant moderation, however, occurred in the net inflows under other components of
banking capital due to buildup of nostro balances by the banks.
• Despite firming up of international interest rates, the corporate sector’s demand for
external commercial borrowings remained strong, including FCCBs, in consonance with
the domestic industrial activity. Despite higher gross inflows of ECBs at US $ 8.9 billion
(US $ 5.7 billion in April-December 2004), net outflows were recorded due to one-off
effect of principal repayment of IMDs (US $ 5.5 billion).
• Recourse to short-term credit reflected rising import financing requirements.
• Other capital, which mainly represents leads and lags in export receipts, advance
payments, and funds held abroad – showed net outflow of US $ 0.4 billion  - correcting
the leads of the previous year (US $ 3.6 billion).
• Net accretion to foreign exchange reserves was US $ 1.8 billion (excluding valuation)
despite sizeable current account deficit and outflows due to redemption of IMDs (Chart
6).

• As there was valuation loss of US$ 6.1 billion in April-December 2005 due to cross
currency movements, the outstanding level of reserves witnessed a decline of US $ 4.3
billion.
• The outstanding foreign exchange reserves stood at US $ 137.2 billion at the end of
December 2005, placing India as the fifth largest holder of reserves among the
emerging markets and sixth largest in the world.
