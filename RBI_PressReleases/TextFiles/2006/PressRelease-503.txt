RBI to launch NDS-Call from September 18
A screen-based negotiated quote-driven system for all dealings in
call/notice and term money markets, NDS-Call, will be launched with effect from
September 18, 2006. The NDS Call system provides an electronic dealing platform
with features such as negotiation screen with display of amount, rate, tenor and
settlement type of borrowing and lending quotes, preferred counterparty and
exposure limit set up at the choice of participants, and monitoring of adherence to
regulatory limits. The system is expected to improve the ease of transactions and
resolve problems associated with asymmetry of information in this important
market.
Though membership of the NDS-Call system is open to all market
participants, dealing on this platform is optional. The system is expected to bring
about greater transparency and more efficient price discovery in the market.
It may be recalled that the conception of such a system was announced in
the Annual Policy Statement for the year 2005-06 and its launching was
anticipated in the Annual Policy Statement for the year 2006-2007. The system
has been developed by Clearing Corporation of India Ltd on behalf of the Reserve
Bank of India,
