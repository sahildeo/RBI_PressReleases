RBI announces Draft Scheme of
Amalgamation of UWB with Industrial Development Bank of India Limited
The Reserve Bank of India has today placed in public domain a draft
scheme of amalgamation of the United Western Bank Ltd. (UWB) with the
Industrial Development Bank of India Limited.  The draft scheme has also been
sent to both the banks. The Reserve Bank has invited suggestions and
objections on the draft scheme from the members of public, including the banks'
shareholders, depositors and creditors.  Both the banks have been given two
weeks’ time up to Wednesday, September 27, 2006, to consider the draft
scheme.  The suggestions and objections should be sent to the Chief General
Manager-in-charge, Department of Banking Operations and Development,
Reserve Bank of India, Central Office, Central Office Building, 12th Floor, Shahid
Bhagat Singh Road, Fort, Mumbai – 400 001 by the close of business on
Wednesday, September 27, 2006.  The Reserve Bank will take a view on the
future set up of UWB soon thereafter.  
It may be recalled that the United Western Bank Ltd. (UWB) has been
placed under an order of moratorium on September 2, 2006.  The order is
effective up to December 1, 2006 or an earlier date if alternate arrangements are
in place.  The Reserve Bank was to decide the future set up of the UWB during
the period of the moratorium.
The Reserve Bank received expression of interest from 17 entities for
taking over/restructuring UWB.  The only restructuring proposal was from UWB,
which envisaged help of the Government of Maharashtra and other investors.
These proposals have been examined keeping in view protection of the
depositors' interest, expeditious resolution and avoidance of regulatory
forbearance. The interest of employees and shareholders of UWB were also kept
in mind.
