Reserve Bank Cancels the Licence of
Bangalore Mercantile Co-operative Bank Ltd., Bangalore
In view of the fact that the Bangalore Mercantile Co-operative Bank Ltd.,
Bangalore, (Karnataka) had ceased to be solvent, all efforts to revive it in close
consultation with the Government of Karnataka had failed and the depositors of the
bank were being inconvenienced by continued uncertainty, the Reserve Bank of
India delivered the order, canceling its licence to the bank after the close of business
on June 23, 2006. The Registrar of Co-operative Societies, Karnataka has also been
requested to issue an order for winding up of the bank and appoint a Liquidator for
the bank. It may be highlighted that on liquidation every depositor is entitled to
repayment of his deposits up to a monetary ceiling of Rs.1,00,000/- from the Deposit
Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC).
The bank was granted a licence by Reserve Bank on October 08, 1998 to
commence banking business. In response to the complaints lodged by certain
members against the management of the bank, a special scrutiny of the books of
accounts of the bank was conducted in August 2000. It was observed that the Board
of Directors had flouted the norms/practices, which are usually observed while
conducting banking business and had also violated guidelines/directives/exposure
norms, etc. issued by the Reserve Bank. Hence, in public interest and in the interest
of the depositors, the Board of Directors was superseded and an Administrator was
appointed by RCS, Karnataka to take care of the affairs of the bank.
The statutory inspection of the bank, carried out under Section 35 of the Act,
with reference to its financial position as on September 30, 2000 revealed that the
bank's financial position had deteriorated and in order to protect the interest of the
depositors, the bank was placed under directions issued under Section 35A of the
Act with effect from the close of business on October 08, 2001.
A subsequent statutory inspection with reference to the bank's position as on
June 30, 2003 revealed further deterioration in the financial position of the bank. The
Reserve Bank issued a notice to the bank on February 17, 2004 asking it to show
cause as to why the licence granted to it to conduct banking business should not be
cancelled. In its reply, while the bank admitted all the irregularities/deficiencies
pointed out in the notice, it expressed a desire to convert itself into a non-banking
entity and register as a Co-operative credit society and thereby to go outside the
purview of the Act. The bank was then advised to take necessary steps in this
regard.
The last statutory inspection of the bank with reference to its financial position
as on December 31, 2004 revealed that the financial position had become more
precarious. The bank failed to show any improvement in its financial position as
promised in its reply to the Show Cause Notice. The net worth continued to be
negative and the deposits had eroded to the extent of 81.2% of total deposits.  The
bank had also not taken any steps to convert itself into a co-operative society.2
Hence, after issuing a fresh notice dated June 24, 2005 and taking into
consideration the reply submitted by the bank and after examining all options for its
revival, the Reserve Bank of India took the extreme measure of canceling licence of
the bank in the interest of the bank's depositors.  With the cancellation of its licence
and commencement of liquidation proceedings, the process of paying the depositors
of the Bangalore Mercantile Co-operative Bank Ltd., the amount insured as per the
DICGC Act will be set in motion.
Consequent to the cancellation of its licence, the Bangalore Mercantile Co-
operative Bank Ltd., is prohibited from carrying on 'banking business' as defined in
Section 5(b) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949(AACS) including acceptance and
repayment of deposits.
