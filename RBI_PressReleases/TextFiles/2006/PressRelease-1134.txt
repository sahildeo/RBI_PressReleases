Reserve Bank Cancels the Licence of
The Onake Obavva Mahila Co-operative Bank Ltd., Chitradurga (Karnataka)
In view of the fact that the The Onake Obavva Mahila Co-operative Bank Ltd.,
Chitradurga (Karnataka) had ceased to be solvent, all efforts to revive it in close
consultation with the Government of Karnataka had failed and the depositors of the bank
were being inconvenienced by continued uncertainty, the Reserve Bank of India delivered
the order, canceling its licence to the bank after the close of business on May 12, 2006.
The Registrar of Co-operative Societies, Karnataka has also been requested to issue an
order for winding up of the bank and appoint a Liquidator for the bank. It may be
highlighted that on liquidation every depositor is entitled to repayment of his deposits up to
a monetary ceiling of Rs.1,00,000/- from the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee
Corporation (DICGC).
The scrutiny of the books of accounts of the bank conducted by Reserve Bank with
reference to its position as on March 31, 2003 revealed that the bank was facing severe
liquidity crunch. The realizable value of capital and reserves was in the negative and the
deposits were eroded to the extent of 27.82% of the total deposits. Considering its
unsatisfactory financial position the bank was placed under directions under Section 35A
of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (As Applicable to Co-operative Societies) with effect
from the close of business on September 11, 2003 which inter-alia restricted withdrawal of
deposits to Rs. 1000 per depositor. The inspection of the bank with reference to its
financial position as on June 30, 2004 revealed further deterioration in the realizable value
of capital and reserves leading to erosion of deposits to the extent of 39.5% of its total
deposits. The Reserve Bank issued a notice to the bank on January 12, 2005 asking it to
show cause as to why the licence granted to it to conduct banking business should not be
cancelled. In reply to the Show Cause Notice the bank requested for six months time to
show perceptible improvement, which was granted. The subsequent inspection of the bank
with reference to its position as on March 31, 2005 revealed further deterioration in its
financial condition. Its deposits were eroded to the extent of 62.9% of total deposits. As the
realizable value of bank's paid-up capital and reserves was negative and the chances of its
revival were remote in the absence of a viable action plan, the Reserve Bank of India took
the extreme measure of canceling licence of the bank after examining all options for its
revival, in the interest of the bank's depositors. With the cancellation of its licence and
commencement of liquidation proceedings, the process of paying the depositors of The
Onake Obavva Mahila Co-operative Bank Ltd., the amount insured as per the DICGC Act
will be set in motion.
Consequent to the cancellation of its licence, the The Onake Obavva Mahila Co-
operative Bank Ltd., is prohibited from carrying on 'banking business' as defined in Section
5(b) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949(AACS) including acceptance and repayment of
deposits.
