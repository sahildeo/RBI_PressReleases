f. Other items in capital account -0.1 3.4
III. Valuation change -6.1 4.7
Total (I+II+III) -4.3 18.2
Major sources of accretion to foreign exchange reserves during April-December 2005 have been
foreign investment, banking capital and short-term credit. On account of redemption of India Millennium
Deposits (IMDs), the net external commercial borrowings are negative during this period. The accretion to
the foreign exchange reserves was of the order of US $ 1.8 billion on a BoP basis (excluding valuation
effects) during April-December 2005. Valuation loss, reflecting the depreciation of major currencies
against the US dollar, accounted for a decline of US $ 6.1 billion in total reserves during April-December
2005 as against a valuation gain of US $ 4.7 billion in April-December 2004. Taking into account thevaluation loss of US $ 6.1 billion, foreign exchange reserves recorded a decrease of US $ 4.3 billion
during April-December 2005 (an increase of US $ 18.2 billion during April-December 2004).
