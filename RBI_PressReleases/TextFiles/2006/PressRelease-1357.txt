RBI to conduct Additional LAF on March 31, 2006
At the request of the market participants, the Reserve Bank of India would
conduct an additional Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) on March 31, 2006. The
bids for this auction would be received between 9.00 p.m. to 9.30 p.m. on that
day.
It may be noted that as in the past, on March 31, banking hours for
government business, including receipts of tax have been extended. The
additional LAF has been put in place to facilitate funds management by banks on
account of the year-end closing on March 31, 2006 falling on a reporting Friday.
The features of the additional LAF would remain the same as those of the LAF
and SLAF in all its operational aspects. The settlement will be conducted
separately and on gross basis.
At present, the Reserve Bank of India operates Liquidity Adjustment
Facility (LAF) to inject/absorb liquidity through daily repos/reverse repos auctions
twice a day - in the forenoon between 9.30 a.m. and 10.30 a.m and in the
evening between 3.00 p.m. and 3.45 p.m.
