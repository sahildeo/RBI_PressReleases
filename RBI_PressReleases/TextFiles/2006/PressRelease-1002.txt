RBI Departments receive ISO 9001-2000 Certification
The Reserve Bank of India has received ISO 9001-2000 Certification for two of
its important departments, namely, currency management and banking.

internationally accepted framework for establishing quality management systems with
customer focus as the key element. These standards also provide for an inbuilt
mechanism for effecting continual improvements in the system. Certification under
these standards demonstrates that the management system of the organisation
conforms to the specified requirements, is capable of consistently achieving the stated
service policy and ensuring its effective implementation.
 Conformity to the standards for ISO 9001-2000 was assessed by ICSE (Asia)

New Zealand).
During the assessment for certification by ICSE(Asia) Pvt. Ltd., the quality policy,
citizens' charter and service of the Reserve Bank were evaluated and found to provide
a safe and adequate framework for establishing and reviewing quality service
objectives including customer expectations and complaints. Seeking ISO certification
for its processes was a  part of the Reserve Bank's continuing initiatives to adopt and
adhere to international best practices and standards.
The currency management function of the Reserve Bank involves issue and
exchange of currency notes and coins with  the objective of giving the public adequate
supply of currency notes and coins in good quality. Under the banking function, the
Reserve Bank maintains banking accounts of the central and the state governments
and of all scheduled banks.

banking functions at Kolkata and Hyderabad Regional Offices of the Reserve Bank.
The Reserve Bank has further decided to obtain ISO 9001-2000 certification for its
currency management and banking functions at Bangalore, Chennai, Jaipur and New
Delhi Offices in the next phase.
