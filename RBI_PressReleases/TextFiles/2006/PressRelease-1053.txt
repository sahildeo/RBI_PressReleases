Reserve Bank Cancels the Licence of The Ichalkaranji Jiveshwar
Sahakari  Bank Ltd., Ichalkaranji
In view of the fact that the Ichalkaranji Jiveshwar Sahakari Bank Ltd.,
Ichalkaranji, Dist., Kolhapur, Maharashtra, had ceased to be solvent, all efforts to revive
it in close consultation with the Government of Maharashtra had failed and the
depositors were being inconvenienced by continued uncertainty, the Reserve Bank of
India delivered the order cancelling its licence to the bank on May 30, 2006. The
Registrar of Co-operative Societies, Maharashtra has also been requested to issue an
order for winding up the bank and appoint a liquidator for the bank.  It may be
highlighted that on liquidation every depositor is entitled to repayment of his deposits up
to a monetary ceiling of Rs. 1,00,000/- from the Deposit Insurance and Credit
Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) under usual terms and conditions.
The Reserve Bank of India decided to cancel the licence of the Ichalkaranji
Jiveshwar Sahakari Bank Ltd., Ichalkaranji, Dist., Kolhapur, Maharashtra, as a final step
after examining all the options for revival of the bank and in order to protect the interests
of the depositors.  The inspection of the bank with reference to its financial position as
on March 31,, 2003 revealed that the bank's financial position was unsatisfactory. The
bank was, therefore, issued directions under Section 35A of the Banking Regulation
Act, 1949 (As applicable to Co-operative Societies) with effect from the close of
business of May 14, 2003 including a cap of Rs 1000/- on withdrawal of deposits by an
individual depositor. On the basis of the RBI's requisition dated September 20, 2003 the
Board of Directors of the bank was superseded on September 26, 2003 for
mismanagement of the bank's affairs. The subsequent inspection of the bank conducted
with reference to its position as on March 31, 2005 revealed further deterioration in its
financial condition. Its deposits were getting eroded as realizable value of paid-up
capital and reserves was in the negative. The Reserve Bank had issued a notice to the
bank on September 02, 2005 asking it to show cause as to why the licence granted to it
to conduct banking business should not be cancelled.  As the bank did not have a viable
plan of action for its revival and the chances of its revival were remote, the Reserve
Bank of India took the extreme measure of cancelling licence of the bank in the interests
of the bank's depositors.  With the cancellation of its licence and commencement of
liquidation proceedings, the process of paying the depositors of the Ichalkaranji
Jiveshwar Sahakari Bank Ltd., Ichalkarani, Dist., Kolhapur, Maharashtra, the amount
insured as per the DICGC Act, will be set in motion.
Consequent to the cancellation of its licence, the Ichalkaranji Jiveshwar Sahakari
Bank Ltd., Ichalkarani, Dist., Kolhapur, Maharashtra is prohibited from carrying on
‘banking business’ as defined in Section 5(b) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949
(AACS) including acceptance and repayment of deposits.For any clarifications, depositors may approach Shri S.Sen, General Manager-in-
