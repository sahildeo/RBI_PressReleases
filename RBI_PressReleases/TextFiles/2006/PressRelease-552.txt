Government of Rajasthan signs

The Government of Rajasthan and the Reserve Bank of India have today, on
September 6, 2006, signed a Memorandum of Understanding with regard to urban co-
operative banks in the state of Rajasthan. Consequent upon this, a State Level Task
Force on Urban Co-operative Banks (TAFCUB) has been constituted for Rajasthan.
Shri B.P. Vijayendra, Regional Director of the Reserve Bank for the State of Rajasthan
is the Chairman of the TAFCUB and Shri Sudhansh Pant, Registrar, Co-operative
Societies, Rajasthan is its co-chairman. The other members of the TAFCUB are: Dy.
Secretary, Co-operation from the State Government of Rajasthan, Shri Sathyan David,
General Manager, Urban Banks Department, Reserve Bank of India, as representative
of Central Office, Mumbai, a representative from the National Federation of Urban Co-
operative Banks (NAFCUB), New Delhi and Shri Mukesh Modi representing the State
Urban Banks Federation. The first meeting of the TAFCUB will be held soon.
Similar MOUs have also been signed with the States of Andhra Pradesh,
Gujarat, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh and Uttaranchal.
As part of its developmental role, the Reserve Bank would also be assessing the
training, computerisation needs of the urban co-operative banks in the State of
Rajasthan with the objective of upgrading their human resource skills and technological
infrastructure so that they improve their operational efficiency and quality of
management information systems.
It may be recalled that in the Mid-term Review of Annual Policy announced in
October 2004, the Reserve Bank had announced that a vision document for urban co-
operative banks would be prepared. Accordingly, the Reserve Bank placed in public
domain a draft vision document in March 2005. As the urban co-operative banks are
subject to dual control by the Reserve Bank and State Governments, the vision
document envisaged the signing of Memorandum of Understanding between the State
Governments and the Reserve Bank of India to put in place an arrangement through
which there is a convergence on the approach and remedial actions required to be
taken for facilitating the development of the sector. The vision document also proposed
the constitution of a State Level Task Force of Urban Co-operative Banks, under the
chairmanship of Regional Director of the Reserve Bank for the concerned State with
Registrar of Co-operative Societies as the co- chairman and representatives from the
State and the National Federation of Urban Co-operative Banks (NAFCUB) among
others, as its members, for the purpose of identifying the potentially viable urban co-
operative banks and drawing up a time bound action plan for their revival by setting
specific monitorable milestones.
