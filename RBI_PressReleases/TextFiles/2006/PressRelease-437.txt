India’s External Debt as at the end of June 2006
• India’s external debt at end-June 2006 increased by about US $ 6.9 billion
over the end-March 2006 level to reach a level of US $ 132.1 billion (Chart 1).
• All the components of external debt except rupee debt have risen during the
quarter (Table 1, Chart 2).
• Among the components of external debt, external commercial borrowings
(ECBs) recorded the largest increase (US $ 5.4 billion) during the quarter
(Table 1), reflecting strong domestic investment activity. The increase is also
partly attributed to the decline in the stock of ECBs at end-March 2006. While
gross disbursements under ECBs were high during 2005-06, net
disbursements had remained low on account of principal repayment of India
Millennium Deposits (IMDs). Under ECB, commercial bank loans and foreign
currency convertible bonds (FCCBs) account for the major increase during
this quarter.

• The share of concessional debt in total external debt declined to 30.2 per cent
at end-June 2006 from 31.5 per cent at end-March 2006. It may be recalled
that this ratio was around 45.9 per cent at end-March 1991. This development
indicates a gradual increase in non-concessional private debt in India's
external debt stock.
• India’s foreign exchange reserves exceeded the external debt by US $ 30.8
billion providing a cover of 123.3 per cent to the external debt stock at the end
of June 2006 (Chart 4).4
