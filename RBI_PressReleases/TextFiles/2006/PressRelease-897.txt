Major sources of accretion to foreign exchange reserves during the year 2005-06
have been foreign investment, short-term credit and External Commercial Borrowing(ECB). The accretion to the foreign exchange reserves was of the order of US $ 15.1
billion on a BoP basis (excluding valuation effects) during 2005-06. Valuation loss,
reflecting the depreciation of major currencies against the US dollar, accounted for a
decline of US $ 5.0 billion in total reserves during 2005-06 as against a valuation gain of
US $ 2.4 billion during 2004-05. Taking into account the valuation loss of US $ 5.0
billion, foreign exchange reserves recorded an increase of US $ 10.1 billion during
2005-06 (an increase of US $ 28.6 billion during 2004-05).
