RBI releases Draft Guidelines on Fair Practices Code for NBFCs
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has today posted the draft Guidelines on Fair
Practices Code for Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) on its web-site.
Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) which are a part of the financial
system contribute to the economic growth by increasing the outreach of credit delivery
mechanism. To provide for transparency in transactions between the institutions and
the end users and also to provide for well informed business relationship some broad
guidelines were considered necessary.  The Reserve Bank of India, in this backdrop,
has framed the said draft guidelines on Fair Practices Code to serve as a part of best
corporate practices. This will go a long way in providing transparency in business
practices.
To adopt a consultative approach, the said guidelines have been placed on the
Reserve Bank of India's website (www.rbi.org.in) for study by a wider audience.
Comments/suggestions may please be sent to ccmitra@rbi.org.in  or
pratapahuja@rbi.org.in at the earliest but not later than June 9, 2006 for consideration
of the Bank.
