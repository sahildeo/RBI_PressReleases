Reserve Bank Cancels the Licence of
The Karamsad Urban  Co-operative Bank Ltd., Karamsad (Gujarat)
In view of the fact that the Karamsad Urban Co-operative Bank Ltd., Karamsad Gujarat,
had ceased to be solvent, all efforts to revive it in close consultation with the Government of
Gujarat had failed and the depositors were being inconvenienced by continued uncertainty, the
Reserve Bank of India delivered the order cancelling its licence to the bank on December 09,
2006. The Registrar of Co-operative Societies, Gujarat has also been requested to issue an
order for winding up the bank and appoint a liquidator for the bank.  It may be highlighted that
on liquidation every depositor is entitled to repayment of his deposits up to a monetary ceiling of
Rs. 1,00,000/- from the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) under
usual terms and conditions.
The Reserve Bank of India decided to cancel the licence of the Karamsad Urban Co-
operative Bank Ltd., Karamsad, Gujarat as a final step after examining all the options for revival
of the bank and in order to protect the interest of the depositors.
On account of a liquidity crunch, the bank was not able to refund the amount of matured
FDs.  It was, therefore, issued directions under Section 35A of the Banking Regulation Act,
1949 (As applicable to Co-operative Societies) vide RBI directive dated February 03, 2003
including a cap of Rs 2000/- on withdrawal of deposits by an individual depositor. The inspection
of the bank conducted with reference to its position as on March 31, 2006 revealed further
deterioration in its financial condition. Its deposits were getting eroded as realizable value of
paid-up capital and reserve was in the negative.
The Reserve Bank had issued a notice to the bank on September 28, 2006 asking it to
show cause as to why the licence granted to it to conduct banking business should not be
cancelled.   As the bank did not have a viable plan of action for its revival and the chances of its
revival were remote, the Reserve Bank of India took the extreme measure of cancelling licence
of the bank in the interest of the bank's depositors.  With the cancellation of its licence and
commencement of liquidation proceedings, the process of paying the depositors of the
Karamsad Urban Co-operative Bank Ltd., Karamsad will be set in motion subject to the terms
and conditions of the Deposit Insurance Scheme.
Consequent to the cancellation of its licence, Karamsad Urban Co-operative Bank Ltd.,
Karamsad is prohibited from carrying on ‘banking business’ as defined in Section 5(b) of the
Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (AACS) including acceptance and repayment of deposits.
