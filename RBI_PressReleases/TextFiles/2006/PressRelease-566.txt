United Western Bank Ltd. Placed under Moratorium
On an application by the Reserve Bank of India, the Central Government
has today issued an Order of Moratorium in respect of the United Western Bank
Ltd. The Order of Moratorium has been passed by the Central Government in
public interest, in the interest of depositors and the banking system.
The moratorium will be effective from 14.00 hrs. on Saturday, September 2,
2006 up to and inclusive of December 1, 2006 or an earlier date, if alternate
arrangements are put in place. During this period, the Reserve Bank of India will
consider various options, including amalgamation of United Western Bank Ltd. with
any other bank and finalise the plans in public interest and with a view to ensuring
that the public deposits are protected.
During the period of moratorium, the bank will be permitted to make only
those payments that have been specified in the Order of Moratorium and the
depositors of the United Western Bank Ltd. will be permitted to withdraw, in total,
up to Rs.10,000 (Rs. ten thousand only) from their savings bank account or current
account or any other deposit account through any of the branches of the bank. For
the present, customers of the bank will not be able to withdraw money through the
ATMs of the bank/ATMs shared with other banks so as to give effect to the
monetary ceiling prescribed in the moratorium. The customers, however, will be
able to withdraw money up to Rs. 10,000, that is, the limit specified, at any of the
bank’s branches.
Established in 1936, The United Western Bank Ltd., has its headquarters at
Satara, Maharashtra. The bank has a network of 230 branches, 12 Extension
Counters and 75 ATMs and its operations are mainly concentrated in
Maharashatra. It is listed on Bombay Stock Exchange. As on March 31, 2006, the
bank’s deposits were at Rs. 6480.19 crore and advances were Rs. 4006.27 crore.
The bank incurred net losses of Rs. 98.64 crore and Rs. 106.48 crore during the
years 2004-05 and 2005-06, respectively. Its net non-performing assets were
5.66% as on March 31, 2006 as compared to the peer group figure of 1.97%.  The
bank's assessed Capital to Risk Weighted Asset Ratio (CRAR) turned negative at
(-) 0.3% as on June 30, 2006. This has jeopardised depositors’ interest. The bank
was also unable to come up with any credible plan to raise fresh capital to bring its
CRAR to the prescribed level.
