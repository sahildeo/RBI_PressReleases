upgrading their human resources skills and technological infrastructure so that they improve their 
operational efficiency and quality of management information systems.

required to be taken for facilitating the development of the sector. The State Level Task Force for Urban 
Co-operative Banks which is constituted with representatives of State Government, State/National 
Federation of Urban Cooperative Banks and the Reserve Bank of India as its members, identifies the
