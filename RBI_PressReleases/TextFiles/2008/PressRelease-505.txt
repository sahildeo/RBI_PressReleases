October 15, 2008  
 
RBI announces further measures for improving 
domestic and foreign currency liquidity   
  
  
            The Reserve Bank of India has been continuously monitoring the liquidity and monetary 
conditions in the recent period.  A host of measures have already been taken over the last one 
month to ensure that there is adequate liquidity in the system.     
  
The Indian interbank unsecured money market has been functioning normally.  Average 
daily volumes in the overnight call money market, at about Rs.14,000 crore in October 2008 
have in fact been somewhat higher than those observed in the previous six month period.  
However, the continuing uncertain global situation is having an indirect impact on our financial 
markets.  On a further review, the RBI has decided to institute the following measures:     
 
(i)  The cash reserve ratio (CRR) of scheduled banks is currently at 7.5 per cent of their net 
demand and time liabilities (NDTL).  On a review of the evolving liquidity situation, it has been 
decided to reduce the CRR by 100 basis points to 6.5 per cent of NDTL with effect from the 
current reporting fortnight that began on October 11, 2008.  This measure will release additional 
liquidity into the system of the order of Rs.40,000 crore.  
 
(ii) On Tuesday, October 14, 2008, the RBI decided to conduct  a special  14  day  Repo at 9 
per cent per annum for a notified amount of Rs.20,000 crore with a view to enabling banks to 
meet the liquidity requirements of mutual funds.  Rs.3,500 crore of this facility was utilised by 
banks yesterday.  Further, the Reserve Bank announced this morning  that this 14 day repo 
facility will now be conducted every day until further notice upto a cumulative amount of  
Rs.20,000 crore for the same purpose.  Banks obtain liquidity from the Reserve Bank under the 
Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) against the collateral of eligible securities that are in excess 
of their prescribed Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR). It has been decided,  purely as a temporary 
measure, that banks may avail of additional liquidity support exclusively for the purpose of 
meeting the liquidity requirements of mutual funds to the extent of up to 0.5 per cent of their NDTL.  This additional liquidity support will terminate 14 days from the closure of this special 
term repo facility announced on October 14, 2008.  This accommodation will be in addition to 
the temporary measure announced on September 16, 2008 permitting banks to avail of 
additional liquidity support to the extent of up to 1 per cent of their NDTL.     
  
(iii) RBI instituted a mechanism of Special Market Operations (SMO) for public sector oil 
marketing companies in June-July 2008 taking into account the extraordinary situation then 
prevailing in the money and forex markets.  RBI will institute  a similar facility when oil bonds 
become available.   
  
(iv)   Under the Agricultural Debt Waiver and Debt Relief Scheme Government    had agreed to 
provide to commercial banks, RRBs and co-operative credit institutions a sum of Rs.25,000 
crore as the first instalment.  At the request of the Government, RBI has agreed to provide the 
sum to the lending institutions immediately.  This liquidity support will be provided by the 
Reserve Bank of India under Section 17(3-B) and Section 17(4E) of  RBI Act to scheduled  
banks and NABARD respectively.           
  
(v) Interest Rates on NRI Deposits 
 (a) Interest Rates on FCNR (B) Deposits       
Currently, the interest rate ceiling on FCNR(B) deposits of all maturities has been fixed at 
Libor/Swap rates for the corresponding maturities minus 25 basis points for the respective 
foreign currencies.  In view of the prevailing market conditions, it has been decided:  
 
•  to increase, with immediate effect, the interest rate ceiling on FCNR (B) deposits 
by 50 basis points, i.e., to Libor/Swap rates plus 25 basis points.       
  
(b)  Interest Rate on NR(E) RA Deposits  
Currently, the interest rate ceiling on NR(E) RA for one to three years maturity should not 
exceed the Libor/Swap rates plus 50 basis points for US dollar of corresponding maturity.  In 
view of the prevailing market conditions, it has been decided:    
 
•  to increase, with immediate effect, the interest rate ceiling on NR(E)RA              
deposits by 50 basis points, i.e., to Libor/Swap rates plus 100 basis points.        
(vi)   Banks will be allowed to borrow funds from their overseas branches and correspondent 
banks up to a limit of 50 per cent of their unimpaired Tier I capital as at the close of the previous 
quarter or USD 10 million, whichever is higher, as against the existing limit of 25 per cent.     
 
The above measures will be reviewed on a continuous basis in the light of the evolving 
liquidity conditions.   
    
The Reserve Bank is monitoring developments in the financial markets closely and 
continuously and would respond swiftly and even pre-emptively to any adverse external 
developments impinging on domestic financial stability, price stability and inflation expectations. 
The Reserve Bank is committed to maintaining financial stability and active, and flexible liquidity 
management using all policy instruments is an integral part of this objective.
