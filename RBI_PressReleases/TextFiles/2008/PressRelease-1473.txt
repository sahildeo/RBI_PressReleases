The International Investment Position (IIP), compiled at the end of a specific period such as end-
March, is the statement of the stock of external financial assets and liabilities of a country. The financial 
assets consist of the country's financial claims on non-residents and financial liabilities consist of the 
country's financial liabilities to non-residents. These transactions are classified according to institutional 
resident sectors, namely, monetary authority, government, banks, and other sectors including corporate 
sector. The net international investment position (the stock of external financial assets less the stock of 
external financial liabilities) shows the difference between what an economy owns in relation to what it owes.  
 
As per the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), 
data on IIP are to be disseminated on annual basis (quarterly encouraged) with a time lag of two quarters. In 
India, since the quarter end-June 2006, the IIP is being disseminated on quarterly basis with a lag of less 
than two quarters.  The quarterly IIP as at end-June 2007 was released on RBI website on December 31, 
2007. 
 
The IIP series have been revised from March 2005 due to inclusion of suppliers credit of less than 
180 days and Foreign Institutional Investors' (FIIs) investment in short term debt instruments under short term 
debt; and non-resident ordinary (NRO) deposits from quarter ending June 2005 under non-resident Indian 
(NRI) deposits.
