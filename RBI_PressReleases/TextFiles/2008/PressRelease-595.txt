National Electronic Clearing Service inaugurated 
 
Shri V.Leeladhar, Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India today inaugurated the 
National Electronic Clearing Service (NECS) at a function at the Reserve Bank's 
National Clearing Centre (NCC), Mumbai. 
 
The service aims to centralise the Electronic Clearing Service (ECS) operation and bring 
in uniformity and efficiency to the system. ECS was introduced in the early nineties and 
is operational at 74 locations at present, facilitating easy payments and collections for 
repetitive and bulk transactions.  On an average around 20 million ECS transactions are 
processed each month. Presently, ECS system functions in a decentralised manner 
requiring users to prepare separate set of ECS data centre-wise. Users are required to 
have tie-up with local sponsor banks for presenting ECS file to each ECS Centre.  
 
NECS (Credit) would facilitate multiple credits to beneficiary accounts destination branch 
at participating centre against a single debit of the account of a user with the sponsor 
bank. NECS (Debit) would facilitate multiple debits to destination account holders 
against single credit to user account. The system has a pan-India characteristic 
leveraging on Core Banking Solutions (CBS) of member banks. This would facilitate all 
CBS bank branches to participate in the system, irrespective of their locations. 
 
In the new set-up, users have to prepare one consolidated NECS file and submit it 
centrally to the NCC, Nariman Point, Mumbai, through their sponsor banks. The sponsor 
banks would make use of the web-server provided for the purpose. The web-server also 
has the facility to get on-line data validation so that error free data could be uploaded for 
processing. The files can be uploaded up to the cut-off time one day prior to the 
settlement day by sponsor banks thus bringing down further the lead time required for 
processing. The returns also would get processed on the settlement day itself thus on 
the third day the users would have the status of the transactions. 
 
As on date 25,000 branches of 50 banks are participating in NECS operations and other 
banks are expected to join in course of time.  
 
In first phase, it is proposed to introduce the NECS (Credit). The NECS (Debit) would be 
introduced subsequently, based on the experience and feedback received from member 
banks.
