RBI places on its site Report on Suggesting a Framework  
for Electronic Benefit Transfer for Public Comments   
 
The Reserve Bank of India has today placed on its website the report of the 
Committee for suggesting a framework for Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) for public 
comments. Comments may be sent either by post to the Chief General Manager, 
Reserve Bank of India, Department of Payment and Settlement Systems, Central 
Office, Fort, Mumbai - 400 001 or sent by Fax at no. 022- 22659566 or may be emailed   
on or before May 16, 2008.  
 
The Committee has, in its report, made recommendations on the implementation 
possibilities of EBT. The underlying theme of the recommendation is to have a broader 
methodology to ensure that Government payments reach the ultimate beneficiaries 
using the banking channels, adopting the plan of financial inclusion using BCs and 
biometric based smart-card technology. The Committee has also suggested a 
framework for monitoring the progress in implementation. 
 
Of late, a number of State Governments have introduced social welfare 
programmes which involve payment to the beneficiaries. Payments are made either 
through Government offices or through banks or other means like money orders. The 
Reserve Bank of India has also taken certain initiatives to enlarge the reach of banking 
facilities to sectors neglected so far through its financial inclusion initiatives in the form 
of permitting banks to engage Business Correspondents (BC). Coupled with this, the 
need to channelise the financial benefits extended by Governments, both central and 
the states, to the weaker and needy sections of the society, to the ultimate beneficiaries 
using the banking system was also identified. In this background, a Committee was 
appointed for analysing the relative issues and suggesting an appropriate workable 
framework for Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) system that can be considered for 
adoption by all State Governments.
