RBI increases Repo Rate 
The Annual Policy Statement for the year 2008-09 (April 29, 2008) had stated, 
inter alia, that the overall stance of monetary policy in 2008-09 will broadly be to 
ensure a monetary and interest rate environment that accords high priority to price 
stability, well-anchored inflation expectations and orderly conditions in financial 
markets while being conducive to continuation of the growth momentum. Further, it 
was proposed to respond swiftly on a continuing basis to the evolving constellation of 
adverse international developments and to the domestic situation impinging on 
inflation expectations, financial stability and growth momentum, with both conventional 
and unconventional measures, as appropriate. 
The year-on-year WPI inflation which was 4.36 per cent on January 12, 2008 
(at the time of announcement of the Third Quarter Review for 2007-08) increased to 
7.33 per cent on April 12, 2008 (at the time of announcement of the Annual Policy 
Statement for 2008-09) and to a high of 8.24 per cent on May 24, 2008. Further, 
various measures of CPI inflation, which ranged from 4.8 to 5.9 per cent in January 
2008 have increased to a range of 7.8 to 8.9 per cent in April 2008. 
 
The Annual Policy Statement for the year 2008-09 (April 29, 2008) had referred 
to the unprecedented uncertainties and dilemmas that exist and added "while 
monetary policy has to respond proactively to immediate concerns, it cannot afford to 
ignore considerations over a relatively longer term perspective of, say, one to two 
years, with respect to overall macroeconomic prospects. At the same time, it is critical 
at this juncture to demonstrate on a continuing basis a determination to act decisively, 
effectively and swiftly to curb any signs of adverse developments in regard to inflation 
expectations". 
   
In light of the above, and on a review of the current macroeconomic and overall 
monetary conditions and with a view to containing inflation expectations, it is essential 
to take appropriate action on an urgent basis. Accordingly, the Reserve Bank of India 
has decided to increase the repo rate under the Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) by 
25 basis points to 8.00 per cent from 7.75 per cent with immediate effect. There is no 
change in the reverse repo rate.
