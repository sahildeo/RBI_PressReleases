Pradesh with the objective of upgrading their human resources skills and technological 
infrastructure so that they improve their operational efficiency and quality of management 
information systems. 
It may be recalled that in the Mid-Term Review of Annual Policy announced in October 
2004, the Reserve Bank had announced that a vision document for Urban Co-operative Banks 
would be prepared.  Accordingly, the Reserve Bank placed in public domain a draft vision 
document in March 2005. As the Urban Co-operative Banks are subject to dual control by the 
Reserve Bank and the State Governments, the vision document envisaged the signing of MoU 
between State Governments and the Reserve Bank of India to put in place an arrangement 
through which there is a convergence on the approach and remedial actions required to be 
taken for facilitating the development of the sector.  The vision document also proposed the 
constitution of a State Level Task Force for Urban Co-operative Banks with representatives of 
State Government, State/National Federation of Urban Cooperative Banks and the Reserve 
Bank of India as its members, for the purpose of identifying the potentially viable Urban 
Cooperative Banks and drawing up a time-bound action plan for their revival by setting 
specific monitorable milestones.
