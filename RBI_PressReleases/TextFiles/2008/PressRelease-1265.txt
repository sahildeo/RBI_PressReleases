Statistical Tables Relating to Banks in India 1979-2007 
The Reserve Bank of India has released Statistical Tables Relating to Banks in 
India - 1979-2007.  
The publication, “Statistical Tables Relating to Banks in India - 1979-2007”, is an 
attempt to provide historical data relating to banks as published in various issues of 
“Statistical Tables Relating to Banks in India”. The publication also covers data in 
“Annual Accounts of Scheduled Commercial Banks (including Regional Rural Banks) 
1979-2004” published in 2004-05.  
The publication provides the following data: 
a) Bank-wise data on annual accounts (balance sheet and profit & loss 
accounts) of all scheduled commercial banks (including Regional Rural 
Banks) for the period from 1979 to 2006-07.  
b) Bank group-wise data on final Form ‘A’ returns data (under Section 42(2) of 
the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934) of all scheduled commercial banks 
(including Regional Rural Banks) from the fortnight ended January 9, 1981 to 
the fortnight ended March 30, 2007.  
c) Bank-wise data on some of the financial ratios from 1995-96 to 2006-07. 
d) Bank-wise data on number of employees from 1979 to 2007. These data 
have been provided by the Indian Banks’ Association. 
Data are presented in five sections:  
a) Bank-wise annual accounts data  
b) Bank-wise ratios on major banking indicators based on annual accounts data  
c) Bank group-wise annual accounts data  
d) Bank group-wise ratios on major banking indicators based on annual 
accounts data  
e) Major items of bank group-wise Section 42(2) data of the RBI Act, 1934  2
For annual accounts, data are collated from the various issues of the RBI 
publication, “Statistical Tables Relating to Banks in India”. For the years 1979 to 1989, 
data with respect to profit and loss accounts are available only for public sector banks 
(that is, State Bank of India and its Associates and Nationalised Banks). Data for the 
years 1979 to 1987 relate to the calendar year (that is, January-December), while those 
for the year 1988-89 pertain to the 15 month period, that is, from January 1, 1988 to 
March 31, 1989. From 1989-90 onwards, data relate to the financial year period (that is, 
April-March). 
For Form ‘A’, data used to be published on ad hoc basis in RBI publication 
“Selected Banking Indicators”. Last publication in this series was for the period 1982-
2002. These data are now included as a part of the historical data published here.  
For select ratios, data are collated from the various issues of the RBI publication, 
“Statistical Tables Relating to Banks in India”, starting from 1995-96. There are 36 ratios 
at the bank level and 29 ratios at the bank group level. Even though some of these 
ratios could have been presented for previous years, these are omitted, as these can be 
calculated based on the published data. Interestingly some of the ratios (for example, 
CRAR and net NPA to net advances), which directly can not be calculated based on 
published data, have been included here. For definitions of ratios presented in this 
publication reference may be made to the ‘Explanatory Notes’ given in the CD-ROM. 
The publication allows users to extract data from CD-ROM in a user-friendly 
query format which can also be exported to Microsoft Excel worksheet. 
 The data published in this CD-ROM are also made available through Internet at 
http://www.rbi.org.in in Microsoft Excel format.  
 The publication is priced at Rs.190/- (normal) & Rs.240/- (inclusive of postage) 
for inland and US $ 20 (inclusive of registered airmail) & US $ 55 (inclusive of courier 
charges) for abroad. 
 Queries and suggestions on the publication may be sent by e-mail. 
 Copies of the CD-ROMs can be obtained from the Director, Division of Reports, 
Reviews and Publications (Sales Section), Department of Economic Analysis and 
Policy, Reserve Bank of India, Amar Building, Ground Floor, P.M.Road, P.B.No.1036,
