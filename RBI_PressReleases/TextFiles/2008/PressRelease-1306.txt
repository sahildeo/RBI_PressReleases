The Reserve Bank of India today released on its website, the report of its internal

indebtedness in its totality and suggest measures to provide relief to farmers across the 
country. The Expert Group submitted its report to Government of India in July 2007. 
 
The Group had, in its report, made wide-ranging recommendations to address the issue 
of agricultural indebtedness. The recommendations included immediate credit–related 
measures, reforms in financial and institutional architecture, risk mitigation measures, 
etc. In the Mid-term Review of the Annual Policy 2007-08, it was proposed to constitute

to the Reserve Bank, in particular. The internal working group was set up under the 
chairmanship of Shri V.S.Das, Executive Director of the Reserve Bank. The internal
