Satellite Connectivity to facilitate Penetration of Banking Services – 
Need for Financial Incentives to Banks: Discussion Paper 
 
The availability of reliable communication network is an important prerequisite 
for facilitating electronic modes of payments. A paper was prepared by 
Prof.U.R.Rao, a member of the Board for Regulation and Supervision of the 
Payment and Settlement Systems (BPSS), Reserve Bank of India on the use of 
satellite communication technology to facilitate penetration of payment services to 
the rural areas which are denied these facilities due to non availability of reliable 
communication links. A Technical Group constituted by the Reserve Bank of India 
examined the proposal made by Prof. Rao and recommended that use of satellite 
connectivity would facilitate integration of the rural branches with their core banking 
solution and help providing funds transfer facility to their customers. The Group's 
recommendation was further examined and it was felt that there is a need for 
incentivising the banks by way of the Reserve Bank of India itself paying a part of the 
leased rentals if banks connect their branches in the North Eastern States and 
underbanked districts in the rest of the country.  
 
The Reserve Bank of India has today placed on its website, a discussion 
paper on this scheme for public comments. Comments may be sent up to June 30, 
2008 to the Chief General Manager, Department of Payment and Settlement 
Systems, Reserve Bank of India, Central Office, 14th floor, Central Office Building, 
Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Mumbai-400001 or faxed to 022- 22659566. Comments 
can also be e-mailed.

Satellite Connectivity to facilitate penetration of banking services –  
Need for financial incentives to banks: Discussion Paper 
 
1. Introduction: 
 
1.1 Prof.U.R.Rao, member of the Board for Regulation and Supervision of the Payment 
and Settlement Systems (BPSS) had prepared a paper on the use of satellite 
communication technology to facilitate penetration of payment services to the rural areas 
which are presently denied of the facility due to non availability of reliable communication 
links. The proposal was considered by a Technical Group.  The Group supported Prof. 
U.R. Rao's view point that satellite connectivity is the appropriate mode of connecting the 
branches in the areas not connected by terrestrial links and as a fallback system.  
 
1.2 The Reserve Bank has been taking a number of initiatives for upgradation of 
technology and bringing the masses under the banking system. Towards this, banks are 
being encouraged to computerize their operation and connect the branch under the core 
banking solution so that the branch can provide efficient services by participation in all 
India funds transfer network like RTGS / NEFT / ECS, etc. But the rural branches have 
remained largely outside core banking due to connectivity problem. The problem is more 
for the bank branches in the North Eastern Region.  
 
1.3 There is an uneven distribution of banking services in the country. Of the total 611 
districts in the country, 375 districts (list in the Annex) are under-banked. The total 
districts include 82 districts of the North-Eastern Region of which 54 districts are under-
banked. The under-banked district is the district where the Average Population per 
Branch Office (APPBO) is more than the national average. There is a need for banks to 
open branches at these locations and establishing connectivity with the core banking 
solution.  
 
1.4 The Reserve Bank, while playing its developmental role is considering a proposal to 
provide incentive to banks to provide network connectivity to their existing branches in 
the under banked districts. There is also a proposal to incentivise the banks to open new 
branches at these locations and bring them under core banking solution right from the 
beginning.   
2. Satellite Connectivity 
 
2.1 As opposed to terrestrial link, satellite connectivity involves use of transponder space 
on the satellite and communication equipment called Very Small Aperture Terminal 
(VSAT) at the place being connected for data communication. VSAT is particularly useful 
in the regions where leased line connectivity cannot be established like hilly areas, 
ocean, and desert. VSAT technologies ensure link security and reliability. The benefits of 
VSAT are (i) faster relocation; (ii) quick establishment of new sites; (iii) rapid installation 
of equipment at the customer's premise with limited infrastructure; (iv) reduced Network 
implementation time; (v) availability (99.9%) is far better than the availability of ground 
networks - reliability of data network; (vi) lowest TCO over terrestrial for multistage 
applications; (vii) highest uptime; (viii) security - VSAT networks are very secure and the 
ideal option for confidential, business sensitive data transfer; (ix) bandwidth on demand - 
the bandwidth channels can be regulated Independence from earth networks and 
infrastructure; and (x) reduced operational cost. 
 
3.  Recommendations of the Technical Group 
 
3.1 The Technical Group studied the various aspects of satellite connectivity including 
cost benefit analysis. Some of the major recommendations are as under:  
 
a. Banks should extend connectivity to rural branches through use of latest 
technology VSATs and other modes of terrestrial or fiber communication, 
wherever available. 
b. While limited connectivity for the purpose of fast money transfer could be taken 
up as an immediate goal, the banks should plan for full-fledged branch 
connectivity to core banking or similar systems, in order to provide all services 
including mobile banking in future.  
c. For VSATs, banks should explore between VSAT ownership or rental model, 
based on the cost. The Group provided detailed analysis for both these models 
so that the banks can take informed decision in the matter.  
d. The report provides bandwidth requirements and cost estimates under various 
scenarios based on informal inquiries with a few VSAT service providers.  
e. The central hub could be connected to the data centers through a terrestrial 
leased line with high bandwidth VSAT as a backup (on demand). Therefore, it 
may not be necessary to set up central servers at the hub site.  
 2f. Satellite Communications being the most disaster-proof, can be used as a back-
up for major centers, where a disaster can otherwise knock out terrestrial 
connection. Even satellite connection may be disrupted, but if the antenna is 
small, it can be quickly put back (as satellite, up in the sky, continues to function).  
 
3.2 The recommendations made by the Technical Group were examined and it was felt 
that the following options need to be examined further  
 
1) The option of leasing vis-à-vis ownership VSATs;  
2) Using VSAT as a backup to the terrestrial link;  
3) Creating sufficient incentives so that individual banks take initiatives.  
 
3.3 RBI could play the developmental and advisory role. The Standards, Quality and 
Model Service Level Agreement, Safeguards could be some of the parameters which 
could be prescribed by Reserve Bank. For better price, IBA may consolidate the 
requirements from banks and negotiate with the service providers. IBA would only have 
this one time role and thereafter operational responsibility may be with individual banks.  
 
4. Option of leasing vis-à-vis ownership 
 
4.1 For implementing VSAT based communication link, the user can either acquire the 
VSAT on ownership basis or take on lease rental basis from the VSAT service provider. 
The Technical Group examined the cost of ownership vis-à-vis leasing it. The Group 
estimated the number of VSATs required for this rural connectivity and worked out that 
average cost per VSAT on rental model as well as ownership model.  
 
4.2 The increasing pace in technology development has increased the pace of 
technology obsolence. Considering this aspect as also the cost consideration, the lease 
model would be better option which could be adopted. This is also usually adopted by 
the banks. Besides, there would be an option available to move to another service 
provider, if the service is not found satisfactory from the vendor from whom the VSAT 
has been leased. 
 
5. VSAT as backup to terrestrial link 
 
5.1 Presently, the bank branch connectivity is primarily through the use of landlines, 
particularly leased lines from telecom operators with ISDN connectivity acting as a 
backup wherever available. The leased line connectivity with higher bandwidth requires 
laying of fiber connectivity. However, fiber networking is not available in many semi-
 3urban and rural areas due to the large cost involved in creating such network as also the 
lack of large customer base in these areas, for high-speed network requirements.  
 
5.2 Satellite Communications being the most disaster-proof, can be used as a back-up 
for major centers, where a disaster can otherwise knock out terrestrial connection. Even 
satellite connection may be disrupted, but if the antenna is small, it can be quickly put 
back (as satellite, up in the sky, continues to function).  
 
6. Suggested Incentive Structure 
The incentive structure may broadly be as under:- 
 
a. for branches in the North-East and – upto 100% of the lease rentals to be 
reimbursed; 
b. branches in rural areas in other under-banked districts  - upto 75% of lease 
rentals to be reimbursed; 
c. for branches of under banked districts in semi-urban areas – about 50% of 
the lease rentals to be reimbursed. 
 
Incentives may be provided by the Reserve Bank of India by way of reimbursement of 
the leased rentals on a half yearly basis on a certificate of satisfactory service for 3 
years. A review on the need for continuing with the incentive structure would be carried 
out after 3 years.  
 
7. Safeguards 
 
The banks would need to put in place proper safeguards to ensure that the systems are 
optimally used. The banks going in for this incentive programme would have to put in 
place an appropriate Information Security (IS) and access policy. The access policy 
should at the minimum cover: (i) monitoring the operations of the system; (ii) access to 
authorized users, the roles and access rights of each of the authorized users are well 
defined; (iii) ensuring that the system is used for the purpose for which it has been 
provided.
