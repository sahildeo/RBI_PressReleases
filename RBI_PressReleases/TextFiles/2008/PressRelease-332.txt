Reserve Bank Cancels the Licence of 
The Achalpur Urban Co-operative Bank Ltd, Amravati, (Maharashtra) 
 
In view of the fact that The Achalpur Urban Co-operative Bank Ltd, Amravati, 
(Maharashtra) had ceased to be solvent, all efforts to revive it in close consultation with 
the Government of Maharashtra had failed and the depositors of the bank were being 
inconvenienced by continued uncertainty, the Reserve Bank of India delivered the order, 
canceling its licence to the bank after the close of business on November 4, 2008. The 
Registrar of Co-operative Societies, Maharashtra has also been requested to issue an 
order for winding up of the bank and appoint a Liquidator for the bank. It may be 
highlighted that on liquidation every depositor is entitled to repayment of his deposits up 
to a monetary ceiling of Rs.1, 00,000/- (Rupees One Lakh only) from the Deposit 
Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC).    
The bank was granted a licence by Reserve Bank on March 13, 1996 to 
commence banking business. The statutory inspection of the bank conducted by RBI 
with reference to its financial position as on March 31, 2007 revealed that the bank was 
not complying with several provisions of the Banking Regulation Act 1949 (As applicable 
to Cooperative Societies) and had also violated several RBI guidelines / instructions. 
The realizable value of capital and reserves (Net Worth) of the bank had become 
negative. The bank was placed under directions under Section 35A of the Banking 
Regulation Act 1949 (As Applicable to Cooperative Societies) vide order dated March 4, 
2008 precluding it from incurring any liability. 
The Reserve Bank issued a notice to the bank on March 26, 2008 asking it to 
show cause as to why the licence granted to it under Section 22 of the Banking 
Regulation Act, 1949(As Applicable to Cooperative Societies) on March 13, 1996 to 
conduct banking business should not be cancelled. The bank's reply to the show cause 
notice was examined and was found unacceptable. 
As the realizable value of bank's paid-up capital and reserves was negative and 
the chances of its revival were remote in the absence of a viable action plan, the 
Reserve Bank of India took the extreme measure of canceling licence of the bank after 
examining all options for its revival, in the interest of the bank's depositors. With the 
cancellation of its licence and commencement of liquidation proceedings, the process of 
paying the depositors of The Achalpur Urban Co-operative Bank Ltd, Amravati, 
(Maharashtra), the amount insured as per the DICGC Act will be set in motion. 
Consequent to the cancellation of its licence, The Achalpur Urban Co-operative 
Bank Ltd , Amravati, (Maharashtra) is prohibited from carrying on 'banking business' as 
defined in Section 5(b) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949(As Applicable to 
Cooperative Societies) including acceptance and repayment of deposits.

General Manager, Urban Banks Department, Reserve Bank of India, Nagpur. His
