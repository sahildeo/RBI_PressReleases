November 3, 2008 
Special Fixed Rate Repo under Liquidity Adjustment Facility 
On a review of current and evolving macroeconomic situation and liquidity 
conditions in the global and domestic financial markets, Reserve Bank announced, 
on November 1, 2008, further measures which include, on a purely temporary and 
ad-hoc basis and subject to review, extending the special term repo facility and 
allowing banks to avail liquidity support under the LAF through relaxation in the 
maintenance of SLR to the extent of up to 1.5 per cent of their NDTL. This relaxation 
in SLR is to be used exclusively for the purpose of meeting the funding requirements 
of NBFCs and MFs. Banks can apportion the total accommodation allowed above 
between MFs and NBFCs flexibly as per their business needs. Accordingly, Reserve 
Bank shall conduct the special fixed rate term repo under Liquidity Adjustment 
Facility every day until further notice up to a cumulative amount of Rs 60,000 crore 
on outstanding basis. This will subsume the existing Rs.20,000 crore facility 
announced by RBI on October 14, 2008.  
Under the extended arrangement, the Reserve Bank of India shall conduct on 
November 3, 2008, a special fixed rate term repo for 14 days at 7.5 per cent per 
annum for Rs.53,550 crore against eligible securities,  due for reversal on November 
17, 2008, with a view to enabling banks to meet the liquidity requirements of Mutual 
Funds (MFs) and Non-Banking Financial Companies(NBFCs), either on incremental 
or on rollover basis. Of the outstanding amount of Rs. 7995 crore as on October 31, 
2008, Rs. 1545 crore is due for redemption today.
