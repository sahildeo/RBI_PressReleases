Handbook of Statistics on the Indian Economy 2007-08 
The Reserve Bank of India today released the tenth volume of its annual 
statistical publication Handbook of Statistics on the Indian Economy 2007-08. This 
publication is one of the major initiatives of the Reserve Bank aimed at improving data 
dissemination by providing statistical information at one place. Through this publication, 
the Reserve Bank has been providing time series data on various economic and 
financial indicators for the Indian economy. 
The print volume contains 252 statistical tables covering national income 
aggregates, output, prices, money, banking, financial markets, public finances, foreign 
trade and balance of payments and select socio-economic indicators. In addition to the 
tables already contained in the earlier volume, the present volume contains a new table 
that provides monthly data on purchase and sales of US dollar by the Reserve Bank 
since 1997-98.  
The Handbook is brought out in three versions – print, CD-Rom and website. 
The CD-Rom incorporates intelligent search facilities that allow users to search across 
tables for one or more data series for a selected period. Data tables from the CD-Rom

modeling and forecasting by various statistical and econometric packages. The web-
