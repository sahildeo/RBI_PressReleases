RBI's Special Fixed Rate Term Repo Auction for Rs. 48,425 Crore Today 
The Reserve Bank of India shall conduct a special fixed rate term repo at 7.5 per cent per annum 
against eligible securities for Rs.48,425 crore on November 10, 2008, due for reversal on November 24, 
2008, with a view to enabling banks to meet the liquidity requirements of Mutual Funds (MFs) and Non-
Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) either on incremental or on rollover basis. Of the outstanding 
amount of Rs.11,725 crore as on Nov 07, 2008, Rs.150 crore is due for redemption today. 
It may be recalled that the Reserve Bank of India had announced earlier that it would conduct the 
special fixed rate term repo under Liquidity Adjustment Facility every day until further notice up to a 
cumulative amount of Rs 60,000 crore and that additional liquidity support to the extent of up to 1.5 per 
cent of their NDTL, can be availed by banks exclusively for the purpose of meeting requirements of MFs 
and NBFCs.
