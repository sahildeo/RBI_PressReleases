India’s External Debt as at the end of June 2008 
 
 
As per the extant practice, India's external debt statistics for the quarters ending March and 
June are compiled and released by the Reserve Bank, while the external debt data for quarters 
ending September and December are compiled and released by the Ministry of Finance, Government 
of India. A detailed account of external debt as compiled in the standard format as at end-June 2008 
in rupee and US dollar terms and revised data for earlier quarters are set out in Statement 1 and 2, 
respectively. 
 
1. Stock of External Debt 
 
The external debt was placed at US $ 221.3 billion at the end of June 2008 as against US $ 
220.7 billion at end-March 2008 recording an increase of US $ 0.6 billion or 0.3 per cent over the end-
March 2008 level (Table 1 and Chart 1).

2. Valuation Changes 
 
The valuation effect reflecting the appreciation of the US dollar against other major 
international currencies and Indian rupee resulted in a decline in external debt by US $ 4.5 billion. 
This implies that excluding the valuation effects, the stock of external debt as at end-June 2008 
increased by US $ 5.1 billion over the end-March 2008 level.  
 
3. Components of External Debt 
 
 The rise in external debt stock was essentially due to increase in short term debt which rose 
by US $ 2.2 billion during the quarter. The data on short term debt include both suppliers’ credit up to 
and above 180 days and FII investment in Government debt papers. The rise in short-term debt was 
mainly on account of rise in trade credit (in particular, trade credits above 180 days) attributed to the 
higher financing of imports during the quarter.  
 
Outstanding NRI deposits at US $ 42.6 billion as at end-June 2008 recorded a decline of US 
$ 1.1 billion over the level at end-March 2008. Despite inflows under NRI deposits during the quarter, 
the above decline in outstanding was mainly on account of valuation effect.  
 
The movements in the other components of external debt as at end June 2008 revealed that 
while there was an increase in multilateral debt and export credit, commercial borrowings, bilateral 
debt and rupee debt showed decline (Table 2 and Chart 2).

4.  External Debt by Residual Maturity 
 
While external debt is generally compiled in terms of original maturity, analysing the external 
debt in terms of residual maturity is important from the point of view of forex liquidity management and 
to ascertain the total forex outgo on account of debt service payments in the immediate future. The 
‘long term debt by residual maturity’ comprises the repayments due after one year under medium and 
long term debt by original maturity. On the other hand, the ‘short-term debt by residual maturity’ 
comprises the repayments due under medium and long-term debt by original maturity during one year 
reference period along with the short-term debt with original maturity. Based on residual maturity, out 
of total external debt of US $ 221.3 billion as at end-June 2008, long-term debt accounted for US $ 
132.3 billion or 59.8 per cent. Short-term debt by residual maturity at end-June 2008 stood at US $ 
89.0 billion accounting for 40.2 per cent of the total external debt. The ratio of short-term debt by 
residual maturity to foreign exchange reserves was 28.5 per cent at end-June 2008 (Table 3).

Notes:  1. Residual Maturity of NRI Deposits is estimated on the basis of the Survey conducted by the 
Reserve Bank on NRI deposits outstanding as on March 31, 2008. 
 
2. The maturity pattern of NRO Deposits that was not available in the March 31, 2007 survey is now 
available in the March 31, 2008 survey. The maturity-wise break up of NRO deposits are thus, given. 
 
3. FII investment in treasury bills and government dated securities are included under sovereign debt, 
while FII investment in corporate debt papers and other short-term debt instruments are included 
under Commercial Borrowings.

5. Currency Composition 
 
While the US dollar is generally used as the numeraire currency for computing external debt 
in order to facilitate international comparison, the currency composition of the external debt is 
essential to understand the currencies in which the debt is actually denominated and hence the extent 
of the economy’s vulnerability to solvency and liquidity risks. It also gives an idea of the extent of 
exposure of the economy to cross currency exchange rate movements. The currency composition of 
India’s external debt is generally disseminated in terms of major foreign currencies such as US 
dollars, Japanese yen, Euro, Pound Sterling, Special Drawing Rights (SDR) and the domestic 
currency i.e., Indian rupee.  
 
In this regard, it is stated that while calculating currency composition, the short term trade 
credit was generally taken to be in dollars as most of it was denominated in US dollars. However, 
recognising the growing volume of such credits in the recent years on the back of burgeoning imports 
and the increasing significance of currencies other than US dollar in the short term credit, the original 
currency breakup of the short term trade credit above 180 days was computed for end-March 2008 
and end-June 2008. It was observed that about 70 per cent of the short term trade credit is 
denominated in US dollars, 14 per cent in yen, 13 per cent in Euro and the balance in other 
currencies.  
 
Looking at the overall external debt position, the US Dollar continues to remain the 
predominant currency accounting for 52.3 per cent of the total external debt stock as at the end of 
June 2008, followed by the Japanese yen (14.2  per cent), Indian rupee (14.1 per cent) and SDR 
(10.2 per cent) (Table 4 and Chart 3). The share of Euro has seen a rise from 4.0 per cent as at end-
March 2007 to 6.2 per cent as at end-June 2008.

has been taken to be denominated in US dollars.

currency composition of short term debt inflows during 2007-08.

6. Indicators of Debt Sustainability 
 
The external debt sustainability indicators of India are set out in Table 5. 
 
•  The share of concessional debt in total external debt declined to 19.3 per cent at end-
June 2008 from 19.9 per cent at end-March 2008 reflecting the continuing increase in 
non-concessional private debt in India's external debt stock.  
 
Reflecting the rise in short term debt during the quarter, the ratio of short-term to total 
• 
debt and short term debt to reserves has risen to 20.8 per cent and 14.7 per cent at end 
June 2008 from 19.9 per cent and 14.1 per cent at end March 2008, respectively.  
 
• India’s foreign exchange reserves exceeded the external debt by US $ 90.8 billion 
providing a cover of 141.0 per cent to the external debt stock at the end of June 2008.  
 
• Based on the revised external debt outstanding as at end-March 2008, external debt to 
GDP is placed at 18.7 per cent at end-March 2008 as compared with 17.8 per cent at 
end-March 2007.  
  
• The debt service ratio is placed at 3.9 per cent during April-June 2008 as against 5.4 per 
cent during 2007-08 and a double-digit figure till 2003-04.

7. Cross Country Comparison 
 
Comparing the cross country data on external debt provided by the World Bank in the Global 
Development Finance, 2008 for the year 2006 for the top twenty debtor countries of the developing 
world reveal the following (Table 7): 
 
• India’s position was fifth in 2006 in terms of external debt stock.  
 
• In terms of the ratio of external debt to Gross National Product (GNP), India’s position 
was second lowest, with China having the lowest ratio of external debt to GNP.  
 
• India’s debt service ratio was third lowest with China and Malaysia having first and 
second lowest debt service ratio, respectively. 
 
• The element of concessionality in India’s external debt portfolio was the second highest 
after Indonesia 
 
• In terms of reserves to total debt, India’s position was fifth after China, Malaysia, Thailand 
and Russia.
