RBI announces Reduction in CRR for Liquidity Management 
On October 6, 2008 the Reserve Bank of India announced a reduction of the 
cash reserve ratio (CRR) for scheduled banks by 50 basis points to 8.5 per cent of net 
demand and time liabilities (NDTL) with effect from the fortnight beginning October 11, 
2008. This measure was undertaken with a view to injecting liquidity into domestic 
financial markets so as to alleviate the pressures brought on by the deterioration in the 
global financial environment. In the ensuing days, the global situation has worsened 
further. International stock markets and money markets had been   adversely affected 
in a significant manner. Central banks across the world have responded to these 
extraordinary developments by synchronised policy actions including measures for 
liquidity infusion.  
In the context of the abrupt changes in the international financial environment, it 
is important to note that the macroeconomic fundamentals of the Indian economy are 
strong and resilient and that India's financial system is sound, well-capitalised and well-
regulated. Money and forex markets in India have been operating in a relatively orderly 
manner. The current domestic market conditions are essentially a reflection of the 
adverse developments and extreme uncertainty in international financial markets.  
Market participants are assured that the Reserve Bank stands ready to respond 
swiftly to meet any liquidity requirements that may arise in the context of the highly 
volatile external situation.   
Accordingly, on a review of the evolving liquidity situation in the context of global 
and domestic developments, it has been decided to reduce the Cash Reserve Ratio 
(CRR) by 150 basis points to 7.50 per cent of NDTL with effect from the fortnight 
beginning October 11, 2008 instead of the 50 basis points reduction announced on 
October 6, 2008. As a result of this reduction in the CRR, an amount of about Rs 
60,000 crore would be released into the system (instead of the injection of Rs 20, 000 
crore announced earlier).  
The Reserve Bank is monitoring developments closely and continuously and 
would respond swiftly and even preemptively to any adverse external developments 
impinging on domestic financial stability, price stability and inflation expectations and 
the continuation of the growth momentum of the Indian economy. The Reserve Bank is 
committed to maintaining financial stability and active and flexible liquidity management 
using all policy instruments is an integral part of this objective.
