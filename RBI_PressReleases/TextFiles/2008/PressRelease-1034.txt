Government Securities get Investor Friendly 
  Government Securities, including the Relief/Savings Bonds issued by the 
Government of India, have now become more investor friendly with additional features, such 
as, automatic redemption facility and nomination facility. The holder of a Government 
Security now has the facility to create pledge, hypothecation or lien in respect of such 
security. Moreover, the procedure to recognise the title to a Government Security of 
deceased holders has further been simplified and it can be done now on the basis of any 
valid document admissible in a court of law.  
These investor friendly features have been added to Government Securities in the 
Government Securities Act, 2006 (Act) and the Government Securities Regulations, 2007 
(Regulations) which came into effect from December 1, 2007. Investors of Relief/Savings 
Bonds and holders of other Government Securities are likely to benefit from these changes. 
 Holders of Government Securities, including Relief/Savings Bonds, can now simply 
give their bank details in an Electronic Clearing Services (ECS) mandate form to the Public 
Debt Offices (PDOs), RBI, if Government Securities have been issued by PDOs or to the 
agency bank for the Relief/Savings Bonds issued by them. This will facilitate the receipt of 
the redemption amount of Government Securities and interest accrued thereon from time to 
time in their bank account. Once ECS mandate form is given to the RBI/agency banks, the 
holders will not have to separately submit physical discharge towards maturing Government 
Securities to receive the redemption amount. RBI/agency banks will automatically credit the 
holder's account with the maturity proceeds. The facility of automatic redemption is 
applicable to all Government Securities held in the form of Stock Certificate (SC), Bond 
Ledger Account (BLA) and Subsidiary General Ledger Account (SGL).  
  The new Act also provides the facility of nomination, of one or more persons, to the 
investors of Government Securities, including Relief/Savings Bonds, except those which are 
in the form of promissory notes and bearer bonds.  
 Further, recognition and conferment of title to a Government Security of deceased 
sole holder or joint holders has been simplified. This can now be done on the basis of a 
decree, order or direction passed by a competent court or on the basis of a certificate issued 
or order passed by any other authority who might have been empowered under any statute 
to confer on any such person a title to the Government Security or on the basis of such other 
prescribed documents. Accordingly, any of the following six documents can also be 
submitted for recognition of title to Government Security of deceased holder or joint holders:- 
• a "will” executed by the deceased holder of the Government Security bequeathing 
thereby the security in favour of the person claiming title thereto, provided the 
probate issued in respect of such will has been submitted to the Bank by the 
claimant; or   2
• a "registered deed of family settlement", wherein the Government Security claimed 
has been included and given to the claimant; or 
• a "gift-deed" executed in accordance with the law relating thereto, in respect of the 
Government Security claimed; or 
• a "deed of relinquishment" executed by other legal heir or successor of the deceased 
in accordance with law in favour of the claimant in respect of the Government 
Security claimed; or 
• a "decree passed by a foreign court" in respect of the Government Security claimed, 
the execution whereof is permissible in accordance with the provisions of section 44A 
of the Civil Procedure Code, 1908 (5 of 1908); or  
• a "deed of partition" executed and acted upon in accordance with law, wherein the 
Government Security claimed has been included and given to the share allotted to 
the claimant. 
 The other features of the Act that will facilitate deepening and widening of 
Government Securities market are: 
(i) Stripping and reconstitution of Government Securities;  
(ii) Legal recognition of beneficial ownership of the investors in Government Securities 
through the Constituents' Subsidiary General Ledger (CSGL); and 
(iii) Statutory backing for the Reserve Bank's power to debar Subsidiary General Ledger 
(SGL) account holders from trading, either temporarily or permanently, for misuse of 
SGL account facility. 
To create public awareness and as a customer friendly measure, FAQs on the 
subject as also the format of ECS mandate form have also been placed on the website of
