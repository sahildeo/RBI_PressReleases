RBI Package for Flood affected Areas in Bihar 
 
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has activated its relief package for the districts 
affected by severe floods in the State of Bihar. At the instance of the Reserve Bank, an 
emergency meeting of the controlling heads of banks was convened on August 28, 
2008 at Patna to invoke the RBI relief package. The Reserve Bank is constantly in 
touch with the State Government and banks to assess the situation with a view to 
taking any additional measures that may be considered necessary.  The Reserve Bank 
is also taking special measures to ensure the movement and adequate supply of 
currency notes in these areas.  
 
Under the RBI package, bank branches are required to initiate the package of 
measures immediately after the district/state authorities declare the district/State as 
calamity affected area and to provide financial assistance to the agriculturists, small 
scale industrial units, artisans, small businesses and trading establishments affected by 
natural calamities. 
 
The measures include consumption loans to persons affected by calamities for 
sustenance, waiver of margin requirements or considering as margin the grants, 
subsidies provided by state governments, provision of credit not only to existing 
borrowers but also to other eligible persons within the jurisdiction of the bank branch 
and who are not covered by any other financial  intermediary as also conversion and 
rescheduling/restructuring of existing loans in the case of crop failure due to natural 
calamities. The package also includes providing to affected persons term loans for 
developmental purposes. Further, banks while using their discretion on charging of 
interest are required to view such cases sympathetically and consider waiving of penal 
interest to be charged for default of current dues and deferment of compounding of 
interest.  
 
The Reserve Bank of India instructions are aimed at ensuring quick restoration 
of all banking services in areas affected by floods. The Reserve Bank's instructions 
include providing continued access to the customers to their bank accounts and 
facilitating opening of new accounts by persons affected by natural calamities, 
especially for availing reliefs given by Government/other agencies. The guidelines also 
cover measures to be taken by banks to ensure continuity in other services like cheque 
clearing services and supply of cash.  
 According to the Reserve Bank guidelines, in areas where the bank branches 
are affected by natural calamity and are unable to function normally, banks may 
operate from temporary premises, under advice to the Reserve Bank. Banks may also 
ensure rendering of banking services to the affected areas by setting up satellite 
offices, extension counters or mobile banking facilities. Further, to satisfy customer’s 
immediate cash requirements, banks could consider waiving the penalties for accessing 
accounts, such as, fixed deposits. Restoration of the functioning of ATMs at the earliest 
or making alternate arrangements for providing such facilities may be given due 
importance. Banks may consider putting in place arrangements for allowing their 
customers to access other ATM networks, mobile ATMs, etc. Banks are allowed to 
open cash repositories for temporary period reckoned as part of the currency chest 
balances for meeting cash requirements in the areas where currency chest services are 
dislocated. While extending financial assistance, banks may provide consumption loans 
up to Rs. 10,000 or higher as the banks may decide, which could be used by those 
affected for food, shelter material, etc., extend timely fresh financial assistance to 
resume productive activities not only to the existing borrowers, but also to other eligible 
borrowers; and depending on the severity of the calamity and its recurrence, extend the 
period of repayment of restructured term loans ranging from 7 to 10 years with one year 
of moratorium.
