Governor Dr. D. Subbarao's Press Statement 
 
“Economy 
The economy clocked growth of 8.9 per cent on an average annual basis over the last five 
years.  Despite the slow-down in advanced economies, the global financial turmoil and volatile 
commodity prices, growth in the first quarter of 2008-09, on an annualised basis, was 7.9 per cent – 
among the highest in the world.   
India's remarkable economic expansion from an average of 5% in the 90s to close to 9% in the 
recent period has been led by rise in private consumption, rise in private investment and surge in 
exports.  I believe these engines of growth are still on track.  The recent moderation is only a cyclical 
down-turn.  The structural India growth story is still in-tact and credible. 
 
Monetary Policy 
The current high level of domestic inflation reflects a combination of supply-side pressures as 
well as demand-side factors. It is not surprising that after five years of 9 per cent growth, supply 
constraints will begin to emerge. However, the present inflation is largely a global phenomenon and is 
being driven by key international commodity prices, especially of crude oil, metals and food. These 
external pressures are being exacerbated by strong domestic demand pressures. Though demand is not 
the main problem, in the absence of further flexibility on the supply side, demand management has to be 
part of the solution. Dampening demand and anchoring inflation expectations has been the logic behind 
Reserve Bank's monetary stance.  
For sustained economic growth, it is essential that inflation and inflation expectations be 
contained. Our high growth over the past five years was accompanied by low and stable inflation, and 
financial stability. Our policy stance must ensure similar outcomes in the years ahead. Some have 
argued that the monetary measures initiated by the Reserve Bank will affect growth. As I had said earlier, 
the intent behind monetary tightening was, in fact, to moderate demand, and hence, some slow-down 
should not surprise us.  
What, in fact, is the counterfactual? Not tightening the monetary policy and exposing ourselves to 
the possibility of a runaway generalised inflation? That too would have eroded confidence in the 
economy. Indeed, the impact on growth and the impact on the poor may have been more severe under 
such a situation.  
I have been asked whether monetary policy will be tightened further. There are, as they say, 
several known unknowns. First, we will have to watch the impact of the measures already taken. Second, 
we will be watching the drivers of demand – in particular which sectors are triggering the growth in 
demand. Third, in a globalised world, we will also have to be watching developments around the world 
and make an assessment of their potential impact on our economic management. All I can say is that we 
will be monitoring the situation closely and continuously, be mindful of the implications of our monetary 
stance on the growth prospects, and take action as appropriate.   
 
Financial Sector 
Now let me turn to the financial sector. First of all it is heartening to note that the Report on 
Currency and Finance put out by the RBI last week finds improvement in the efficiency of the Indian 
banking sector, especially of the public sector banks.   
Quite evidently, the upward shift in our growth trajectory has been possible because of the higher 
pace of investment. Investment as a share of GDP, increased from 25 per cent in 2002-03 to 38 per cent 
in 2007-08. Of this 13 percentage points increase, as much as 10 percentage points was financed 
domestically through higher household, public sector and corporate savings.  
It is in the intermediation of these savings into investments that the Indian financial sector played 
a key role in our growth story. While what the financial sector has achieved is impressive, the task ahead 
is formidable. The financial sector has to become more competitive, efficient and forward looking. This 
underscores the importance of financial sector reforms. The Reserve Bank is deeply conscious of this. 
On the way forward on financial sector reforms, we are not short of analysis and advice. There 
are a number of reports, notably the Patil Committee on corporate bond markets, the Percy Mistry 
Committee on making Mumbai an international financial centre and the forthcoming Raghuram Rajan 
Committee on financial sector reforms. The recent Currency and Finance Report of the RBI, as also the 
previous Report, are important and valuable additions to this list. The Government and the RBI will also 
be bringing out, shortly, a comprehensive report of the Committee on Financial Sector Assessment.  
What we need to do is to use the available analyses and advice to draw a roadmap that 
responds to our immediate and medium term needs. Obviously this is a shared responsibility of the 
government, the RBI and indeed all other regulators. Consultation with all stakeholders will be an 
important process on the way forward. We will engage in this task in earnestness. 
I want to conclude on the subject of financial sector reforms with three short comments. First, the 
liberalisation and development of the financial sector over the last few years has been a key factor in 
financing our 9 per cent growth. To sustain and accelerate this growth, financial sector reform, aimed at 
improved efficiency and financial stability, will remain important. In moving forward, we will draw from the 
lessons of global experience of the recent period, and be cognizant of the evolving global situation. 
Second, financial sector reforms are not an end in themselves. They have meaning and relevance only if 
they are anchored in real sector objectives. Third, financial sector reforms should promote inclusive 
growth through efficient and easily accessible financial services.”
