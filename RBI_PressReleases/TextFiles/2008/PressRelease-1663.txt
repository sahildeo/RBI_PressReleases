Reserve Bank Cancels the Licence of 
Shree Janata Sahakara Bank Ltd., Radhanpur (Gujarat) 
 
In view of the fact that Shree Janata Sahakara Bank Ltd., Radhanpur 
(Gujarat) had ceased to be solvent, all efforts to revive it in close consultation with 
the Government of Gujarat had failed and the depositors of the bank were being 
inconvenienced by continued uncertainty, the Reserve Bank of India delivered the 
order, canceling its licence to the bank after the close of business on January 31, 
2008. The Registrar of Co-operative Societies, Gujarat has also been requested 
to issue an order for winding up of the bank and appoint a Liquidator for the bank. 
It may be highlighted that on liquidation every depositor is entitled to repayment of 
his deposits up to a monetary ceiling of Rs.1,00,000/- (Rupees One Lakh only) 
from the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC).  
 
The bank was granted a licence by Reserve Bank of India on December 
13, 1986 to commence banking business. Due to liquidity problems and high 
NPAs, the bank was placed under directions under Section 35A of the Banking 
Regulation Act 1949 (As Applicable to Cooperative Societies) vide order dated 
January 25, 2005 placing a ceiling on repayment of deposits upto Rs. 1000/- per 
depositor. The statutory inspection of the bank conducted by RBI with reference to 
its financial position as on March 31, 2006 revealed that the bank’s financial 
position had further deteriorated and its realisable value of capital and reserves 
(Net Worth) had become negative. 
 
The Reserve Bank issued a notice to the bank on December 15, 2006 
asking it to show cause as to why the licence granted to it under Section 22 of the 
Banking Regulation Act, 1949(As Applicable to Cooperative Societies) on 
December 13, 1986 to conduct banking business should not be cancelled. The 
bank's reply to the show cause notice was examined and was found 
unacceptable. The bank’s efforts to merge with another sound bank did not 
succeed. 
 
Meanwhile, the next inspection of the bank with reference to financial 
position as on March 31, 2007 revealed further deterioration in the financial 
position. As the realisable value of bank's paid-up capital and reserves was 
negative and the chances of its revival were remote, in the absence of a viable 
action plan, the Reserve Bank of India took the extreme measure of canceling 
licence of the bank after examining all options for its revival, in the interest of the 
bank's depositors. With the cancellation of its licence and commencement of 
liquidation proceedings, the process of paying the depositors of Shree Janata 
Sahakara Bank Ltd., Radhanpur (Gujarat), the amount insured as per the DICGC 
Act will be set in motion. 
  2
Consequent to the cancellation of its licence, Shree Janata Sahakara Bank 
Ltd., Radhanpur (Gujarat) is prohibited from carrying on 'banking business' as 
defined in Section 5(b) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949(As Applicable to 
Cooperative Societies) including acceptance and repayment of deposits.
