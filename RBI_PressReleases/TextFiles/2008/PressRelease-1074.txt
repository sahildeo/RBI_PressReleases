International Investment Position (IIP) of India as at end-December 2007 
 
 The International Investment Position (IIP), compiled at the end of a specific period such as 
end-March, is the statement of the stock of external financial assets and liabilities of a country. The 
financial assets consist of the country's financial claims on non-residents and financial liabilities 
consist of the country's financial liabilities to non-residents. These transactions are classified 
according to institutional resident sectors, namely, monetary authority, government, banks, and 
other sectors including corporate sector. The net international investment position (the stock of 
external financial assets less the stock of external financial liabilities) shows the difference between 
what an economy owns in relation to what it owes.  
As per the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) of the International Monetary Fund 
(IMF), data on IIP are to be disseminated on annual basis (quarterly encouraged) with a time lag of 
two quarters. In India, since the quarter end-June 2006 onwards, the IIP is being disseminated on 
quarterly basis with a lag of less than two quarters. The quarterly IIP as at end-September 2007 
was last released on RBI website on March 19, 2008. 
The quarterly IIP of India as at end-December 2007 has been compiled now and the major 
highlights are summarized below: 
 
I. Overall International Investment Position  
(1) The net IIP (Assets – Liabilities) of India resulted in net claims of non-residents to India 
(resulting largely from Portfolio & Direct Investment in India and external commercial loans), which 
marginally increased by US$ 1.23 billion to US$ 73.90 billion as at end-December 2007 from a 
level of US$ 72.67 billion as at end-September 2007 (Table I). 
(2) Among external financial assets, the Reserve Assets increased by US$ 27.56 billion over the 
end-September 2007 and was at US$ 275.32 billion at end-December 2007. The Direct Investment 
abroad witnessed an increase of US $ 3.57 billion during the same period and was at US$ 38.95 
billion as at end-December 2007.   2
