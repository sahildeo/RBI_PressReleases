RBI announces rate of interest on Floating Rate Bonds, 2009 
 
The rate of interest on the Government of India Floating Rate Bonds, 2009 
(FRB, 2009) applicable for the half-year (June 6, 2008 to December 5, 2008) shall be 
7.51 per cent per annum. 
 
It may be recalled that the rate of interest on the FRB, 2009 was set at a 
mark-up (as decided in the auction held on December 5, 2001) over and above the 
variable base rate. The variable base rate for payment of interest shall be the 
average rate (rounded off up to two decimal places) of the implicit yields at cut-off 
prices emerging in six auctions of Government of India 364-day Treasury Bills 
immediately preceding the relative half yearly coupon reset date. The variable base 
rate based on the average rate of the implicit yields at cut-off prices of the said last 
six auctions of Government of India 364-day Treasury Bills works out to 7.52 per 
cent. The mark-up decided in the auction held on December 5, 2001 was (-) 0.01 per 
cent (minus one basis point). The coupon rate has been fixed accordingly.
