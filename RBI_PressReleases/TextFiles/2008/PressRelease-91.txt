Reserve Bank Cancels the Licence of Shri Siddhi Venkatesh Sahakari Bank Ltd., 
Jalgaon, Maharashtra 
In view of the fact that Shri Siddhi Venkatesh Sahakari Bank Ltd., Jalgaon, 
Maharashtra, had ceased to be solvent, all efforts to revive it in close consultation with the 
Government of Maharashtra had failed and the depositors were being inconvenienced by 
continued uncertainty, the Reserve Bank of India delivered the order canceling its licence to the 
bank after the close of business on December 06, 2008. The Registrar of Co-operative 
Societies, Maharashtra has also been requested to issue an order for winding up the bank and 
appoint a liquidator for the bank.  It may be highlighted that on liquidation, every depositor is 
entitled to repayment of his/her deposits up to a monetary ceiling of Rs. 1,00,000/- (Rupees 
One lakh only) from the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) under 
usual terms and conditions.  
The bank was granted a licence by Reserve Bank on February 16,1998 to commence 
banking business.  The statutory inspection of the bank with respect to its position as on March 
31, 2006 had indicated that its financial position was impaired. The subsequent inspection 
conducted with reference to its financial position as on March 31, 2007 revealed further 
deterioration in bank's financial position. The Reserve Bank of India issued directions under 
Section 35 A of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (As applicable to Co-operative Societies) on  
May 12, 2008 restricting its operations, including placing a ceiling on withdrawal of deposits at 
Rs. 1000/-. 
The Reserve Bank of India issued a notice to the bank on May 12, 2008 asking it to 
show cause as to why the licence granted to it to conduct banking business should not be 
cancelled. The reply to the show cause notice was examined and it was observed that the bank 
did not have any viable plan of action for its revival.  
In the absence of any viable proposal for turning around and achieving the required 
regulatory prescriptions, the possibility of revival of the bank was remote. Therefore, the 
Reserve Bank of India took the extreme measure of cancelling licence of the bank in the 
interest of the bank's depositors. With the cancellation of its licence and commencement of 
liquidation proceedings, the process of paying the depositors of Shri Siddhi Ventatesh Sahakari 
Bank Ltd., Jalgaon, Maharashtra will be set in motion subject to the terms and conditions of the 
Deposit Insurance Scheme.   
Consequent to the cancellation of its licence, Shri Siddhi Ventatesh Sahakari Bank Ltd., 
Jalgaon, Maharashtra is prohibited from carrying on ‘banking business’ as defined in Section 
5(b) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (AACS) including acceptance and repayment of 
deposits.

Manager, Urban Banks Department, Reserve Bank of India, Mumbai. His contact details are as
