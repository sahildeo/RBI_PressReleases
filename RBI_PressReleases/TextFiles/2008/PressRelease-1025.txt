RBI Releases DRG Study on “Agricultural Growth in India since 1991” 
[Note: Development Research Group (DRG) is constituted in the Reserve 
Bank's Department of Economic Analysis and Policy for undertaking effective 
policy-oriented research backed by strong analytical and empirical basis on 
subjects of current interests. The views expressed in these studies are those of 
the authors and do not reflect the views of the Reserve Bank] 
The Reserve Bank of India today published a Study entitled ‘Agricultural 
Growth in India since 1991’.  The Study is co-authored by Prof. Pulapre 
Balakrishnan, Senior Fellow, Nehru Memorial Museum and Library, New Delhi, 
along with research staff members from the Reserve Bank (Shri Ramesh Golait 
and Shri Pankaj Kumar). The Study was undertaken under aegis of the 
Development Research Group. 
Indian economy witnessed the slowing of agriculture at a time when the 
rest of the economy is growing at unprecedented rates. The slow growth of 
agriculture has been explicitly noted as a matter of concern in the ‘Approach 
Paper to the Eleventh Plan’. Further, accelerating the rate of growth of agricultural 
production is seen as central to a more inclusive growth. 
The Study addresses slow growth of the agricultural sector since 1991. The 
Study documents the movement of the factors that have been recognised as 
determining agricultural growth during this period with a view to identifying the 
proximate causes of the slowdown. The focus in this Study is exclusively on crop 
agriculture. Factors, such as, relative price movement at the aggregate and at the 
disaggregated (crop-wise) level, import penetration, shrinking farm size, 
investment in agriculture, research and extension and agriculture credit have been 
investigated to ascertain their impact on agricultural growth in India since 1991.     
The major findings of the Study are :  
• The Study does not find evidence to the contention that relative price 
movement might have played a determining factor in explaining slow 
growth of agriculture since 1991. The profile of relative prices over the past 
15 years indicates too mild a shift, if at all, to consider relative price 
movements as central to understanding the slowing of agricultural growth 
since 1991. The role of import liberalisation in determining this price 
movement appears to be marginal too, except perhaps for some crops in 
some periods. 
 • The Study finds that smaller farm holding-size, by making it more difficult 
for the majority of Indian farms to access new technology and adopt more 
efficient forms of farm production organisation, may have adversely 
affected agricultural growth. 
• The Study reveals that among the factors likely to be responsible for slow 
growth is stagnation of public investment for almost a quarter of a century, 
along with a slowing of irrigation expansion since 1991. 
 
• The Study observes that production is increasingly being carried out in a 
more open economy, even though import penetration is very low currently 
for most crops. The Study suggests the need for expansion of publicly-
provided research and extension to support farming under a changed 
environment. 
• The Study documents, public expenditure on research and extension, 
historically low as a share of agricultural output in India by international 
standards, has registered a slower growth in real terms since 1990. 
• The Study cautions against the reading that greater spending alone is the 
solution to the current impasse in Indian agriculture. The Study provides 
evidence, intended as an illustrative case, that steady growth of real 
expenditure since 1991 has actually coincided with a slowing rate of 
expansion of the percentage area irrigated. This indicates a declining 
efficiency of public investment and suggests that governance is as much an 
issue as greater allocation of funds.
