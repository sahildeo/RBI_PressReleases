 Major sources of accretion to foreign exchange reserves during the Q1 of 2008-09 
have been Foreign Direct Investment, Banking Capital, Short-Term Credit and External 
Commercial Borrowings (ECBs). The accretion to the foreign exchange reserves was US $ 
2.2 billion on a BoP basis (excluding valuation effects) during Q1 of 2008-09. Valuation gain, 
reflecting the appreciation of major currencies against the US dollar, accounted for US $ 0.2 
billion in total reserves during Q1 of 2008-09 as against a valuation gain of US $ 3.0 billion 
during the corresponding period of previous year. The foreign exchange reserves have 
increased by an amount of US $ 2.4 billion during Q1 of 2008-09 including the valuation 
effects as compared with an increase of US $ 14.2 billion during Q1 of 2007-08.
