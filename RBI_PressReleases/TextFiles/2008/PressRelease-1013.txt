Joint Press Release

Signing of the Bilateral Swap Arrangement between Japan and India 
The Bank of Japan (BOJ), acting as the agent for the Minister of Finance of 
Japan, and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) concluded a Bilateral Swap Arrangement 
(BSA) between Japan and India.  The BSA was signed by Governor Masaaki 
Shirakawa of the BOJ and Governor Yaga Venugopal Reddy of the RBI in Basel, 
Switzerland and became effective as of June 29, 2008. 
 
The BSA enables both countries to swap their local currencies (i.e., either 
Japanese yen or Indian rupee) against US dollar for an amount up to USD 3 billion. 
 
The arrangement aims at addressing short-term liquidity difficulties and 
supplementing the existing international financial arrangements, as one of the efforts 
in strengthening mutual cooperation between Japan and India.   
 
The BSA will be activated when an IMF-support programme already exists or 
is expected to be established in the near future.  Nevertheless, up to 20 per cent of 
the maximum amount of drawing could be disbursed without an IMF-support 
program. 
 
Both countries shall have biannual consultations on economic and financial 
conditions of each country with the BSA in effect.   
 
This arrangement is a milestone in mutual cooperation between Japan and 
India and is expected to contribute to the stability of financial markets.
