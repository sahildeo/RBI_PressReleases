Investment in Credit Information Companies 
The Reserve Bank of India has issued a directive today clarifying that while 
considering applications for grant of certificate of registration under the Credit 
Information Companies (Regulation) Act, 2005, it would ensure that no single 
investor, whether resident in India or outside India, holds more than 10 per cent of 
the equity capital of any credit information company. The ceiling of 10 per cent will be 
equally applicable to investments made under the Foreign Direct Investment 
Scheme. This is in line with its policy of ensuring well diversified ownership of banks 
and other entities in the financial sector as well as entities in financial sector 
infrastructure.
