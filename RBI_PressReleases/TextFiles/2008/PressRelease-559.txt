RBI Reduces CRR for Liquidity Management 
It may be recalled that on September 16, 2008, the Reserve Bank announced 
several measures to alleviate the pressures on domestic financial markets brought 
on by external developments in response to the bankruptcy/sell-out/restructuring of 
some of the world's largest financial institutions. Since then, there has been a sharp 
deterioration in the global financial environment with the number of troubled financial 
institutions rising, stock markets weakening and money markets strained. Central 
banks across the world have stepped up their liquidity operations, including 
coordinated actions, and some have banned/limited short selling of financial stocks. 
 These new developments have impacted domestic money and forex markets with a 
marked increase in volatility and a sharp squeeze on market liquidity as reflected in 
the movements in overnight interest rates and the high recourse to the LAF.  
On a review of the current liquidity situation in the context of global and 
domestic developments, it has been decided to reduce the CRR from its current level 
of 9.0 per cent of net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) by 50 basis points to 8.5 per 
cent of NDTL with effect from the fortnight beginning October 11, 2008. As a result of 
this reduction in the CRR, an amount of about Rs 20, 000 crore would be released 
into the system. This measure is ad hoc, temporary in nature and will be reviewed on 
a continuous basis in the light of the evolving liquidity conditions.  
Active liquidity management is a key element of the current monetary policy 
stance. Liquidity modulation through a flexible use of a combination of instruments  
has, to a significant extent, cushioned the impact of the international financial 
turbulence on domestic financial markets by absorbing excessive market pressures 
and ensuring orderly conditions In view of the evolving environment of heightened 
uncertainty, volatility in global markets and the dangers of potential spillovers to 
domestic equity and currency markets, liquidity management will continue to receive 
priority in the hierarchy of policy objectives over the period ahead. The Reserve 
Bank will continue with its policy of active demand management of liquidity through 
appropriate use of the CRR stipulations and open market operations (OMO) 
including the MSS and the LAF, using all the policy instruments at its disposal 
flexibly, as and when the situation warrants. 
The overall stance of monetary policy in 2008-09 accords high priority to price 
stability, well-anchored inflation expectations and orderly conditions in financial 
markets while being conducive to continuation of the growth momentum, as set out 
in the Annual Policy Statement and reiterated in the First Quarter Review of July 
2008. The overriding priority for monetary policy is to eschew any further 
intensification of inflationary pressures and to firmly anchor inflation expectations.
