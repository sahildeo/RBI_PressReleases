 It may be recalled that the Reserve Bank of India appointed a committee on financial 
sector assessment in September 2006 to :  
 
(i) Identify the appropriate areas, techniques and methodologies in the Handbook on Financial 
Sector Assessment and also in any other pertinent documents for financial sector assessment 
relevant in the current and evolving context of the Indian financial sector; 
(ii) Apply relevant methodologies and techniques adapted to Indian system and attempt a 
comprehensive and objective assessment of Indian financial sector, including its development, 
efficiency, competitiveness and prudential aspects; 
(iii) Analyse specific development and stability issues as relevant to India; and  
(iv) Make available its report(s) through Reserve Bank of India/Government of India websites. 
 
Besides being one of the earliest member countries participating voluntarily in the 
Financial Sector Assessment Programme (FSAP), India has been a forerunner in 
comprehensive self assessment of various international financial standards and codes. The 
Reserve Bank has also released a Synthesis Report in May 2002 and a Progress Report in 
January 2005.  The experience has thus far been very encouraging and the financial sector 
reforms have progressed well in recent years, enhancing the soundness of the financial system 
and promoting financial stability.  2
 
 Consistent with this approach, it was considered appropriate and expedient for India to 
undertake a self assessment of financial sector stability and development, using the new 
Handbook on Financial Sector Assessment as the base as also any other pertinent documents 
for financial sector assessment. The handbook was published in September 2005 jointly by the 
World Bank and the International Monetary Fund in the aftermath of the Asian financial crisis 
and their experience in the conduct of assessment in member countries. The Government of 
India, in September 2006 decided in consultation with the Reserve Bank of India to constitute 
the 'Committee on Financial Sector Assessment'.
