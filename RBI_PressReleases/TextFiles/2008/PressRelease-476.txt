Today's Auction of Government Stocks cancelled 
 
The Government of India has decided to cancel, as was done in the past on 
such occasion, today's Government securities auctions. The auction has been 
cancelled in view of the reduction in the repo rate announced by the Reserve Bank of 
India earlier during the day. The Government of India was scheduled to conduct 
auctions of the "New six-year Government Stock" for Rs.6,000 crore and "7.95 per cent 
Government Stock 2032" for Rs.4,000 crore for which bids were already received today 
before the announcement of reduction in repo rate was made. In order to enable the 
market participants to make fresh bids, the Government of India will offer the same 
securities for the same amounts in auctions on a date to be announced later.
