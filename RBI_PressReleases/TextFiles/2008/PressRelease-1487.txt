RBI places on its Website Draft Format for Public 
Comments for reporting of FDIs 
The Reserve Bank of India, today placed on its website for public comments, 
draft format for reporting foreign direct investments (FDIs). In the revised form the 
class of investors has been broadened to include several new entities viz., foreign 
nationals, foreign companies, foreign institutional investors (FIIs), foreign venture 
capital investors (FVCIs) registered with SEBI, foreign trusts, private equity and 
other funds, pension/ provident funds, partnership / proprietorship firms, financial 
institutions, NRIs / PIOs. Secondly, the details of investment received in units of 
venture capital funds from FVCIs are proposed to be separately captured. Thirdly, 
Part B of the form has been modified so as to capture breakup of the details of 
foreign investor class. The date of filing of Part B of the form has been extended 
from June 30 of every year to July 31. 
The Reserve Bank has invited feedback from all interested stakeholders on 
the draft format of FC-GPR. The feedback may be sent to the Chief General 
Manager, Foreign Exchange Department, Reserve Bank of India, 11th Floor, Shahid 
Bhagat Singh Road, Mumbai – 400 001 on or before March 31, 2008. The feedback 
may also be sent by fax (022-22610623/30) or by email 
 It may be noted that Foreign Direct Investments (FDIs) in India are permitted 
under the automatic and government/approval route. An Indian company issuing 
shares and convertible debentures to non-residents under automatic and 
government / approval routes is required to submit the details of the investment in a 
two-stage reporting procedure. In the first stage, receipt of funds has to be reported 
to the Reserve Bank of India within 30 days of receipt. In the second stage, the 
company has to file form FC-GPR with the Reserve Bank within 30 days from the 
date of issue of shares / convertible debentures. 
 In order to capture the details of FDI in a more comprehensive manner, form 
FC-GPR was revised in April 2007, in terms of which the AD Category – I bank in 
India receiving foreign remittance for issue of shares was required to obtain a Know 
Your Customer (KYC) report in respect of the foreign investor from the overseas 
bank remitting the amount. In the wake of the recent policy changes in foreign 
investment and also taking into account the suggestions and feedback received from 
various entities, form FC-GPR has now been further modified.
