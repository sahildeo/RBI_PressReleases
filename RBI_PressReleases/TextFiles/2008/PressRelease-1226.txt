21 Conference of State Finance Secretaries 
st
The 21 Conference of the State Finance Secretaries was held in the 
Reserve Bank of India at Mumbai today.  Finance Secretaries of 22 States 
participated.  Dr. D. Subba Rao, Finance Secretary and other senior officials from 
the Ministry of Finance, Government of India and representatives from 
Comptroller and Auditor General of India, the Controller General of Accounts, 
and the Thirteenth Finance Commission attended the Conference. Dr. Y. V. 
Reddy, Governor, Reserve Bank of India inaugurated the Conference.  
The Reserve Bank has been, since 1997, organising the State Finance 
Secretaries’ Conference twice a year.  The Conference all through has provided 
a very useful forum for interactions among State Finance Secretaries, senior 
officials of Government of India, Planning Commission, Comptroller and Auditor 
General and the Reserve Bank of India.  The State Finance Secretaries play a 
key role in the development process of their respective States and strive to 
achieve transparency, stability, fairness and efficiency in the conduct of fiscal 
policies.  The deliberations in the past Conferences have served to arrive at a 
consensus on various issues in furtherance of better financial management and 
fiscal prudence in the States. 
Today’s Conference aimed to take this consultative process further.  Apart 
from operational issues pertaining to Government transactions, the discussions 
in the Conference primarily focused on issues relating to surplus cash balances 
of the State Governments, market borrowings, budget management and 
management of various funds of the States.
