RBI launches Survey on International Trade in Banking Services The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has launched a Survey on International Trade in Banking Services. In this survey the foreign banks having branches in India as well as the Indian banks having their operation overseas have been advised to provide by March 15, 2008, the information in the survey schedule made available to them. The questionnaire for the survey can be downloaded from the RBI website. Liberalisation of international trade in financial services is one of the important aspects of negotiations on trade in services as a part of the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS). The availability of comparable statistics is a prerequisite for meaningful international negotiations under GATS. In order to develop a proper statistical framework for compiling various information on international trade in banking services, a technical group was constituted in the Reserve Bank of India and based on the recommendations of the Group it was decided to conduct an annual survey among foreign banks in India and Indian banks having overseas operations. The survey is intended to fill in data gaps on international trade in services and to create a consistent and comparable database, keeping in view of the requirements for policy decisions and consistency with international standards : Download the Survey Schedule 1.
