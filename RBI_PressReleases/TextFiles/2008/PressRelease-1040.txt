RBI announces Monetary Measures 
 
       Important developments have taken place in recent weeks with regard to 
inflation. To assess these developments, it is important to recognise the key forces 
at work. The escalation in inflation reported last week mainly reflects the pass-
through of international crude prices to domestic prices effected on June 5, 2008. 
Unlike in some mature economies, however, the pass-through is not occurring on a 
continuous basis in developing economies including India. Thus, the policy 
response to the escalation in crude prices could be somewhat similar to other 
countries but tailored to suit our conditions.  
  Besides oil prices, there are some underlying inflationary pressures 
impacting inflation in India. Inflation, based on variations in the wholesale price 
index (WPI) on a year-on-year basis, increased to 11.05 per cent as on June 7, 
2008 from 7.75 per cent at end-March 2008 and 4.28 per cent a year ago. 
Excluding the fuel sub-group, inflation rose to 9.61 per cent from 5.92 per cent a 
year ago. Excluding fuel and food, inflation was 10.33 per cent as against 6.33 per 
cent in the corresponding period of the preceding year. Inflation based on the 
consumer price index (CPI) for industrial workers (IW) and urban non-manual 
employees (UNME) stood at 7.81 per cent and 6.99 per cent, respectively, on a 
year-on-year basis in April 2008 as compared with 6.67 per cent and 7.74 per cent 
a year ago. Inflation based on CPI for agricultural labourers (AL) and rural 
labourers (RL) stood at 9.11 per cent and 8.84 per cent in May 2008, respectively, 
as compared with 8.22 per cent and 7.90 per cent a year ago. Therefore, it is 
important to recognise that an adjustment of overall aggregate demand on an 
economy-wide basis is warranted to ensure that generalised instability does not 
develop and erodes the hard-earned gains in terms of both outcomes of and 
positive sentiments on India's growth momentum. 
  The urgency of this broader, albeit somewhat painful but timely contraction 
has to be viewed in the context of the new reality of high and volatile energy prices 
not necessarily being a  temporary phenomenon any longer. Monetary policy 
recognises the need to smoothen and enable this adjustment so that inflation 
expectations are contained. The Reserve Bank has been acting pre-emptively from 
April 2008 onwards, keeping in view the lagged effects of such measures on the 
economy. Accordingly, the cash reserve ratio (CRR) was raised by 25 basis points each from the fortnights beginning April 26, May 10 and May 24, 2008. On May 30, 
2008 special market operations were announced to alleviate the binding financing 
constraints faced by public oil companies in importing POL as also to minimise the 
potential adverse consequences for financial markets in which these oil companies 
are important participants. Subsequent to the announcement of the oil price hike, 
the repo rate was increased by 25 basis points on June 11, 2008.  
  This calibrated approach on an ongoing basis and in a timely manner draws 
upon the lessons from managing these challenges in the recent period. Graduated 
monetary policy actions undertaken since September 2004 to withdraw monetary 
accommodation have successfully moderated signs of overheating that emerged in 
2006-07 and continue to have some stabilising influence on the economy. Supply 
management strategies undertaken by the Government of India are also working 
through the economy.  
  However, on a year-on-year basis, money supply (M ) increased by 21.4 per 
3
cent as on June 6, 2008 over and above the growth of 21.0 per cent a year ago 
and well above the indicative projection of 16.5-17.0 per cent set for 2008-09 in the 
Annual Policy Statement of April 2008. Similarly, reserve money increased by 28.5 
per cent on June 13, 2008 as compared with 24.6 per cent a year ago. Aggregate 
deposits rose by 23.2 per cent on a year-on-year basis on June 6, 2008 which is 
above the indicative projection of 17.0 per cent for 2008-09. Non-food credit growth 
was 26.2 per cent and was also above the indicative projection of 20.0 per cent.  
 At this juncture, the overriding priority for monetary policy is to eschew any 
further intensification of inflationary pressures and to firmly anchor inflation 
expectations. Several positive factors that currently exist need to be recognised. 
Relative to several other emerging economies, the Indian economy has, by and 
large, a reasonable supply-demand balance which provides some insulation in 
managing this unprecedented shock from global oil markets. Domestic financial 
markets and institutions have been largely secured against the contagion from the 
unsettled conditions in international financial markets. Furthermore, India is 
somewhat de-coupled from the intensifying global food crisis in view of the 
improvement in domestic agricultural performance. The external sector is strong 
and resilient with modest current account deficits relative to the size of the 
economy and has a comfortable level of foreign exchange reserves. Accordingly, 
the major focus of public policy at the current juncture needs to be on dealing with 
the impact of the escalation of international crude prices in a well-managed and 
smooth adjustment that draws on demonstrated strengths and positive outcomes. 
Moderating and managing aggregate demand so that pressures on prices are not 
intensified is a critical element of this approach.  
  In this regard, monetary policy has to urgently address aggregate demand 
pressures which appear to be strongly in evidence.  First, inflation has increased to 
a 13-year high and inflation expectations have been driven up by unrelenting 
pressures from international commodity prices, particularly crude and metals. 
Second, investment demand continues to be strong, growing in the range of 14-19 
per cent annually since 2002-03 and currently constituting 36 per cent of GDP. This 
is also reflected in the pick-up in the growth of domestic capital goods production in 
April 2008 after some deceleration in January-March. Furthermore, consumption 
demand appears to be reviving the production of consumer goods, with a 
turnaround in the production of durables. Third, with merchandise imports running 
ahead of exports, the trade deficit widened sizeably in 2007-08 and has continued 
to expand in April 2008. Although large oil imports appear to be the main driver, 
non-oil imports have also increased at a considerable pace, contributing more than 
60 per cent of the overall import growth in April 2008 and reflecting the pressure of 
domestic demand. There has also been some tightening of external financing 
conditions in the ongoing global financial turmoil. Fourth, fiscal pressures are 
emerging due to the possibility of enhanced subsidies on account of food, fertiliser 
and POL as well as for financing deferred liabilities relating to farm loan waivers 
with implications for additional pressures on aggregate demand, and with potential 
spillovers into the external sector.  
  The overall stance of monetary policy in 2008-09 was set in terms of 
ensuring a monetary and interest rate environment that accords high priority to 
price stability, well-anchored inflation expectations and orderly conditions in 
financial markets while being conducive to continuation of the growth momentum 
with due emphasis on credit quality and credit delivery. It was resolved to respond 
swiftly on a continuing basis to the evolving constellation of adverse international 
developments and to the domestic situation impinging on inflation expectations, 
financial stability and growth momentum, with both conventional and 
unconventional measures, as appropriate.  
 Consistent with the stance of monetary policy as set out above and on the 
basis of incoming information on domestic and global macroeconomic and financial 
developments, it has been decided to take the following measures:  
(a)  The repo rate under the Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) is increased from 
8.00 per cent to 8.50 per cent with immediate effect. 
 
(b)  The cash reserve ratio (CRR) of the scheduled commercial banks, regional 
rural banks (RRBs), scheduled state co-operative banks and scheduled 
primary (urban) co-operative banks is being increased  by 50 basis points to 
8.75 per cent in two stages, effective from specified fortnights as indicated 
below:  
Effective date CRR on net demand and time 
(i.e., the fortnight beginning from) liabilities  (per cent) 
July 5, 2008 8.50 
July 19, 2008 8.75 
 
 In view of the criticality of anchoring inflation expectations, a continuous 
heightened vigil over ensuing monetary and macroeconomic developments is 
warranted to enable swift responses with appropriate measures as necessary, 
consistent with the monetary policy stance.
