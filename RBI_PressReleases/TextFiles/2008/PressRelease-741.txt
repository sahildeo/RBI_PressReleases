Reserve Bank Cancels the Licence of  
Miraj Urban Co-operative Bank Limited, Miraj, Maharashtra 
In view of the fact that Miraj Urban Co-operative Bank Limited, Miraj, 
Maharashtra, had ceased to be solvent, all efforts to revive it in close consultation 
with the Government of Maharashtra had failed and the depositors were being 
inconvenienced by continued uncertainty, the Reserve Bank of India delivered the 
order cancelling its licence to the bank after the close of business on August 26, 
2008. The Registrar of Co-operative Societies, Maharashtra has also been 
requested to issue an order for winding up the bank and appoint a liquidator for 
the bank.  It may be highlighted that on liquidation, every depositor is entitled to 
repayment of his/her deposits up to a monetary ceiling of Rs. 1,00,000/- (Rupees 
One lakh only) from the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation 
(DICGC) under usual terms and conditions.  
 The bank was granted a licence by Reserve Bank on March 19, 1986 to 
commence banking business.  The statutory inspection of the bank with respect to 
its position as on March 31, 2006 had indicated that its financial position was 
impaired. The bank was issued directions under Section 35 A of the Banking 
Regulation Act, 1949 (As applicable to Co-operative Societies) vide Directive 
UBD. CO. No.BSD.NSB/D-238/12.22.151/2005-06 dated October 27, 2006 
restricting its operations, including placing a ceiling on withdrawal of deposits at 
Rs. 1000/-. 
On the basis of findings of a a quick scrutiny of the books of accounts of 
the bank conducted in March 2007 Reserve Bank issued a requisition dated July 
25, 2007 to the Registrar of Co-operative Societies, Maharashtra State under 
section 110 A of Maharashtra Co-operative Societies Act, 1960 and the Board of 
Directors of the bank was superceded by RCS. 
 The bank was served a notice on August 2, 2007, calling on it to show 
cause as to why the licence granted to it under Section 22 of the Act on March 19, 
1986 to carry on banking business, should not be cancelled and why steps should 
not be taken to wind up the bank. The bank sought some time to improve its 
position and to explore the possibility of merger with any other strong Urban Co-
operative Bank.  
The inspection of the bank with reference to its financial position as on 
March 31, 2008 revealed further deterioration in its financial position. With deposit 
erosion at 49.8% and the absence of any concrete proposal for merger, the 
possibility of revival of the bank was remote. Therefore, the Reserve Bank of India 
took the extreme measure of cancelling licence of the bank in the interest of the 
bank's depositors. With the cancellation of its licence and commencement of 
liquidation proceedings, the process of paying the depositors of Miraj Urban Co-
operative Bank Limited, Miraj, Maharashtra, will be set in motion subject to the 
terms and conditions of the Deposit Insurance Scheme.  
 Consequent to the cancellation of its licence, Miraj Urban Co-operative 
Bank Limited, Miraj, Maharashtra, is prohibited from carrying on ‘banking 
business’ as defined in Section 5(b) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (As 
applicable to Co-operative Societies) including acceptance and repayment of 
deposits.

General Manager, Urban Banks Department, Reserve Bank of India, Mumbai. His
