The Board so far functioned under the Reserve Bank of India (Board for

2005.  
 
It may be noted that the Payment and Settlement Systems Act 2007 (51 of

Supervision of Payment and Settlement Systems Regulations 2008 and Payment

into effect from August 12, 2008. 
 
The Payment and Settlement Systems Act 2007 empowers the Reserve 
Bank of India to regulate and supervise the payment and settlement systems in 
the country. The Act also empowers the Reserve Bank to authorise the setting 
up/continuance of payment and settlement systems, to set standards, to call for 
returns/ information, to audit and inspect, to issue directions, and to impose 
penalties and initiate prosecution for violations of the Act, the Regulations and the 
directions issued by it. The Act provides legal recognition to netting and settlement 
finality and their irrevocability in the event of insolvency.
