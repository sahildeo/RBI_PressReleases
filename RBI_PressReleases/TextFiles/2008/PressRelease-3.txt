Sources of Variation in Foreign Exchange  
Reserves in India: April-September 2008 
Background 
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had, on January 31, 2003, issued a Press Note on 
conclusions of a study conducted by its Department of Economic Analysis and Policy (DEAP) 
on Sources of Accretion to Foreign Exchange Reserves during April-November 2002. 
Subsequent to this, the RBI has been regularly updating and releasing information on ‘Sources 
of Accretion to Foreign Exchange Reserves’ through press releases which are available on the 
RBI website (www.rbi.org.in). 
 
Balance of payments (BoP) data for April-September 2008 are now available. These 
data have been released on RBI website (www.rbi.org.in) on December 31, 2008. On the basis 
of these data, sources of variation in foreign exchange reserves have been compiled. 
 
Sources of Variation in Foreign Exchange Reserves: April-September 2008 
 
During April-September 2008, there was a decline in foreign exchange reserves. The 
main components of reserve change during April-September 2008 are set out in the Table.

 The foreign exchange reserves have declined by an amount of US $ 23,387 million 
during April-September 2008 including the valuation effects as compared with an increase of 
US $ 48,583 million during April-September 2007. On a BoP basis (excluding valuation effects), 
the decline in the foreign exchange reserves was US $ 2,499 million during April-September 
2008. Valuation loss, reflecting the depreciation of major currencies against the US dollar, 
accounted for US $ 20,888 million in total reserves during April-September 2008 as against a 
valuation gain of US $ 8,147 million during the corresponding period of previous year. The 
valuation loss explained 89.3 per cent of decline in reserves during April-September 2008. 
Apart from current account deficits, outflows under FIIs were the other major sources 
contributing to decline in foreign exchange reserves during April-September 2008.
