Sahara India Financial Corporation Ltd (SIFCL) 
Acceptance of Deposits  
 
Reserve Bank of India had, by its order dated June 4, 2008, in exercise of its powers under 
Sections 45K(4) and 45MB(1) prohibited SIFCL from accepting deposits from the public and  
directed SIFCL, inter alia,  to repay the depositors on maturity and comply with the directions 
of RBI.  SIFCL filed a Writ Petition before the Honourable Lucknow Bench of the High Court of 
Judicature at Allahabad and obtained on June 5, 2008, an order staying the operation of the 
order dated June 4, 2008 issued by RBI.  In the Special Leave Petition filed by RBI on June 6, 
2008, the Honourable Supreme Court by its order dated June 9, 2008, observed that RBI had 
complied with the rules of natural justice while passing the order dated June 4, 2008, but felt 
that it was appropriate to provide a personal hearing to SIFCL and pass a fresh order. 
 
Pursuant to the directions of the Honourable Supreme Court, personal hearing was given to 
the officials of SIFCL on June 12, 2008 and June 16, 2008.  After taking into consideration all 
the oral and written submissions made by SIFCL, on  being satisfied that to protect the 
interests of depositors and in public interest, it is necessary and expedient so to do, in 
exercise of the powers vested in RBI under Section 45K(3) of RBI Act, 1934, RBI  passed a 
fresh  order containing the following directions: 
 
“(i) SIFCL is hereby directed not to accept any new  deposit which matures beyond 
June 30, 2011 and  to  stop accepting  installments of existing deposit accounts also 
with effect from that date.  The Aggregate Liability to Depositors (ALD) will not exceed 
Rs.15,000 crore (rounded off) as of June 30, 2009, Rs.12,600 crore (rounded off)  as 
of June  30, 2010 and Rs.9,000 crore (rounded off) as of June 30, 2011.   
 
(ii) SIFCL shall repay the deposits as and when they mature and bring the ALD to zero 
on or before June 30, 2015. 
 
(iii) SIFCL shall not treat non-payment of installments under any running daily  deposit  
or other recurring deposit schemes by depositors after June 30, 2011, as a default by 
depositor and SIFCL shall be liable to pay the agreed rate of interest on the amounts 
actually held by it for the entire term of the deposit as if there was no default.  
(iv) SIFCL shall continue to comply with the requirements of directed investments 
under paragraph 6 of RNBC Directions with respect to its ALD. 
 
(v) SIFCL shall ensure 100% compliance with KYC norms for all new deposits. 
 
(vi) SIFCL shall subject to (i) (ii) (iii) above,  strictly comply with the requirements of all 
the applicable provisions of the RBI Act, the directions, guidelines, instructions and 
circulars issued by RBI there-under from time to time until such time as all the deposits 
are repaid with interest in full. For repaying the depositors, SIFCL shall first apply its 
income and investments other than the investments it is required to maintain under 
paragraph 6 of RNBC Directions.  
 
 (vii) SIFCL shall, without prejudice to the above, be entitled to carry on its other 
business activities in accordance with law. 
 
(viii) SIFCL shall submit a comprehensive business plan before the close of business 
th
on 16 August 2008.” 
 
RBI has incorporated in its order, the offer made during the personal hearing by the Managing 
Worker & Chairman of SIFCL and the senior executives of SIFCL. Keeping in view quality 
corporate governance, they offered to  (a) reconstitute the Board of Directors of SIFCL within 
a period of thirty days from June 16, 2008 so that  the Board shall consist of 50% of such 
independent directors as are acceptable to Reserve Bank of India; (b) get the appointment of 
these  independent directors  ratified at the ensuing Annual General Meeting of the company 
and to continue the said arrangement till such time as all depositors are repaid in full;  and (c) 
appoint  statutory auditors from  the panel of auditors suggested by Reserve Bank of India at 
the ensuing Annual General Meeting of the company envisaged by August 31, 2008 and  to 
continue to appoint statutory auditors each year from the panel suggested by Reserve Bank of 
India till all depositors are repaid in full.
