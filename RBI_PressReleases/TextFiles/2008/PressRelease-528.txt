Statement by Dr. Duvvuri Subbarao, Governor, Reserve Bank of India 
 
 
1. The fundamentals of the Indian economy have been strong and continue to be 
strong. 
 
2. The Indian banking system is sound, well capitalised and well regulated. 
 
3. Our forex and money markets have been functioning in an orderly manner. 
 
4. As per information with RBI, Indian banks do not have any direct exposure to sub-
prime mortgages.  The banking sector, through its overseas branches, has some 
exposure to distressed financial instruments and troubled financial institutions.  But this 
exposure is part of the normal course of their business and is quite small relative to the 
size of their overall business. 
 
5. What we are witnessing today in the Indian markets is an indirect, knock-on effect of 
the global financial situation.  This is only a reflection of the uncertainty and anxiety in 
the global financial markets. 
 
6. The Reserve Bank of India has taken action to inject liquidity into the system as 
warranted by the situation.  We are monitoring the situation on a continuous basis, and 
stand ready to take appropriate effective and swift action. 
 
7. Once again, I want to reiterate that our banking system is stable and sound.  There is 
no reason for any anxiety or uncertainty.
