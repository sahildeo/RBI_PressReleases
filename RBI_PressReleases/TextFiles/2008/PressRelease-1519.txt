Government of Punjab signs MoU 
with Reserve Bank of India 
 
The Government of Punjab and the Reserve Bank of India have, on March 7, 
2008 signed a Memorandum of Understanding with regard to Urban Cooperative Banks 
in the State of Punjab. Consequent upon this, a State level Task Force on Urban Co-
operative Banks (TAFCUB) has been constituted for Punjab. Dr J Sadakkdulla, 
Regional Director for Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Union Territory of 
Chandigarh, Reserve Bank of India, is the Chairman of the TAFCUB and Shri Viswajeet 
Khanna, Registrar of Cooperative Societies, Government of Punjab, is its Co-Chairman. 
The other members of the TAFCUB include a representative, each from State and 
National Federation of Urban Cooperative Banks, a nominee of State Government of 
Punjab and a representative of Urban Banks Department, Reserve Bank of India, 
Central Office, Mumbai. The first meeting of the TAFCUB will be held shortly.  
 
Earlier, similar MoUs have been signed with the Governments of the States of 
Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttaranchal, 
Chattisgarh, Goa, Maharashtra, Haryana, National Capital Territory of Delhi, West 
Bengal, Assam and Tripura.  As part of its developmental role, the Reserve Bank would 
also be assessing the training, computerisation needs of the Urban Co-operative 
Bank/s in the State of Punjab with the objective of upgrading their human resources 
skills and technological infrastructure so that they improve their operational efficiency 
and quality of management information systems.  
 
It may be recalled that in the Mid-Term Review of Annual Policy announced in 
October 2004, the Reserve Bank had announced that a Vision Document for Urban Co-
operative Banks would be prepared. Accordingly, the Reserve Bank placed in public 
domain a draft Vision Document in March 2005. As the Urban Co-operative Banks are 
subject to dual control by the Reserve Bank and the State Governments, the Vision 
Document envisaged the signing of MoU between State Governments and the Reserve 
Bank of India to put in place an arrangement through which there is a convergence on 
the approach and remedial actions required to be taken for facilitating the development 
of the sector. The Vision Document also proposed the constitution of a State level Task 
Force for Urban Co-operative Banks with representatives of State Government, 
State/National Federation of Urban Cooperative Banks and the Reserve Bank of India 
as its members, for the purpose of identifying the potentially viable urban co-op. banks 
and drawing up a time-bound action plan for their revival by setting specific monitorable 
milestones.
