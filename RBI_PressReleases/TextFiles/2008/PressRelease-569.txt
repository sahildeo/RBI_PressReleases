Investment by FIIs under PIS :  
M/s Dynamatic Technologies Limited 
 
 The Reserve Bank of India has today notified that under the Portfolio 
Investment Scheme (PIS), Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) can now purchase 
equity shares and convertible debentures of M/s Dynamatic Technologies Limited, 
through primary markets and stock exchanges in India. The purchases can be made 
up to 100 per cent of the paid up capital of the company, as it has passed a 
resolution to this effect at the Board of Directors' level and at the Extra-Ordinary 
General Body Meeting. The purchases of equity shares by a single FII/Security and 
Exchange Board of India approved sub-account of a registered FII in the above 
company should, however, not exceed 10 per cent (ten per cent) of the paid-up 
equity capital of the companies. 
 
 The revised FII limit of 100 per cent is within the overall 100 per cent FDI limit 
applicable to the company.
