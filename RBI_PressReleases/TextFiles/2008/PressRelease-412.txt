Special Fixed Repo Rate under Liquidity Adjustment Facility 
     
The Reserve Bank of India shall conduct a special fixed rate term repo at 8 per cent per annum 
against eligible securities for Rs.15,630 crore on October 31, 2008, due for reversal on November 14, 
2008, with a view to enabling banks to meet the liquidity requirements of mutual funds either on 
incremental or on rollover basis. Of the outstanding amount of Rs. 7675 crore as on Oct 29, 2008, Rs. 
3305 is due for redemption today. 
 
It may be recalled that the Reserve Bank of India had announced earlier that it would conduct the 
special fixed rate term repo under Liquidity Adjustment Facility every day until further notice up to a 
cumulative amount of Rs 20,000 crore and that additional liquidity support to the extent of up to 0.5 per 
cent of their NDTL, can be availed by banks exclusively for the purpose of meeting requirements of 
mutual funds.
