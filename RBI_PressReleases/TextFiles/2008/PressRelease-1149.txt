RBI releases Draft Guidelines on NBFC-ND-SI  
regarding Prudential Norms for Public Comments 
 
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) today placed on its website draft 
guidelines in respect of capital adequacy, liquidity and disclosure norms of non-
deposit taking, systemically important non-banking financial companies (NBFC-
ND-SI) for public comments. In keeping with its consultative approach, the 
Reserve Bank has placed the draft guidelines on its website (www.rbi.org.in) for 
study by a wider audience. Comments/suggestions may be sent to the Chief 
General Manager-in-Charge, Department of Non-Banking Supervision, Reserve 
Bank of India, Central Office, 2nd Floor, Centre-I, World Trade Centre, Cuffe 
Parade, Mumbai-400005 or by email at the earliest but within 30 days of the 
publication of the guidelines.  
It may be recalled that an announcement was made in Annual Monetary 
Policy Statement of 2008-09 (paragraph 216) that  “it is observed that many 
systemically important non deposit taking NBFCs are highly leveraged and  use 
short term sources to fund their activities. In light of international developments 
and increasing exposure to these systemically important NBFCs, it has now been 
decided to review the regulations in respect of capital adequacy, liquidity and 
disclosure norms. Revised instructions will be issued by May 31, 2008.”
