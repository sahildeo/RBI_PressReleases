RBI's Rajbhasha Shield Awards Ceremony 
 Dr. Y.V. Reddy, Governor, Reserve Bank of India while awarding the shields for the year 2006-
2007, said that one should not hesitate to use Hindi even if one did not get the words fluently. Getting the 
award means greater responsibility to achieve more usage of Hindi in all spheres. The mission of 
financial literacy started by us last year has progressed well due to the co-operation of all and usage of 
Hindi has played a significant role in this.  
 Shri V. Leeladhar, Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India while complimenting the prize 
winning banks and financial institutions observed that while Hindi may not be essential for pure banking 
work, it is most ideally suited for reaching out to the common person. He said that he is not subscribing to 
the translated version of Hindi language but one that is spoken in the nook-and-corner of the country. Let 
us start work in Hindi, even if it is not perfect, that itself would be sufficient to inspire all to work in that 
language. 
  The annual Reserve Bank Rajbhasha Shield was instituted in 1980 to encourage public sector 
banks to use Hindi in their day-to-day work. The Reserve Bank also conducts a competition for the house 
journals of banks and financial institutions. The Reserve Bank has also started an Inter-Bank Hindi Essay 
Competition from 2002-03. 
 Earlier, Shri V.K. Sharma, Executive Director, RBI welcomed the Chief Executives of banks and 
financial institutions. Shri Prabal Sen, Principal Chief General Manager, Department of Administration 
and Personnel Management, RBI, proposed a vote of thanks. Ms. Roopam Misra, General Manager, 
Rajbhasha Department, RBI compered the programme.  
 The function was attended by chairmen and other senior executives of banks and financial 
institutions.
