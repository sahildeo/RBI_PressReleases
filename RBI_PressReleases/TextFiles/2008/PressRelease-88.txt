Reserve Bank Cancels the Licence of Goregaon Co-operative Urban 
Bank Ltd., Goregaon, District Raigad, Maharashtra 
In view of the fact that the Goregaon Co-operative Urban Bank Ltd., Goregaon, District 
Raigad, Maharashtra, had ceased to be solvent, all efforts to revive it in close consultation with 
the Government of Maharashtra had failed and the depositors were being inconvenienced by 
continued uncertainty, the Reserve Bank of India delivered the order cancelling its licence to the 
bank after the close of business on December 2, 2008. The Registrar of Co-operative Societies, 
Maharashtra has also been requested to issue an order for winding up the bank and appoint a 
liquidator for the bank. It may be highlighted that on liquidation, every depositor is entitled to 
repayment of his/her deposits up to a monetary ceiling of Rs.1,00,000/- (Rupees One lakh only) 
from the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) under usual terms and 
conditions.  
The bank was granted a licence by Reserve Bank on December 10, 1986 to commence 
banking business.  The statutory inspection of the bank with respect to its position as on March 
31, 2007 had indicated that its financial position was impaired. Based on the findings of the 
inspection as on March 31, 2007 supervisory action was initiated against the bank. The Reserve 
Bank of India issued directions under Section 35 A of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (As 
applicable to Co-operative Societies) vide Directive UBD.No.CO.BSD.NSB-
1/RSB.96/12.22.072/2007-08 dated November 01, 2007 restricting its operations, including 
placing a ceiling on withdrawal of deposits at Rs.1000/-. 
The Reserve Bank of India issued a notice to the bank on November 03, 2007 asking it to 
show cause as to why the licence granted to it to conduct banking business should not be 
cancelled. The reply to the show cause notice was examined and it was observed that the bank 
did not have any viable plan of action for its revival.  
In the absence of any viable proposal for turn around and achieve the required regulatory 
prescriptions, the possibility of revival of the bank was remote. Therefore, the Reserve Bank of 
India took the extreme measure of canceling the licence of the bank in the interest of the bank's 
depositors. With the cancellation of its licence and commencement of liquidation proceedings, 
the process of paying the depositors of the Goregaon Co-operative Urban Bank Ltd., Goregaon, 
District Raigad, Maharashtra, will be set in motion, subject to the terms and conditions of the 
Deposit Insurance Scheme.   
Consequent to the cancellation of its licence, the Goregaon Co-operative Urban Bank 
Ltd., Goregaon, District Raigad, Maharashtra, is prohibited from carrying on ‘banking business’ 
as defined in Section 5(b) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (AACS) including acceptance and 
repayment of deposits.

Manager, Urban Banks Department, Reserve Bank of India, Mumbai. His contact details are as
