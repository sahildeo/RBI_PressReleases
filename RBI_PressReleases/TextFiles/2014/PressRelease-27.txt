RBI releases 'Quarterly Statistics on Deposits and Credit of
Scheduled Commercial Banks: June 2014'
The Reserve Bank of India today released the time series web publication
‘Quarterly data on Deposits and Credit of Scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs)’ for
the quarter ended June 2014. The data can be accessed at
http://dbie.rbi.org.in/DBIE/dbie.rbi?site=publications#!3 through its website
http://dbie.rbi.org.in. The data series pertain to aggregate deposits and gross bank
credit of SCBs including regional rural banks (RRBs), based on data reported by
banks through Basic Statistical Return (BSR)-7. The data are classified according to
states, districts, centres (having three or more branches), population groups and
bank groups.
Highlights:
· Growth in aggregate deposits and gross bank credit decelerated to 11.9 per
cent and 12.9 per cent, respectively in June 2014 from 13.5 per cent and 13.2
per cent, respectively a year ago. The credit-deposit (CD) ratio for all SCBs
was 77.2 per cent as at end-June 2014.
· Aggregate deposits decelerated for branches in ‘urban’ and ‘metro’ centres.
However, gross bank credit accelerated in ‘metro’ centres, but decelerated
across other population groups. The CD ratio for metropolitan centres reached
92.8 per cent. For other population groups, CD ratio was lower than the all-
India level.
· Public sector banks together contributed 73.9 per cent share in aggregate
deposits and 72.5 per cent share in gross bank credit followed by private
sector banks (18.7 per cent and 19.9 per cent, respectively) at end-June 2014.
· The CD ratio of four States/UTs, viz., Tamil Nadu (122.3 per cent), Chandigarh
(115.7 per cent), Andhra Pradesh (112.3 per cent) and Telangana (108.5 per
cent) was above 100 per cent.
