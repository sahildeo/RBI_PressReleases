Reserve Bank of India cancels the Licence of  
The Mirzapur Urban Co-operative Bank Ltd., Mirzapur (Uttar Pradesh) 
In view of the fact that The Mirzapur Urban Co-operative Bank Ltd., Mirzapur 
(Uttar Pradesh), had ceased to be solvent, all efforts to revive it, had failed and the 
depositors were being inconvenienced by continued uncertainty, the Reserve Bank of 
India [RBI] delivered the order cancelling its licence to the bank and the same is 
effective from the close of business as on September 11, 2014. The Registrar of Co-
operative Societies, Uttar Pradesh has also been requested to issue an order for 
winding up the bank and appoint a liquidator for the bank. It may be highlighted that 
on liquidation, every depositor is entitled to repayment of his/her deposits up to a 
monetary ceiling of `1,00,000/- (Rupees One lakh only) from the Deposit Insurance 
and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) under usual terms and conditions. 
  The bank was granted a licence by RBI on February 9, 1990 to commence 
banking business. The latest statutory inspection of the bank conducted under 
Section 35 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (AACS) with reference to its financial 
position as on March 31, 2013, interalia, revealed that the real or exchangeable value 
of paid-up share capital and reserves of the bank was assessed at (-) ` 325.39 lakh 
with erosion in the deposits to the extent of 27.03%. The bank’s CRAR was assessed 
at (-) 149.8% as against the regulatory requirement of 9%, accumulated losses 
reported by the bank as on March 31, 2013 stood at ` 217.09 lakh with gross and net 
NPAs as on March 31, 2013 assessed at ` 421.67 lakh (84.64% of the gross loans 
and advances) and ` 256.37 lakh (77.01% of the net advances), respectively. The net 
loss of the bank was assessed at ` 334.27 lakh during 2012-2013. In view of the 
large amount of NPAs, substantial accumulated losses, poor chances of recovery for 
improvement in financial health of the bank, revival prospects of the bank in the near 
future are bleak. 
  The bank’s statutory inspection with reference to its financial position as on 
March 31, 2009 revealed that the bank did not meet the minimum regulatory 
requirement of 9% CRAR as the same was 3.83%. The bank had violated prescribed 
regulatory ceiling for single borrower, for unsecured advances in a large number of 
cases. The Gross and Net NPAs were very high and stood at 54.14% and 48.74% 
respectively. The bank was not adhering to IRAC norms and KYC norms.  As 
recommended by TAFCUB, the bank was advised to submit an action plan within six 
weeks for revival and step up recovery efforts. The financial indicators of the bank, 
however, continued to deteriorate as was revealed during inspections conducted with 
reference to its financial position as on March 31, 2009 to March 31, 2012. The bank 
was issued operational instructions as per TAFCUB recommendations on December 
14, 2011 and was advised to submit an action plan for its revival duly approved by 
the Board of Directors. The bank’s management was also advised that in case it

would not be possible for the bank to achieve the viability norms within the specified 
period as mentioned above, it may explore the possibility of merger of the bank with a 
sound co-operative bank or convert the bank into a society by repaying the deposits 
of non-members. Taking into consideration the recommendations of 17th TAFCUB 
meeting, the bank was issued additional operational instructions on November 27, 
2012 inter-alia not to increase its aggregate advances and deposits beyond the level 
of advances and deposits as on November 26, 2012. These instructions also 
prohibited the bank from permitting premature withdrawal of term deposits, taking on 
fresh high risk weighted exposures,  sanction of fresh unsecured loans and required 
the bank to invest in assets carrying lower risk weights, besides augmenting its 
capital. 
  As on March 31, 2013, the erosion of deposit had reached the level of 27.03%. 
In view of the above, the bank was placed under all-inclusive directions under 
Section 35A of BR Act, which was extended till September 11, 2014.  
  Serious deficiencies as mentioned above revealed that the affairs of the bank 
were being conducted in a manner detrimental to the interests of the depositors. The 
bank did not comply with the provisions of Sections 11(1), 18, 22(3) (a), 22(3) (b) and 
31 of the Act, ibid. The bank was, therefore, issued a show cause notice vide letter 
dated February 13, 2014 to show cause as to why the licence granted to it to carry on 
banking business under Section 22 of the Act, ibid, on July 11, 1986 should not be 
cancelled and the bank be taken into liquidation. The bank submitted its reply to the 
SCN vide letter dated March 28, 2014 which was examined but was not found to be 
satisfactory. Not only are the bank’s replies to the show cause notice untenable but 
also it has not made any satisfactory proposal for revival / improvement in the 
functioning of the bank. A merger proposal with respect to the bank was received in 
June 2014 which was also not found viable, as it did not meet the regulatory 
requirements. As such, there is no viable merger proposal under consideration. 
  Therefore, RBI took the extreme measure of cancelling the licence of the bank 
in the interest of bank's depositors. With the cancellation of licence and 
commencement of liquidation proceedings, the process of paying the depositors of 
The Mirzapur Urban Co-operative Bank Ltd., Mirzapur (Uttar Pradesh) the amount 
insured as per the DICGC Act, will be set in motion subject to the terms and 
conditions of the Deposit Insurance Scheme. 
  Consequent to the cancellation of its licence, The Mirzapur Urban Co-
operative Bank Ltd., Mirzapur (Uttar Pradesh) is prohibited from carrying on ‘banking 
business’ as defined in section 5(b) of the Act.
