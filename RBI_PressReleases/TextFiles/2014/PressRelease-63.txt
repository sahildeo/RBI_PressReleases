The Reserve Bank of India today released, on its website, the data on the
performance of non-financial private corporate business sector during first quarter of
2014-15 (April- June 2014).
The data compiled are based on the abridged financial results of 2,755 listed
non-government non-financial companies. To enable comparison, similar data
pertaining to Q1:2013-14 and Q4:2013-14 are also presented. Coverage of
companies in different quarters varies to some extent, depending on the date of
declaration of quarterly results; however, it is not expected to alter the aggregate
position significantly. ‘Explanatory Notes’ containing the brief methodology followed
for compilation of data and the glossary of terms are given at the end.
Highlights:
· Aggregate sales growth (Y-o-Y) improved in Q1:2014-15 from that of Q4:2013-
14. Improvement in sales growth was observed only in manufacturing sector,
while it contracted in the services (non-IT) sector. Sales growth declined in the
IT sector.
· While the overall sales growth of the companies with annualised sales more
than`5 billion improved, sales growth of companies with annualised sales less
than `5 billion continued to contract.
· Overall expenditure growth increased due to higher growth in raw material
expenses although growth in staff cost declined. Earnings before Interest, Tax,
Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA) growth noticeably increased at the
aggregate level.
· Y-o-Y growth in interest expenses dropped at the aggregate level and also
across all the sectors. Interest coverage ratio (Earnings before Interest and
Tax/Interest expenses) increased as compared with the Q1 of the previous
year.
· Pricing power as measured by EBITDA margin increased at the aggregate
level as well as in all the sectors though this increase was more pronounced in
the services (non-IT) sector. It remained almost stable for the IT sector and
improved to some extent for the manufacturing sector. Net profit margins also
improved slightly at aggregate level along with the IT and manufacturing
sectors but it improved at noticeable level for the services (non-IT) sector.
