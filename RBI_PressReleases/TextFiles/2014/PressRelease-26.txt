Financial Year 2014-15 (October 2014 - March 2015) 
It has been decided, in consultation with the Government of India, that the

The Reserve Bank may trigger fresh floatation of market loans when the

The Reserve Bank would retain the flexibility to revise the limits at any time, in 
consultation with the Government of India, taking into consideration the prevailing 
circumstances.  
The interest rate on WMA/overdraft will be:  
a) WMA: Repo Rate  
b) Overdraft: Two per cent above the Repo Rate  
The minimum balance required to be maintained by the Government of India

of Government of India's financial year and on June 30, i.e., closure of the annual 
accounts of the Reserve Bank of India and Rs.10 crore on other days. 
  As per the provisions of the agreement dated March 26, 1997 between the 
Government of India and the Reserve Bank of India, overdrafts beyond ten 
consecutive working days will not be allowed.
