Indicative Quantum of Market Borrowings by State Governments  
for the Quarter October-December 2014 
 
The Reserve Bank of India, in consultation with the State Governments, 
announces that the indicative quantum of total market borrowings by the State 
Governments and the Union Territory of Puducherry, for the quarter October-
December 2014, is expected to be in the range of ` 60,000 crore to ` 70,000 crore. 
The amount will be raised through auction of State Development Loans (SDLs) 
generally on the second and fourth Tuesdays of the month. RBI would endeavour to 
conduct the auctions in a calibrated manner and distribute the borrowings evenly 
throughout the quarter. The actual amount of borrowings would be intimated by way 
of press release two/three days prior to the actual auction day and would depend on 
the requirement of the State Governments, approval from the Government of India 
under Article 293(3) of the Constitution of India and the market conditions.
