India’s External Debt as at the end of June 2014 
As per the standard practice, with a lag of one quarter, India's external debt 
statistics for the quarters ending March and June are released by the Reserve Bank 
of India and those for the quarters ending September and December by the Ministry 
of Finance, Government of India. The external debt data as at end-June 2014 in 
Rupees and US dollar terms as well as revised data for the earlier quarters are set 
out in Statements 1 and 2, respectively. The major developments relating to India’s 
external debt as at end-June 2014 are presented in the following paragraphs. 
Highlights 
With a modest level of current account deficit (CAD) and sharp rise in non-
debt creating flows in Q1 of 2014-15, India’s external debt at US$ 450.1 billion rose 
marginally by 1.8 per cent over end-March 2014. The share of short-term debt in total 
debt in terms of both original maturity and residual maturity declined further over end-
March 2014 as investment of FIIs in Government treasury bills and other instruments 
showed a decline in Q1 of 2014-15.  
The major developments relating to India’s external debt as at end-June 2014 are 
set out below: 
• India’s external debt, as at end-June 2014, was placed at US$ 450.1 billion 
showing an increase of US$ 7.9 billion or 1.8 per cent over the level at end-
March 2014 (Table 1).  
• Of the total absolute increase of US$ 7.9 billion in total external debt, a marginal 
increase of about US$ 0.4 billion during the quarter was on account of valuation 
change,  reflecting a marginal depreciation of the US dollar against the Indian 
rupee and other major currencies. 
• The increase in total external debt was primarily on account of rise in commercial 
borrowings by US$ 6.3 billion over end-March 2014. Outstanding NRI deposits 
with a rise of US$ 2.4 billion over end-March 2014 were the second largest 
source of increase in India’s external debt.   
• In terms of major components, the share of commercial borrowings continued to 
be the highest at 34.2 per cent of total external debt, followed by NRI deposits 
(23.6 per cent) and short-term debt based on original maturity (19.5 per cent). 
• The share of short-term debt in total debt witnessed a decline over the preceding 
quarter as well as the corresponding quarter of the previous year. Short-term 
debt at US$ 87.9 billion accounted for 19.5 per cent of the total external debt as 
at end-June 2014 as compared to 20.2 per cent at end-March 2014.

• With decline in short-term debt, the ratio of short-term debt (original maturity) to 
foreign exchange reserves declined to 27.8 per cent as at end-June 2014 from 
29.3 per cent as at end-March 2014. Similarly, on residual maturity basis, the 
ratio of short-term debt to foreign exchange reserves worked out to 55.3 per cent 
at end-June 2014 as compared with 57.4 per cent at end-March 2014 (Table 2). 
• The US dollar denominated debt continued to be the largest component of India’s 
external debt with a share of 61.1 per cent as at end-June 2014, followed by 
Indian rupee (22.1 per cent), SDR (6.8 per cent), Japanese Yen (4.9 per cent) 
and Euro (3.1 per cent). 
• Government (Sovereign) external debt stood at US$ 85.4 billion as at end-June 
2014 as against US$ 81.5 billion as at end-March 2014 (Table 3). The shares of 
Government and non-Government external debt in the total external debt were 
19.0 per cent and 81.0 per cent, respectively, as at end-June 2014.
