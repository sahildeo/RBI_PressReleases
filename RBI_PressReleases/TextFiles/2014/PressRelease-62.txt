RBI Working Paper Series 9:
Business Cycles Approach to Dynamic Provisioning: An Indian Case Study
The Reserve Bank of India today placed on its website a Working Paper titled
“Business Cycles Approach to Dynamic Provisioning: An Indian Case Study” under the
Reserve Bank of India Working Paper Series*. This paper is authored by Tulasi Gopinath
and Thangjam Rajeshwar Singh.
Regulation of banks is increasingly becoming inter-temporal in spirit with
increasing emphasis on through-the-cycle approach as against the point-in-time
approach. Provisioning is one of the regulatory tools available at the disposal of the
regulators. Globally, efforts are underway to adopt a forward-looking framework for the
application of provisioning. The Reserve Bank had issued a Discussion Paper on
dynamic provisioning in March 2012, proposing a methodology for the conduct of
dynamic provisions in India
(http://rbi.org.in/Scripts/PublicationReportDetails.aspx?ID=660).
Basically, there are two generic models for dynamic provisioning viz., banking
models employing banking data; and macro-economic models involving GDP data. This
paper belongs to the latter genre. The advantages associated with relying on GDP rather
than on credit are: it is empirically found that credit trails GDP. Hence, targeting GDP
could tend to be more countercyclical than targeting credit. Further, from an EME’s
perspective in general and Indian perspective in particular, credit growth per se need not
signal emerging financial imbalances due to structural factors.  The paper uses quarterly
data for the period of Q1:1996-97 to Q3:2013-14. Based on detailed analysis of Indian
business cycles, the paper proposes a model capable of identifying various phases of
growth of real output, warranting activation/deactivation of dynamic provisions. For this
purpose, a threshold based on average potential output growth rate is determined.
Employing the simplest and the most popular method for estimation of potential output,
the paper empirically estimates such potential output threshold at 7 per cent.
In back testing the model, the paper finds evidence that the model-based signals
for the activation/deactivation of dynamic provisions by and large supported the timing of
judgment-based increase or decrease in risk weight(RW)/provisions on the standard
assets of certain identified sensitive sectors introduced by the Reserve Bank  since
December 2004.
