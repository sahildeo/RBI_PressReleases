RBI discusses Modelling and Forecasting Techniques at its
th
8 Statistics Day Conference
th
The Reserve Bank of India organised the 8 Statistics Day Conference on
September 25, 2014. The theme of the conference was Modelling and Forecasting.
Statistics Day is observed in India at the national level to commemorate the sterling
contribution of Prof. Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis to statistics and the Indian statistical
system.
Distinguished statisticians and academicians from India and abroad, such as,
Prof. Peter Robinson, London School of Economics; Prof. Andrew Harvey, Cambridge
University; Dr. Tucker McElroy, US Census Bureau; Dr. Sveinbjorn Blöndal, OECD; Prof.
S. K. Upadhyay, Banaras Hindu University; and Dr. Rituparna Sen, Indian Statistical
Institute, spoke in the conference. The conference deliberated upon the advanced
statistical techniques of modelling and forecasting in the face growing challenges of
policy making. Recent initiatives by the Reserve Bank in addressing data gaps and
information management were also highlighted.
Dr. Raghuram Rajan, Governor, in his inaugural address, highlighted the
persistent nature of inflation in India and alluded to a host of conceptual issues in
statistical analysis for predicting inflation. With regard to the data gaps in policy making in
the Reserve Bank, Governor underscored the need to improve the quality, quantity and
scope of data on macroeconomic changes and identified 5 key data areas that need to
be addressed on a priority basis. These are: (i) employment - as available data on
employment from various sources suffer from coverage, timeliness and
comprehensiveness, Governor suggested that National Sample Survey Organisation
(NSSO) undertake this survey, possibly on a monthly interval at par with other countries,
in active collaboration with the Reserve Bank; (ii) economic activity indicators of
construction -  as this sector has a close link with interest rate changes, availability of
data on index of land prices, number of house start-ups, wage and house price trend in
construction are critical; (iii) consumption demand – one can use the data on credit card
usage notwithstanding keeping in view its limitations; (iv) producer price index (PPI) - a
PPI helps in understanding the pass-through mechanism of price from producer to final
consumer, which is not possible to segregate in the existing WPI or CPI; and (v) financial
stability – a major data gap is non-availability of comprehensive data on non-bank
financial sector and extent of hedging by corporates.
Prof. Peter Robinson in the Mahalanobis lecture reminisced about the role and
contributions of Prof. Mahalanobis in the development of Statistics and Statistical
Systems as a whole. He recounted how Prof. Mahalanobis’ ideas laid the foundation of
2
many statistical developments including bootstrapping. Drawing from Mahalanobis-D , he
showed how a similar concept is still so relevant in time series and spatial econometric
modelling.  In this context, he highlighted the recent developments in econometrics on
how to deal with dependence and non-stationarity in time series and spatial data.

In the keynote address, Prof. Andrew Harvey highlighted the nature of
unobserved components models which are increasingly used in macroeconomic policy
analysis and forecasting with application to inflation data. In order to forecast volatility, an
area which has gained more prominence after the 2008 crisis, he introduced a new class
of nonlinear time series models, called the dynamic conditional score models. He
showed how such models could be successfully used to capture the evolving correlation
or association across variables.
While highlighting the latest development on seasonal adjustment methodologies,
Dr. Tucker McElroy emphasised the need for capturing the seasonality in a multivariate
signal extraction framework using latent dynamic factor models. In a post-mortem
analysis, Dr. Blondal critically examined the properties of the OECD GDP growth
forecast errors during and after the financial crisis. In order to minimise forecast errors,
he stressed the need to focus more closely on global linkages, structural policy settings
and the financial system, and recommended paying more attention to the balance of
risks as to the point forecasts.
The Bayesian world of statistics and decision making in the context of forecasting
was the topic of Prof. Upadhyay’s lecture. As an illustration, he showed how Bayesian
method of reasoning can be successfully integrated in the state-space framework. Dr.
Rituparna Sen explained how in a unified framework the time and maturity components
of yield curve can be studied with functional data analysis.
Earlier, while welcoming the participants, Shri Deepak Mohanty, Executive
Director, noted that in the aftermath of 2008 global crisis, the information needs have
increased considerably, and information management and dissemination has become
technologically more challenging
(http://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/content/pdfs/EDDMSD290914.pdf). He highlighted how the
Reserve Bank in response is reviewing its current system of data collection,
dissemination and management processes, and exploring the feasibility of moving
towards granular, multi-purpose data collection and more integrated and structured data
production processes. In this context, he also highlighted the recent efforts of processing
account level credit information automatically through the adoption of appropriate
straight-through processing systems, and how granular data analysis is found useful for
policy formulation.
The deliberations in the conference provide inputs for crafting the agenda of
future statistical work in the Reserve Bank.
