Mid-Quarter Monetary Policy Review: December 2010 
Monetary Measures 
 It has been decided to: 
• retain the repo rate at 6.25 per cent and the reverse repo rate at 5.25 per cent 
under the Reserve Bank’s liquidity adjustment facility (LAF); 
• retain the cash reserve ratio (CRR) at 6.0 per cent of net demand and time 
liabilities (NDTL) of scheduled banks. 
Liquidity Measures 
 It has been decided to:  
• first, reduce the statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) of scheduled commercial banks 
(SCBs) from 25 per cent of their NDTL to 24 per cent with effect from 
December 18, 2010; 
• second, conduct open market operation (OMO) auctions for purchase of 
government securities for an aggregate amount of ` 48,000 crore in the next 
one month, the schedule for which is being issued separately. 
 The above two measures are expected to inject liquidity on an enduring basis 
of the order of ` 48,000 crore.  
 Given the permanent reduction in the SLR by one per cent of NDTL, the 
additional liquidity support under the LAF announced by the Reserve Bank on 
November 29, 2010 will now be available up to the extent of 1.0 per cent (instead of 
2.0 per cent) of the NDTL of SCBs from December 18, 2010 to January 28, 2011. 
Global Economy 
 There have been significant global and domestic macroeconomic 
developments since the announcement of the Second Quarter Review of Monetary 
Policy on November 2, 2010. A slow recovery and persistent unemployment 
motivated another round of quantitative easing in the US. However, recent data 
show some signs of improvement, especially in respect of real GDP and consumer 
confidence, even though the unemployment rate has increased.  Although economic 
recovery has been progressing in Europe, financial stability concerns have 
resurfaced as the sovereign debt problem spread further. Major emerging market 
economies (EMEs) continue to experience robust growth.  
 Significantly, despite the slow recovery and slack capacity in advanced 
economies, international commodity prices such as oil, food, industrial inputs and 
metals have risen noticeably in recent weeks. Reflecting the strength of demand and 
higher commodity prices, inflation has started creeping up in most EMEs.

Domestic Economy 
Growth 
 GDP growth of 8.9 per cent in Q2 of 2010-11 suggests that domestic 
momentum remains strong. Agricultural growth has recovered on the back of a good 
monsoon. After flagging during August-September, the index of industrial production 
(IIP) grew by over 10 per cent in October 2010.  Various indicators of industrial 
activity, including the Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) also suggest a strong 
underlying momentum. Lead indicators of services sector activity have continued to 
increase at a robust pace. These developments reinforce the Reserve Bank’s 
projection of 8.5 per cent for real GDP growth for 2010-11 which will be reviewed in 
the Third Quarter Review scheduled on January 25, 2011.   
Inflation 
 After remaining in double digits for five successive months, year-on-year 
headline WPI inflation declined to 8.8 per cent in August 2010 and further to 7.5 per 
cent in November 2010. Consumer price (CPI) inflation for industrial workers and 
rural/agricultural labourers softened to single digit rates from August 2010, after 
remaining in double-digits for over a year. The overall reduction in inflation reflects 
moderation of food price inflation following a favourable monsoon. Food price 
inflation moderated from an average of 15.7 per cent in Q1 of 2010-11 to 12.3 per 
cent in Q2, to 10.0 per cent in October 2010 and further to 6.1 per cent in November 
2010. Amongst food items, the moderation in inflation for cereals and pulses has 
been larger than that in inflation of protein related food items such as egg, fish, meat 
and milk reflecting the structural nature of food inflation. In addition, inflation for non-
food primary articles such as raw cotton, raw rubber and minerals rose sharply. 
Reversing the declining trend in the last six months, non-food manufactured products 
inflation edged up to 5.4 per cent in November 2010. 
 Though inflation has moderated, inflationary pressures persist both from 
domestic demand and higher global commodity prices. The pace of decline in food 
price inflation has been slower than expected due largely to structural factors. There 
is a risk that rising international commodity prices will spill over into domestic 
inflation. Going forward, rising domestic input costs for the manufacturing sector 
combined with aggregate demand pressures could weigh on domestic inflation. The 
risk to the Reserve Bank’s projection of 5.5 per cent inflation by March 2011 is on the 
upside. 
Liquidity 
 While the overall liquidity in the system has remained in deficit consistent with 
the policy stance, the extent of tightness has been beyond the comfort level of the 
Reserve Bank.  This has been mainly due to persistence of large government cash 
balances which have averaged ` 84,000 crore since the Second Quarter Review of 
November, mirroring in the average net LAF repo amount of ` 1,01,000 crore. In 
addition, the liquidity deficit has been accentuated by structural factors such as 
significantly above-trend currency expansion and relatively sluggish growth in bank 
deposits even as the credit growth accelerated in 2010-11. While the liquidity deficit 
improved transmission of monetary policy signals with several banks raising deposit 
and lending interest rates, excessive deficits induce unpredictability in both 
availability and cost of funds, making it difficult for the banking system to sustain 
credit delivery. 
 In view of the persistent liquidity pressures in November 2010, the Reserve 
Bank implemented some measures such as additional liquidity support to SCBs 
under the LAF up to 2.0 per cent of their NDTL, continuation of second LAF, and 3 
 
OMO purchase of government securities. While these measures have helped 
stabilise overnight interest rates, the extent of deficit could constrain banks’ ability to 
expand their balance sheets commensurate with the productive needs of the 
economy.  The additional liquidity measures initiated by the Reserve Bank respond 
to these concerns. 
 As the economy expands, it needs primary liquidity, which will have to be 
provided in a manner consistent with the monetary policy stance. Such provision of 
liquidity should not be construed as a change in the monetary policy stance since 
inflation continues to remain a major concern. The measures taken in this review 
need to be appreciated in that context. 
Summing Up 
 To sum up, the underlying growth momentum of the Indian economy remains 
strong. Even as inflation has moderated, it remains significantly above the comfort 
level of the Reserve Bank. Moreover, risks to inflation remain on the upside, both 
from domestic demand and higher global commodity prices.  There is, therefore, a 
need for continued vigilance on the inflation front against the build-up of demand 
side pressures. A major challenge for the Reserve Bank in the recent period has 
been liquidity management. It is the Reserve Bank’s endeavour to alleviate the 
liquidity pressure in a manner consistent with the monetary policy stance of 
containing inflation and anchoring inflationary expectations. 
Expected Outcomes 
 The policy actions in this Review are expected to: 
• release  sizable primary liquidity into the system; 
• bring down the liquidity deficit in the system close to the comfort zone of 
the Reserve Bank; and 
• stabilise interest rates in the overnight inter-bank market closer to the 
operative policy rate of the Reserve Bank.
