RBI cancels the Licence of  
The Boriavi People's Co-operative Bank Ltd., Boriavi, (Gujarat) 
The Reserve Bank of India has cancelled the licence of the Boriavi People's 
Co-operative Bank Ltd., Boriavi, Gujarat. The order of cancellation of the licence was 
given after the close of business on November 19, 2010. The Reserve Bank has also

winding up the bank and appoint a liquidator.   
Consequent to the cancellation of its licence, The Boriavi People's Co-
operative Bank Ltd., Boriavi, Gujarat is prohibited from carrying on ëbanking

entitled to repayment of his/her deposits up to a monetary ceiling of ` 1,00,000/-

The Reserve Bank cancelled the licence of The Boriavi Peopleís Cooperative 
Bank Ltd. as the bank had ceased to be solvent, all efforts to revive it in close 
consultation with the Government of Gujarat had failed and the depositors were 
being inconvenienced by continued uncertainty. 
Background 
The Reserve Bank had given a licence to The Boriavi People's Co-operative 
Bank Ltd., Boriavi, Gujarat in December 1986.  The statutory inspection of the bank 
with reference to its financial position as on March 31, 2008 assessed the Capital to 
Risk Weighted Assets Ratio (CRAR) at (-) 17.9 per cent, negative networth at (-)       
` 67.40 lakh, erosion in deposits to the extent of 8.1 per cent. The bankís financial 
position deteriorated sharply as on March 31, 2009 wiping out its owned funds. Its 
deposits were also eroded to the extent of 22.2 per cent.  
Due to its precarious financial position, the bank was placed under directions 
under Section 35 A of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (As Applicable to 
Cooperative Societies) on September 17, 2009. The subsequent inspection of the 2 
 
bank with reference to its financial position as on March 31, 2010 revealed that the 
financial position of the bank was not sound. The bank also did not comply with the 
provisions of Section 11(1), 22(3) (a) and (b) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 
(As Applicable to Cooperative Societies).  
 
In the absence of any concrete/viable revival plan/ merger proposal for 
turnaround and means to achieve the required regulatory prescriptions, the 
possibility of revival of the bank was remote. Therefore, the Reserve Bank of India 
took the extreme measure of cancelling licence of the bank in the interest of bank's 
depositors.
