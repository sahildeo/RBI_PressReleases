Sources of Variation in Foreign Exchange Reserves  
in India during 2009-10 
 
Earlier today, the Reserve Bank of India released the Balance of Payments (BoP) data 
for the fourth quarter (January-March) of 2009-10 and for the full year (April-March) 2009-
10 on its website (www.rbi.org.in). On the basis of these data, sources of variation in foreign 
exchange reserves during 2009-10 have been compiled. 
 
Sources of Variation in Foreign Exchange Reserves: 2009-10 
During 2009-10, there was an accretion to the foreign exchange reserves.  Inflows 
under foreign investments and short term trade credits contributed significantly to the 
increase in foreign exchange reserves besides valuation gains. The sources of variation in the 
foreign exchange reserves are set out in Table 1.

Note: Increase in reserves (+)/Decrease in reserves (-). 
On a balance of payments basis (i.e., excluding valuation effects), the foreign 
exchange reserves increased by US$ 13.4 billion during 2009-10 as against a decline of US$ 20.1 billion during 2008-09. The valuation gains, reflecting the depreciation of the US dollar 
against major currencies, accounted for US$ 13.6 billion during 2009-10 as against a 
valuation loss of US$ 37.7 billion during 2008-09. Accordingly, valuation gains during 2009-
10 accounted for 50.4 per cent of the total increase in foreign exchange reserves.
