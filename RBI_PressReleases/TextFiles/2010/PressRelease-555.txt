RBI releases Handbook of Statistics on the Indian Economy 2009-10  
The Reserve Bank of India today released the twelfth volume of its annual statistical 
publication titled Handbook of Statistics on the Indian Economy (HBS) 2009-10. One of the 
major initiatives of the Reserve Bank, this publication is aimed at improving data 
dissemination to public. Through this publication, the Reserve Bank has been providing time 
series data on various economic and financial indicators for the Indian economy.  
The current volume contains 242 statistical tables covering national income 
aggregates, output, prices, money, banking, financial markets, public finances, foreign trade 
and balance of payments and select socio-economic indicators.  
To mark the Platinum Jubilee of the Reserve Bank, last year the Handbook was also 
released in electronic form on the "Data Base on Indian Economy (DBIE): Reserve Bank’s 
Data Warehouse" (URL http://dbie.rbi.org.in) facilitating near real time updation of 
information in the publication. The initiative was named as "Real Time HBS (RTHBS)". This 
publication is also released simultaneously in CD-ROM and is maintained on near real-time 
basis on the DBIE platform managed by the Department of Statistics and Information 
Management. Data tables from the DBIE platform and CD-ROM can be saved in the 
Microsoft excel format in order to facilitate their use for modelling and forecasting by various 
statistical and econometric packages.  
Comments and suggestions on the HBS are welcome and may please be forwarded 
to the Director, Operational Analysis Division, Department of Statistics and Information 
Management, Reserve Bank of India, C-9, 3rd floor, Bandra-Kurla Complex, Bandra (East),
