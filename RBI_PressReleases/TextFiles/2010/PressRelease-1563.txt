DRG Study on “Exchange Rate Policy and Modelling in India” 
 
The Reserve Bank of India released a DRG Study entitled, “Exchange Rate 
Policy and Modelling in India’. The Study is co-authored by Prof. Pami Dua, 
Professor in the Department of Economics of Delhi School of Economics along with 
Dr. Rajiv Ranjan, Director in the Department of Economic Analysis and Policy of the 
Reserve Bank of India. The study covers two main topics: first, various aspects of 
economic policy with respect to the exchange rate and second, modelling and 
forecasting the exchange rate.  
 
 The study analyses India’s exchange rate policy and discusses the structure 
of the foreign exchange market in India in terms of participants, instruments and 
trading platform, as also, turnover in the Indian foreign exchange market and forward 
premia. The study then attempts to develop a model for the rupee-dollar exchange 
rate taking into account variables from monetary and micro structure models as well 
as other variables including intervention by the central bank. The focus is on the 
exchange rate of the Indian rupee vis-à-vis the US dollar, i.e., the Re/$ rate.  
 
The study also covers the exchange rate policy of India in the background of 
large capital flows. The movement of the Indian rupee is largely influenced by the 
capital flow movements rather than traditional determinants like trade flows. Though 
capital flows are generally seen to be beneficial to an economy, a large surge in 
flows over a short span of time in excess of the domestic absorptive capacity can be 
a source of stress to the economy giving rise to upward pressures on the exchange 
rate, overheating of the economy, and possible asset price bubbles.  
 
The study notes that an important aspect of the policy response in India to the 
various episodes of volatility has been market intervention combined with monetary 
and administrative measures to meet the threats to financial stability while 
complementary or parallel recourse has been taken to communication through 
speeches and press releases. In line with the exchange rate policy, it has also been 
observed that the Indian rupee is moving along with the economic fundamentals in 
the post-reform period. Moving forward, as India progresses towards full capital 
account convertibility and gets more and more integrated with the rest of the world, 
managing periods of volatility is bound to pose greater challenges in view of the 
impossible trinity of independent monetary policy, open capital account and 
exchange rate management. Preserving stability in the market would require more 
flexibility, adaptability and innovations with regard to the strategy for liquidity 
management as well as exchange rate management. With the likely turnover in the 
foreign exchange market rising in future, further development of the foreign 
exchange market will be crucial to manage the associated risks.   2
After studying various aspects of economic policy with respect to the 
exchange rate, the study attempts to gauge the forecasting ability of economic 
models with respect to exchange rates with the difference that this is done in the 
context of a developing country that follows a managed floating (as opposed to 
flexible) exchange rate regime. Starting from the naïve model, the study examines 
the forecasting performance of the monetary model and various extensions of it in 
the vector autoregressive (VAR) and Bayesian vector autoregressive (BVAR) 
framework. The study examines, first, whether the monetary model can beat a 
random walk. Second, it investigates if the forecasting performance of the monetary 
model can be improved by extending it. Third, the study evaluates the forecasting 
performance of a VAR model vs a BVAR model. Lastly, it considers if information on 
intervention by the central bank can improve forecast accuracy. The main findings 
are : 
 
(i) The monetary model generally outperforms the naïve model. This negates the 
findings of the seminal study by Meese and Rogoff (1983) that finds that models 
which are based on economic fundamentals cannot outperform a naive 
random walk model.  
 
(ii) The result that it is possible to beat the naïve model may be due to the fact that 
the intervention by the central bank may help to curb volatility arising due to 
demand-supply mismatch and stabilise the exchange rate. The exchange rate 
policy of the Reserve Bank is guided by the need to reduce excess volatility.  
 
(iii) Forecast accuracy can be improved by extending the monetary model to 
include forward premium, volatility of capital inflows and order flow. 
 
(iv) Information on intervention by the central bank helps to improve forecasts at 
the longer end. 
 
(v) Bayesian vector autoregressive models generally outperform their 
corresponding VAR variants. 
 
 Thus, the availability of information on certain key variables at regular 
intervals that affect the exchange rate can lead to a more informed view about the 
behavior of the future exchange rates which may allow the market participants to 
plan their foreign exchange exposure better by hedging them appropriately. Such 
key variables could include past data on exchange rates, forward premia, capital 
flows, turnover and intervention by central banks. As regards availability of data on 
key variables relating to the Indian foreign exchange market, most of the data are 
available in public domain and can easily be accessed by market participants, 
academicians and professional researchers. Skilful use of these variables will help 
them gain sound insight into future exchange rate movements.
