RBI releases First Financial Stability Report : Says Limited Risk to Financial 
Stability, but Monitoring Required on an Ongoing Basis 
As announced in the Annual Policy Statement of April, 2009 the Reserve Bank of 
India established a Financial Stability Unit in August, 2009. The Second Quarter 
Review of Monetary Policy in October, 2009 made specific mention of a periodic 
Financial Stability Report (FSR) for India to enhance transparency and augment 
confidence in the financial system. The Financial Stability Report (FSR) published today 
is the first of these reports and is an attempt at institutionalising the implicit focus and 
making financial stability an integral driver of the policy framework. 
In general, the Financial Stability Reports will focus on reviewing the nature, 
magnitude and implications of risks that have bearing on the macroeconomic 
environment, financial institutions, markets and infrastructure. It will also assess the 
resilience of the financial sector through stress tests. It is hoped that FSRs will emerge 
as one of the key instruments for directing pre-emptive policy responses to incipient 
risks in the financial system. 
The FSR will be a key supplement to the evolving institutional arrangements in 
the coming months. The specific composition and the role of the proposed Financial 
Stability and Development Council (FSDC) is yet to crystallise. But the role of the 
Reserve Bank in any future arrangement, as regards financial stability, will continue to 
be critical.  
This inaugural report details the prevailing financial system in India and also 
gives some background on past financial stability initiatives.  
Global Outlook  
The forceful and coordinated global policy response to the crisis has facilitated 
the relative stabilisation of global markets and easing of credit risk concerns after the 
financial turmoil, especially in the second half of 2009. Uncertainties about growth 
prospects and financial stability, however, persist. The unevenness of the global 
recovery adds to this uncertainty. Further, concerns about sovereign credit risk have 
also intensified in the light of the fiscal woes of Greece and some other Euro zone 
nations.  
While global imbalances declined somewhat due to contraction of demand in 
advanced economies during the financial crisis, the structural problem associated with 
the imbalances remains. There are some incipient signs of the recurrence of these 
imbalances with the economic recovery, which is reminiscent of the pre-crisis days and 
could emerge as a cause for concern. Though the exposure of the Indian financial 
system to the international markets remains relatively low, the contagion impact from 
the global macroeconomic shocks on the Indian financial sector cannot be ruled out.  
Outlook for India 
There are evident signs of recovery in the growth increasingly taking hold. 
Hence, the process of monetary policy exit has already begun. Early steps to exit from  2
the fiscal stimulus measures have also been initiated with the Union Budget for 2010-11 
committing a return to the process of fiscal consolidation. The process of fiscal 
consolidation should facilitate better monetary management. In recognition of the 
Governmentís intent to bring down deficit and debt levels, along with the positive 
outlook on domestic economic growth, S&P has recently upgraded its outlook on India 
from ìNegativeî to ìStableî. 
Going forward, however, there are several factors which may have a bearing on 
financial stability considerations, including inflationary pressures and expectations, 
management of government borrowing program, and capital flows. 
Key Findings of Report 
Banking Sector 
ï The banking sector remains broadly healthy. Banks remain well capitalized in 
terms of regulatory capital adequacy ratios, with higher core capital and 
sustainable financial leverage, and this contributes to financial stability 
ï Stress tests for credit and market risk reveal banksí ability to withstand 
unexpected levels of stress.  
ï Credit quality continues to remain robust. The share of low cost current and 
savings account deposits in total deposits is high. Banks are required to hold a 
minimum percentage of their liabilities in risk free government securities. This, to 
a large extent, takes care of liquidity and solvency issues.  
ï Stress tests indicate that the banking sector is comfortably resilient and, even if, 
in a worst case scenario, it is assumed that all restructured standard advances 
were to become NPAs, the stress would not be significant. 
ï While the resilience of the commercial banks to credit and interest rate shocks 
has improved over time, the liquidity scenario analysis shows some potential 
risk. 
ï The margins of banks may face pressure from the MTM impact on the 
investment portfolio, increased provisioning requirement and calculation of 
interest on savings bank deposits on a daily basis from April 1, 2010.   
ï The Asset Liability Management (ALM) analysis does not indicate any significant 
mismatches at the current juncture. The credit growth in recent times, however, 
has been mostly marked in sectors like infrastructure and commercial real 
estate, both of which require longer term funding. The resultant ALM mismatches 
would require careful monitoring on an ongoing basis. 
ï Over-reliance on bulk deposits in certain institutions, which remain at elevated 
levels, could impact the cost and stability of the deposit base. With a fast 
expanding corporate sector and extant exposure norms, the headroom available 
to banks is constrained and needs to be addressed. 
Household and Corporate Sectors  
ï The balance sheets of households and corporates suggest that the financial 
system is not exposed to the risk of large leverages in these sectors.  
ï The propensity to take unhedged corporate foreign exchange exposures 
constitutes a potential source of risk to the banking sector. 
Management of Capital Account 
ï Uncertainty with regard to capital flows could pose a challenge for management 
of the capital account. At the current juncture, though, there is little evidence that 
the quantum of inflows has exceeded the absorptive capacity of the economy.  3
While there is a menu of policy options to respond to the challenge, the optimal 
policy mix will have to be carefully calibrated taking into account the evolving 
state of the economy and financial stability considerations. 
Non-Banking Financial Sector  
ï The sector was able to manage the fallout of the crisis without creating systemic 
issues.  However, ALM mismatches, credit quality and the interconnected flows 
between NBFCs and other financial sector entities would need to be closely 
monitored. 
ï Given the increasing significance of the non-banking financial sector, the 
supervisory regime for the systemically important non-deposit taking NBFCs will 
need to be strengthened for a more robust assessment of the underlying risks.  
Financial Conglomerates  
ï A monitoring and oversight framework for systemically important financial 
institutions (called financial conglomerates (FC) in India) is already in place, 
which needs to be strengthened. The Reserve Bank, in consultation with other 
sectoral regulators, is in the process of implementing an enhanced framework for 
regulation and supervision of financial conglomerates 
Financial Markets & Infrastructure 
ï The real challenge in developing financial markets and products in the future 
would be the de-concentration of risks from the banking system. In the Indian 
context, the key underpinnings while developing the markets would be to ensure 
that: (i) the process of disintermediation away from banks is genuine, and (ii), 
wherever banks and non-bank finance companies are involved, there is clear, 
transparent capture of the risks within a prudential framework.  
ï Central counterparties have emerged as critical elements for the smooth 
functioning of the financial markets and as a means to reduce systemic risk 
posed by derivative markets. These entities are increasingly becoming 
systemically important market institutions and need to be regulated more firmly 
for robust risk management systems. Their capital, margining and collateral 
requirements need to be assessed from a prudential and systemic stability 
perspective.  
ï The delay in disposal of legal suits is a major concern in the Indian context, 
particularly in the case of insolvency proceedings. Legislative initiatives are 
required in this regard. 
Data Issues 
ï India has made significant strides in enhancing its data dissemination standards. 
Data gaps need to be overcome in the area of interconnectedness of financial 
institutions, household indebtedness and a system level database on asset 
prices in certain segments like the commercial real estate exposure.
