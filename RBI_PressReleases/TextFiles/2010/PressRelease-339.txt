RBI extends Liquidity Easing Measures 
 
With a view to alleviating frictional liquidity pressure, the Reserve Bank of India 
had announced two liquidity easing measures on October 29, 2010.  
As the frictional liquidity pressure may persist and in order to provide liquidity 
comfort, it has been decided to extend the liquidity easing measures announced on 
October 29, 2010 on all days during November 1 - 4, 2010. Accordingly,   
ï  Scheduled commercial banks may avail of additional liquidity support under the 
liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) to the extent of up to 1.0 per cent of their net 
demand and time liabilities (NDTL) as on October 8, 2010. As the LAF auction on 
November 4, 2010 will be for four days, banks may seek waiver of penal interest 
for any shortfall in maintenance of statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) arising out of 
availment of this facility up to November 7, 2010 purely as an ad hoc, temporary 
measure. 
ï A special second LAF (SLAF) will be conducted  at 4.15 p.m. on all days during 
November 1- 4, 2010.
