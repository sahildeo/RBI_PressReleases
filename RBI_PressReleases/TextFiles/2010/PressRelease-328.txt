RBI Announces OMO Purchase of Government Securities 
 
The liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) window of the Reserve Bank has 
remained in an injection mode since September 9, 2010. The average daily net 
injection of liquidity through LAF was ` 61,700 crore in October 2010 with a peak 
injection of ` 1,28,685 crore on October 30, 2010. With a view to alleviating frictional 
liquidity pressure, the Reserve Bank on October 29, 2010 announced two liquidity 
easing measures viz., conducting second LAF (SLAF) and allowing scheduled 
commercial banks to avail of additional liquidity support under the LAF to the extent 
of up to 1.0 per cent of their NDTL as on October 8, 2010.  These measures have 
been  extended up to November 4, 2010. 
 
The Reserve Bank in its Second Quarter Review of Monetary Policy released 
today has stated that even though a liquidity deficit is consistent with an anti-inflation 
stance, excessive deficit can be disruptive to both financial markets and to credit 
growth in the banking system. To ensure that economic activity is not disrupted by 
liquidity constraints, the liquidity deficit needs to be contained within a reasonable 
limit.  
 
Consistent with the stance of monetary policy and based on the current 
assessment of prevailing and evolving liquidity conditions, the Reserve Bank has 
decided to conduct purchase of the following government securities under its open 
market operations (OMO) for an aggregate amount of Rs 12,000 crore through multi-
security auction using the multiple price method: 
 
Sr. No Security Maturity Date 
1. 7.38% GS 2015 03-Sep-2015 
2. 7.02% GS 2016 17-Aug-2016 
3. 7.80% GS 2020 03-May-2020 
 
The auction shall be conducted by the Reserve Bank of India, Mumbai Office, 
Fort, Mumbai on November  4, 2010.
