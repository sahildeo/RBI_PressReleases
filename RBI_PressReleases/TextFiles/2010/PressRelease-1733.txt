Half-yearly Report on Foreign Exchange Reserves - April-September 2009 
The Reserve Bank of India has released the 13th half-yearly report on 
management of foreign exchange reserves for the period April-September 2009. 
It may be recalled that in February 2004, the Reserve Bank had commenced 
a process of compiling half yearly reports and placing them in the public domain with 
a lag of about three months for bringing about more transparency and also for 
enhancing the level of disclosure. The first such report for the half year ended 
September 30, 2003 was released on February 3, 2004.
