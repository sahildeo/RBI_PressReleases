 The year 2009-10 marks the Platinum Jubilee year of the Reserve Bank of 
India. To mark the occasion, the Honíble Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh today 
released a book titled Perspectives on Central Banking: Governors Speak brought out 
by the Reserve Bank. The book is a collection of select speeches of Governors. The 
Reserve Bank has seen twenty two Governors so far including the current serving 
Governor, Dr. Duvvuri Subbarao. The compendium of speeches contains 32 speeches 
by 18 Governors. 
 
The selection of speeches in this compendium provides glimpses into the ideas, 
issues and concerns that have engaged the Reserve Bank over the years. It covers 
thoughts on the core of central banking, ranging from the conduct of monetary policy 
and external sector issues to financial inclusion and Reserve Bankís concern for the 
common man. 
 
The Honíble Prime Minister, a former Governor of the Reserve Bank himself, also 
felicitated past Governors Dr. C. Rangarajan, Dr. Bimal Jalan, Dr. Y. Venugopal Reddy 
and the current serving Governor Dr. Duvvuri Subbarao at this event. Honíble Finance 
Minister, the Finance Secretary and the Deputy Governors of the Bank were present on 
the occasion. 
 
 Honíble Prime Minister in his address noted that, ì. . . the Reserve Bank has a 
great tradition. The Reserve Bank was instrumental in institutional building in the areas 
of rural, industrial and housing finance. It has played a remarkable role in the economic 
development of the country as evident from reasonable growth with price stability and 
financial inclusion.î 
 
Looking ahead, Dr. Duvvuri Subbarao, Governor, observed, ì. . . for a public 
policy institution like the Reserve Bank, there is no final destination: the goal posts just 
keep moving with new challenges and tasks replacing the current ones . . .. This 
compendium of speeches is also a reminder to us in the Reserve Bank of the need to 
be constantly pushing the envelope to remain useful and relevant.î
