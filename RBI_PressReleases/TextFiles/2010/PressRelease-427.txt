This article provides details on developments in India's balance of payments 
during April-June 2010 (Q1).  
Main Findings 
The higher trade deficit combined with the lower invisibles surplus widened 
the current account deficit during Q1. The capital account surplus increased 
significantly, over the corresponding quarter of last year, on account of short-term 
trade credit, external commercial borrowings, external assistance and banking 
capital. With capital account surplus being higher than the current account deficit, the 
overall balance was in surplus at US$ 3.7 billion.

External Debt Outstanding, External Debt by Component, Currency Composition, 
Instrument-wise classification, Short-Term Debt by Original Maturity and Residual 
Maturity and cross country comparisons of external debt of select developing 
countries etc. 
Main Findings 
The long-term debt at US$ 215.2 billion and short-term debt at US$ 57.8 
billion accounted for 78.8 per cent and 21.2 per cent, respectively, of the total 
external debt. The article highlights India’s external debt as of end-June 2010,  2

3. Inflation Expectations Survey Of Households; June 2010 (Round 20) 
The Bank has been conducting inflation expectations survey of households 
(IESH) on a quarterly basis since 2005. The present article is based on the survey 
round 20 (quarter ended June 2010).  Presently the survey is limited to households 
from four major metropolitan cities and eight other major cities. The major 
metropolitan cities, are represented by 500 households each while the eight other 
cities are represented by 250 households each.  
Main Findings 
This article presents the survey findings.. It gives respondents’ perceptions of 
current inflation as well inflation expectations for 3 months ahead (July-September 
2010) and one year ahead (July 10-June 11).The survey findings indicate that 
households expect inflation to rise further by 30 and 80 basis points during next 
quarter (11.4 per cent) and next year (11.9 per cent) respectively from the expected 
current rate of 11.10 per cent.  
Household's expectations of general price rise is mainly influenced by 
movements in food grains prices. High price-rise is expected in food, housing prices 
and cost of service. On category–wise inflation expectations, housewives and daily-
wage workers are comparatively more consistent in the inflation expectations. 
4. New Series of Wholesale Price Index Numbers (Base 2004-05=100) 
The series on Index Numbers of Wholesale Prices with base 1993-94=100 
had been in use since April 2000.A Working Group was established for the revision 
of the WPI series (base 1993-94=100) on December 26, 2003 under the 
Chairmanship of Prof. Abhijit Sen, Member, Planning Commission. Based on the 
recommendations of the Working Group, the Ministry came out with the new series 
of Wholesale Price Index with the base year 2004-05=100 from August 2010, on 
September 14, 2010.   
Main Findings 
At the aggregate level, the price trend as well as inflation of new series (base 
2004-05=100) is similar to those of the old series (base 1993-94). However, there 
are a number of significant changes in the new series in terms of weighting diagram, 
coverage, and price collection mechanism. There is a reduction in the weight of 
‘Primary Articles’ by 1.9 percentage points. On the other hand, weights of ‘Fuel and 
Power’ and ‘Manufactured Products’ have gone up by 0.7 percentage points and 1.2 
percentage points, respectively. In terms of coverage, the number of commodities in 
the new series has gone up significantly to 676, as compared to 435 commodities of 
the earlier series. Further, in order to ensure a better representation of price, the 
number of price quotations has also increased significantly to 5482 from 1918 price 
quotations of the old series. The latest WPI revision to the base year 2004-05=100 is 
a welcome development and will be better representative of overall inflation of the 
economy.
