Managing Inflation in the Post-Crisis Environment 
Inflation has been the key driver of monetary policy actions in recent past 
Dr. Gokarn’s article analyses the key drivers of inflation in Indian economy in 
the recent past and presents the key concerns that have influenced the sequence 
and magnitude of monetary actions.  
Main Messages 
The article argues that the management of current inflation requires both 
supply-side and demand-side approaches. Monetary policy has addressed the latter 
with a gradual, calibrated set of actions on both, interest rates and liquidity 
management. The pace and sequencing of the actions have been influenced by 
both, persistent global uncertainties and the need to support domestic recovery. This 
has required a balancing act between reining in inflationary expectations and 
adequate liquidity in the domestic financial system. 
Quarterly Industrial Outlook Survey: April-June 2010 (50th Round) 
Manufacturing Sector shows moderation but Employment Scenario shows 
Improvement and Some Industry Groups intend Higher Investments  
This article presents the survey findings of industrial outlook survey conducted 
by the Reserve Bank of India for April-June 2010 quarter. This is the 50th round in 
the series. It gives the assessment of business situation of companies in 
manufacturing sector, for the quarter April-June 2010 and their expectations for the 
ensuing quarter July- September 2010. The Reserve Bank of India has been 
conducting the quarterly industrial outlook surveys since 1998 with a view of gaining 
insight into the performance and prospects of the corporate sector engaged in 
?????????? 2
manufacturing activities. The survey results are an important input in monetary policy 
making.   
Main Findings 
• The survey depicts that while remaining in the growth terrain, the 
manufacturing sector showed moderation both, for the current quarter (April-
June 2010) as well as in the subsequent quarter (July-September 2010).  
 
• Demand conditions were somewhat subdued and backlog in pending orders 
had been substantially cleared.  
 
• Capacity utilisation did not show any improvement and therefore the 
manufacturers did not envisage any need for installing additional capacity.  
 
• The pressure on profit margins is expected to increase in the coming months 
even though selling prices are expected to increase.  
 
• The survey indicates a likely improvement in the employment scenario. As in 
the last few rounds of the survey, firms in fertilisers, transport equipment, 
pharmaceuticals and medicines, basic chemicals and electrical machinery are 
more sanguine about their business situation.  
 
• Industry groups, such as, basic metals and metal products, other machinery 
and apparatus, textiles and basic chemicals have expressed higher 
investment intentions for FY 2010-11.  
Performance of Private Corporate Business Sector, 2009-10 
Size matters in growth and profitability 
 The article analyses the performance of the private corporate business sector 
during 2009-10 based on abridged results relating to 2,629 non-government non-
financial listed public limited companies and provides, among other things, a brief 
analysis by size and industry.  
Main Findings 
• The non-government non-financial companies that broadly represent the 
private corporate sector, witnessed a deceleration in aggregate sales growth 
in 2009-10 to about 12 per cent from the previous year's relatively higher 
sales growth of about 17 per cent.  
 
• Net profits, however, recorded a noticeable rise of more than 28 per cent vis-
à-vis a fall of 18.2 per cent in 2008-09. The improved profit growth was partly 
on account of the lower base of 2008-09. Apart from the base effect, improved 
net profits were also a result of lower rise in expenditure in relation to sales, 
decline in interest outgo and support from other income despite higher 
provisioning towards depreciation and tax. The margins showed improvement 
at operating, gross and net profit levels.  
 
• Analysis of companies with sales as size variable revealed that companies 
with sales of more than `1,000 crore dominated the overall corporate 
performance. This group reported the highest rise in sales. It was also 
observed that size influenced growth and profitability – larger the size, higher 
was the sales growth and also the gross profit margin.  
 
• In terms of sectoral breakdown, companies in manufacturing and IT sector 
recorded robust profit growth in the operating level itself. However, companies 
in services sector other than IT companies witnessed a subdued profit 
performance in 2009-10.   3
• A high provision towards depreciation maintained by companies in 
manufacturing and services sector indicated commissioning of investments in 
fixed assets.  
 
• Industry-wise analysis revealed that sales rose for 26 out of 28 industry 
groups captured in the study, the exception being hotel and restaurants 
industry and chemical fertilisers and pesticides industry.  
 
• In terms of profitability, net profit margin improved for 19 industry groups.  
 
Performance of Financial and Investment Companies, 2008-09 
External Source remained Major Source of Finance 
The study on Performance of Financial and Investment Companies, 2008-
09 analyses the performance of non-Government financial and investment 
companies (other than banking, insurance and chit-fund companies) during the year 
2008-09. The study is based on audited annual accounts of 1,215 companies during 
the period April 2008 to March 2009. The select 1,215 companies accounted for 49.5 
per cent of total paid-up capital (provisional estimate supplied by Ministry of 
Corporate Affairs, Government of India) of all non-government financial and 
investment companies as on March 31, 2009 compared with 38.1 per cent in the 
previous study. 
Main Findings 
• The main income of select companies increased at a lower rate by 15.7 per 
cent in 2008-09, as against an increase of 40.6 per cent registered in the 
previous year. Though, total expenditure grew at a lower rate of 33.4 per cent 
in 2008-09 compared with 62.6 per cent in 2007-08, it was higher than the 
income growth. As a result, profits after tax declined by 7.9 per cent in 2008-
09 as against 18.4 per cent growth registered in 2007-08 along with 
diminishing profitability to 35.0 per cent in 2008-09 from 43.4 per cent in 2007-
08. 
 
• Business of the select companies expanded at a slower pace. They raised 
funds amounting to Rs.44,947 crore during 2008-09 as against Rs.86,348 
crore raised during 2007-08. Though the share of external sources in total 
sources declined to 67.3 per cent during 2008-09 from 86.0 per cent during 
the previous year, it continued to be the major sources of finance. 
Monthly Seasonal Factors for Selected Economic and Financial Time Series of 
the Indian economy 
Seasonal variation in CPI for Industrial Workers higher than in overall WPI 
The study on Monthly Seasonal Factors for Selected Economic and 
Financial Time Series of the Indian economy is being regularly published in the 
Reserve Bank of India Bulletin since 1980. This article analyses the seasonal 
behaviour of 77 major macroeconomic series based on monthly data over the period 
from April 1994 to March 2010.  
Main Findings 
• The study observes that over the years, the intra-year seasonal variations of 
aggregate deposits and non-food credit of scheduled commercial banks 
exhibited almost similar movements.  
 
• Within the WPI-All Commodities group, WPI-Primary Articles indicated higher 
seasonal fluctuations as compared to WPI-Manufactured Products group.   4
• Among the Food Articles group, the prices of ‘Fruits and Vegetables’ group 
exhibited high seasonal variation, during the reference period (April 1994 to 
March 2010).  
 
• The seasonal variations of CPI-Industrial Workers are higher than those of 
WPI-All Commodities.  
 
• A comparison of seasonal factors of IIP, according to the use-based 
classification, revealed that the seasonal variation was the highest in respect 
of capital goods.  
 
• Among the selected transport services indicators, the range of seasonal 
variations of ‘Revenue on Railway Freight Traffic’ was higher as compared to 
that of ‘Cargo Handled at Major Ports’.  
 
• Over the reference period, exports exhibited higher seasonal variations than 
non-oil import.  
 
• The intra-year seasonal variation in Broad Money (M) and WPI-All 
3
Commodities had narrowed down from 2003-04 onwards.  
 
• The ranges of seasonal factors of bank credit (scheduled commercial banks) 
and Index of Industrial Production (IIP) exhibited similar movements over the 
reference period. 
India’s Foreign Trade: 2010-11 (April-June)   
Merchandise Trade recovers but Trade with Major Partners decline 
The article on India’s Foreign Trade: 2010-11 (April-June)  reviews the 
performance of India’s merchandise trade during 2010-11 (April-June) on the basis 
of the data released by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry and Directorate 
General of Commercial Intelligence and Statistics (DGCI&S). The article also covers 
disaggregated commodity-wise and direction-wise analysis of India’s trade during the 
period 2009-10 (April-January). 
Main Findings 
• The article observes that during April-May (2010-11), India’s merchandise 
exports at US$ 33.0 billion posted a growth of 33.2 per cent over the 
corresponding period of previous year as against a decline of 33.3 per cent 
during April-May (2009-10). 
• Merchandise imports at US$ 54.7 billion recorded a growth of 39.5 per cent as 
against a decline of 34.3 per cent during April-May (2009-10). The oil and 
non-oil imports registered a growth of 68.5 per cent and 29.6 per cent in April-
May (2010-11), respectively, as against a decline of 48.3 per cent and 27.6 
per cent in April-May (2009-10).  
• The disaggregated data on commodity-wise merchandise trade as well as 
source and direction of exports and imports reveal that trade of all major 
commodity groups (namely, primary products, manufactured goods, 
petroleum products and bulk and non bulk import items) and with major 
trading partners (namely, OECD, OPEC, Eastern Europe and Developing 
Countries) registered a decline during April-December 2009 over the 
corresponding period of previous year.
