RBI Staff Studies : "Trends in Select Micro and Small Scale 
Production Items during Phases of Industrial Slowdown" 
 The economic strain encountered by the Indian industrial sector during downturns 
in business cycles is captured by the monthly index of industrial production. However, 
the index fails to document the degree and extent of the hardships faced by certain 
sections of the industry, particularly the unorganized small scale sector during periods of 
stress due to inadequate representation in the index. The lack of high frequency data 
hamper the macroeconomic analysis and flow of useful information for an employment 
intensive sector like small scale industry which is characterized by several forward and 
backward linkages. It is a well known fact that the small scale sector suffers from 
constraints some of which are limited access to finance, discontinuous cash flows and 
constrained capacity to absorb adverse demand shocks which further aggravates during 
industrial slowdown phases. The sector accounts for bulk of the unskilled employment 
and is a conduit for transmitting shocks to the real sector. The identification of pockets of 
stress within the sector may facilitate the Central Bank to address the sector's credit 
needs at appropriate prices.  
 This paper attempts to circumvent the data handicaps and gauge the impact of 
the slowdown in 2007-09 on small scale industry and its employment. The monthly 
trends in ten small scale items included in the index of industrial production for which 
data is more consistently available for the period April 2000 to February 2009 is 
segregated and analysed. A comparative performance measure index for micro and 
small scale (MSEs) items and non- small scale (Non-MSEs) items is constructed to 
evaluate the performance of the industry groups during the period 2001-09, with a 
particular focus on the slowdown period of 2007-09. Econometric analysis is then 
performed to explain the causal factors behind variations in the MSE production index.  
The paper finds evidence that the cyclical slowdown in the industry that set in during 
2007-08Q1, retarded the pace of growth in MSEs as well as Non-MSEs. However, MSEs 
have recorded relatively better performance than Non-MSEs during the slowdown period 
at least in the ten items under review. Econometric analysis shows that both domestic 
and external demand bears a statistically significant influence on MSE output. However, 
the impact of domestic demand is comparatively stronger. Interestingly, credit to MSEs 
has been found to be very significant, although the sign of the coefficient (negative in this 
case) is contrary to theoretical expectations.  
 The moderation of growth in MSEs is presaged to have a dampening impact on 
employment in the sector, particularly in ëfood productsí and ëwood and wood productsí 
which have recorded substantial decline in output and employ bulk of the unskilled labour 
with no social security.  
 The paper concludes that policies on MSEs credit and technology needs to be 
customised by the nature of the MSE business cycle, nature of its product and markets it 
caters to. Given the dependence of large number of employees on the sector, adequate 
attention needs to be channeled into social security cover for employees with, of course, 
an eye on the associated costs of providing such cover.
