Do Not fall Prey to Fictitious Offers of Funds Transfer: RBI Advisory 
 
The Reserve Bank advised banks on May 26, 2010, to exercise due caution and to 
be extra vigilant concerning the fictitious offers whereby bank accounts are opened and/or 
transactions made in the accounts for receiving payments styled as transaction charges, 
etc, towards the so-called transfer of prize money/award money, etc. The Reserve Bank 
has clarified that any person resident in India collecting and effecting/remitting such 
payments directly /indirectly outside India is liable to be proceeded against with, for 
contravention of the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 besides being liable for 
violation of regulations relating to Know Your Customer (KYC) norms/Anti Money 
Laundering (AML) standards. 
 
The Reserve Bank has also re-iterated that the Foreign Exchange Management 
Act, 1999 prohibits remittance in any form towards participation in lottery schemes. These 
restrictions are also applicable to remittances for participation in lottery like schemes 
existing under different names, such as, money circulation scheme or remittances for the 
purpose of securing prize money/awards, etc. 
 
In its circular issued to banks, the Reserve Bank has stated that there has been a 
spate of fictitious offers of cheap funds in recent times from fraudsters. These came 
through letters, e-mails, mobile phones, SMS, etc. Detailing the modalities of the 
fraudsters, the Reserve Bank stated that communication was being sent on fake 
letterheads of the Reserve Bank and purportedly signed by its top executives/senior 
officials to targetted people. Many residents have been victims of such teasing offers and 
have lost huge sums of money in the process. It was further brought to the Reserve 
Bankís notice that fraudsters sought money from gullible people, under different heads, 
such as, processing fees/ transaction fees/ tax clearance charges/ conversion charges, 
clearing fees, etc. The fraudsters open multiple accounts in banks in the name of 
individuals or proprietary concerns in different bank branches for collecting transaction 
charges, etc. The fraudsters persuade the victims to deposit certain amount in these 
accounts. The amounts are withdrawn immediately leaving the victims in a quandary. 
  
The Reserve Bank has alerted the public on several occasions in the past about 
such fictitious schemes/offers through the print and the electronic media. More such 
public education campaigns are also being planned. The Reserve Bank has asked banks 
to bring the contents of the circular to the notice of their constituents and customers 
concerned and to give it wide publicity.
