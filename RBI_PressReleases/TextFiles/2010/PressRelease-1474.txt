FM inaugurates RBI-OECD International Workshop on Financial Literacy 
 
To mark the Platinum Jubilee Year, the Reserve Bank of India, in coordination 
with the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) 
organised an International Workshop on “Delivering Financial Literacy” at Bengaluru 
on March 22, 2010. The two day international workshop was organised to advance 
and elevate policy dialogue on financial education and literacy in the international 
arena and particularly in India and countries from the ASEAN( Association of 
Southeast Asian Nations), SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional 
Cooperation). 
 
Dr. D. Subbarao, Governor, Reserve Bank of India, in his opening remarks, 
emphasized that “financial literacy and awareness are integral to ensuring financial 
inclusion”. It is not just about imparting financial knowledge and information, he said, 
it is also about changing behaviour. Stressing upon the ultimate goal  to empower 
people to take actions that are in their own self-interest, he said that financial 
education would help the consumers know enough to demand accountability and 
seek redressal of grievances. This in turn, would enhance the integrity and quality of 
financial markets.  Recalling the one big lesson learnt from the extensive outreach 
programmes, involving the Top Management of the Reserve Bank, he viewed that 
financial literacy is not just a public good, but also a merit good. Treating financial 
inclusion and financial literacy as twin pillars, the Governor emphasized that financial 
literacy and education should be developed hand in hand with improving access to 
financial services. 
Inaugurating the two day Workshop, Hon’ble Union Finance Minister,         
Shri Pranab Mukherjee, in the keynote address said that financial education and 
literacy could ideally supplement the broader initiatives for efficient and inclusive 
transmission mechanisms and the case for exploring the potential for integrating 
financial education and literacy into the overall endeavour for financial inclusion in a 
diversified country like India. He further viewed that while India has no nationwide 
structured financial education programme either at school level or, in general, but 
institution-specific initiatives by Reserve Bank of India, various Self Regulatory 
Organizations, Indian Banks Association, commercial banks, Banking Code and 
Standards Board of India, and more recently, by the Securities & Exchange Board of 
India would seek to fill the gaps in financial literacy and education. The Finance 
Minister lauded the Reserve Bank’s initiative of ‘Project Financial Literacy’, which 
disseminates information in 13 languages through its website on the central bank 
and general banking concepts to various target groups. He said that from a policy  2
perspective, financial education empowers the common person and thus reduces the 
burden of protecting the common person from the elements of market failure, 
attributable to information asymmetries. Acknowledging the wide divergence in 
literacy levels across various states, the multilingual framework, the marked 
differences between rural and urban areas within a State and a perceptible variation 
in the penetration of banking across regions, he emphasized that public policy 
institutions, including Government and the Reserve Bank have to play a crucial and 
challenging role in designing appropriate delivery mechanisms for financial literacy 
and education duly nuancing the regional differences. Today, new financial sector 
initiatives in India need to explicitly prioritise both financial inclusion and financial 
education and literacy, the Finance Minister said. 
 
Speaking on the occasion, Ambassador Richard A. Boucher, Deputy 
Secretary General, OECD said that financial education is a major tool for 
empowering the poorest people to look after their families and develop the nation. 
The OECD is keen to promote financial education worldwide through its international 
network on financial education and close partnership with key countries like India. 
Congratulating India and the Reserve Bank, he said that their unique efforts would 
definitely improve financial inclusion. 
 
Hon’ble Finance Minister also released a RBI book on “Financial Planning by 
First-time Earners” authored by Mrs Swapna Mirashi on the occasion.
