Conference on "Investment and its Financing:  
What causes private investment to remain relatively low in Asia?" 
 
The Reserve Bank of India and the European Commission are organising the 
conference "Investment and its Financing: What causes private investment to remain 
relatively low in Asia?". The conference will be taking place at Trident Hotel Nariman 
Point, Mumbai, India, on December 16-17, 2010.  
 
             This conference will provide participants with an opportunity to share 
analysis on the key economic issues for Asia and EU in the aftermath of the worst 
global financial and economic crisis since the Great Depression. As the conference 
is under the umbrella of ASEM (the Asia-Europe meeting), it will bring together 
representatives from each of the 48 ASEM member countries together with 
representatives of central banks, multilateral organisations, private sector, think-
tanks and academia.  
 
The conference participants will examine what drives investment in Asia and 
Europe, the impediments to its financing, and will exchange views about policy 
challenges that lie ahead. The various sessions in the one and a half day conference 
will address issues such as the role of investment for productivity and growth, credit 
growth and financial stability, ways to channel savings into investment, the role of the 
financial sector and the impact of infrastructure bottlenecks on growth.  
 
The conference will provide a useful forum to exchange views and research 
findings on issues relevant from a policy making perspective. It will serve as input to 
the ASEM economic process and to the broader analysis of the rebalancing of global 
growth, already a central theme of the G20 forum.
