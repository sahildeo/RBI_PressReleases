Reserve Bank Cancels the Licence of the Raichur Zilla Mahila Pattana Sahakara 
Bank Niyamitha, Raichur, Karnataka 
 
In view of the fact that the Raichur Zilla Mahila Pattana Sahakara Bank 
Niyamitha, Raichur (Karnataka) had ceased to be solvent, all efforts to revive it in close 
consultation with the Government of Karnataka had failed and the depositors of the 
bank were being inconvenienced by continued uncertainty, the Reserve Bank of India 
delivered the order canceling its licence to the bank after the close of business on 
January 29, 2010. The Registrar of Co-operative Societies, Karnataka has also been 
requested to issue an order for winding up of the bank and appoint a Liquidator for the 
bank. It may be highlighted that on liquidation every depositor is entitled to repayment 
of his deposits up to a monetary ceiling of Rs.1,00,000/- from the Deposit Insurance 
and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC). 
   
The bank was granted  licence by Reserve Bank of India on March 16, 1995 to 
commence banking business. The statutory inspection conducted by Reserve Bank 
with reference to its financial position as on March 31, 2005 revealed several 
disquieting features in the functioning of the bank. Accordingly certain restrictions were 
imposed on the bank prohibiting it among others, from sanctioning fresh loans and 
advances till it complied with CRR/SLR requirements. The next inspection conducted 
with respect to position as on March 31, 2006 revealed that the bank's financial position 
had deteriorated sharply during the year. It also revealed irregularities in the functioning 
of the Board. The Board was superseded and an administrator appointed by the 
Registrar of Co-operative Societies, Karnataka vide order dated April 11, 2007.  
 
The subsequent inspection conducted with reference to position as on March 31, 
2007 also revealed further deterioration of the financials and the restrictions imposed 
were continued. The latest inspection with respect to position as on March 31, 2009 
had revealed that the financial position of the bank had turned precarious. In view of the 
severe liquidity problem and the deficiencies observed in the functioning of the bank as 
detailed above, in public interest and in the interest of the depositors to prevent 
preferential payment and to preserve the assets of the bank, the bank was placed 
under directions under Section 35A of the Act vide directive dated September 04, 2009 
prohibiting it from sanctioning/renewing of loans and advances, making investments, 
borrowings and acceptance of fresh deposits.  A cap of Rs.1000/- per depositor was 
placed on withdrawal of deposits. Subsequently, a show cause notice (SCN) for 
cancellation of licence was issued on September 17, 2009.  The reply to the SCN did 
not furnish any viable plan for revival of the bank. 
  2
After taking into account the foregoing and after examining all options for its 
revival, the Reserve Bank of India took the extreme measure of canceling the licence of 
the bank in the interest of the bank's depositors.  With the cancellation of its licence and 
commencement of liquidation proceedings, the process of paying the depositors of the 
Raichur Zilla Mahila Pattana Sahakara Bank Niyamitha, Raichur (Karnataka) the 
amount insured as per the DICGC Act will be set in motion. 
 
Consequent on cancellation of its licence, Raichur Zilla Mahila Pattana Sahakara 
Bank Niyamitha, Raichur (Karnataka) is prohibited from carrying on 'banking business' 
as defined in Section 5(b) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949(AACS) including 
acceptance and repayment of deposits.
