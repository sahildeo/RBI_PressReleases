RBI cautions Public about Unauthorised Companies collecting Deposits 
 
The Reserve Bank of India has today cautioned members of public about 
unauthorised companies which collect money from public stating that they have been 
authorised by the Reserve Bank to do so. The Reserve Bank stated that it has 
published on its website (http://rbi.org.in/scripts/BS_NBFCList.aspx) a list of non-
banking finance companies (NBFCs) which are permitted to accept deposits. No 
NBFC outside of this list can accept deposits from public. Doing so is clearly 
fraudulent and has to be investigated by the law enforcement agencies in the normal 
course. 
 
The Reserve Bank has also been advertising from time to time cautioning the 
public about this. 
 
The Reserve Bank has further stated that all complaints relating to 
unauthorised acceptance of monies and running of money circulation schemes 
should be referred to the Economic Offences Wing of the concerned State 
Governments. 
 
It was reported that some individuals/firms/unincorporated association of 
individuals (unincorporated bodies)/ marketing companies and companies engaged 
in money circulation schemes have been collecting monies from the public by 
making tall promises of high returns, either through issue of advertisements or by 
sale of products.  Some of them even claim that they have the Reserve Bankís 
approval for their operations. Some of these entities have reportedly vanished 
without repaying the monies collected by them. 
 
Money circulation schemes are banned under the Prize Chit and Money 
Circulation Schemes (Banning) Act 1978 and the respective State Governments 
have the power to take action against the persons involved in such schemes.
