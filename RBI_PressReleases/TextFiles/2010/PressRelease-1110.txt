The Reserve Bank Staff Studies SS(DEAP): 2/2010 titled ëMonetary Policy Behaviour 
in India: Evidence from Taylor-Type Policy Frameworksí 
The Reserve Bank of India today published its Staff Study SS (DEAP): 2/2010 
entitled ëMonetary Policy Behaviour in India: Evidence from Taylor-Type Policy 
Frameworksí. The Staff Study, authored by Bhupal Singh, examines the response of 
monetary policy in India to inflation and output gap in the framework of Taylor rule. 
  Taylor rule, proposed by John B. Taylor in 1993, is a monetary-policy rule that 
specifies how much the central bank should change the nominal interest rate in response to 
divergences of actual inflation rates from the target inflation rates and of actual output from 
the potential output. A large part of the discussion of monetary policy on the Taylor rule 
relates to how the monetary policy should be conducted and how far the actual conduct of 
policy deviates from the rule-based parameters. The accommodative monetary policies 
globally after the recession of the early 2000s rates for too long has been in violation of the 
Taylor rule.  
Contextually, the key motivation for this study is to understand the shifts in the 
relative weights that the monetary policy in India might have accorded to deviations in 
inflation and output ñ the key objectives of monetary policy. The study examines the 
interest rate path suggested by simple monetary policy rules in India. The relevance of 
such rules is that an analysis of what a rule-based monetary policy would suggest, can 
serve as a valuable guide for the exercise of discretion by the policy makers.   
The reaction function has been estimated using ordinary least squares or 
instrumental variables in case of backward looking functions and using generalised method 
of moments in case of forward looking rules, as is the practice in standard empirical 
literature. In addition to the study also analyses monetary policy stance in India in a 
structural VAR model with output gap, inflation gap and policy interest rate. The structural 
VAR model has been used to calibrate the findings emerging from the static models. 
A range of estimated models for Taylor rule in India in a historical perspective 
suggest that while the monetary policy appeared more responsive to the output gap than to 
the inflation gap during the period 1950-51 to 1987-88, there is a shift in policy response 
during the period 1988-89-2008-09 with relatively strong reaction to inflation gap than to the 
output gap. There is also evidence of more than proportional response of monetary policy 
to inflation gap in the latter period. The size of the coefficient of inflation gap has also 
increased significantly over time, which suggests a shift in the emphasis of monetary policy 
towards inflation concerns. An important difference in the interest rate smoothing behaviour 
of the central bank is a shift from large smoothing of short-term interest rates towards the 
rates recommended by Taylor rule in the earlier period to relatively gradual adjustment of 
short-term interest rates in the latter period. This is consistent with the measured actions of 
central bank given the uncertainties surrounding the economic environment and the 
transmission of policy rates. The estimates from a structural VAR framework also firmly 
establish that variations in the short-term interest rates are driven more by the inflation gap 
than the output gap.
