RBI Staff Study  
Internationalisation of Currency :  
The case of the Indian Rupee and Chinese Renminbi  
The Reserve Bank of India today published a Staff Study entitled 
ëInternationalisation of Currency: The case of the Indian Rupee and the Chinese 
Renminbi.í  Authored by Dr. Rajiv Ranjan and Shri Anand Prakash, the study 
examines the costs and benefits associated with internationalisation of currency with 
specific cases of the Chinese renminbi and the Indian rupee. It also examines 
whether Indian rupee could be a candidate for internationalisation. 
Context 
The recent global economic downturn and weakness of the US dollar in the 
international market has prompted a wide-ranging debate on the need for a new 
global reserve currency. It is quite unlikely that the dollar will lose its predominance 
as global reserve currency in the foreseeable future. The current crisis has, however, 
thrown open the debate on the need for a new global reserve currency in case the 
US economy fails to make a significant turnaround and the weakness of the US 
dollar persists making its continuance as a global reserve currency unsustainable.  
The issue of a new global reserve currency is attracting the attention of policy 
makers all over the world in recent times. The issue has assumed significance for 
Asian central banks, including the Reserve Bank of India, which have invested a 
significant proportion of their reserves in dollar denominated assets. Any sharp 
depreciation in the value of the dollar would entail significant losses to these central 
banks. The moot question, however, is which currency is capable of replacing the 
US dollar in the medium to long-term. China has already stepped up its efforts 
towards greater internationalisation of renminbi.  
The study is descriptive and analytical in nature and draws upon various 
recent studies on the issue of internationalisation of currency, especially in the 
context of Chinese renminbi. The study thus provides an in-depth analysis of various 
issues pertaining to internationalisation of the Chinese renminbi and the Indian 
rupee. 
The case of Chinese Renminbi 
Detailing the various issues pertaining to internationalisation of the Chinese 
renminbi and the Indian rupee, the study argues that among the emerging market 
currencies, renminbi and Indian rupee are natural contenders for an international 
currency status.  This is on account of increasing economic prowess of these 
countries and their ability to withstand the adverse impact of the global financial 
crisis with relatively greater ease.  The study notes that Chinese authorities have 
taken a number of steps to bring about greater internationalisation of renminbi which  2
is already visible in transactions with its neighbouring economies. China has, for 
instance, promulgated provisional rules governing the issuance of renminbi-
denominated bonds by international development institutions; allowing non-residents 
to issue in Chinese markets the so-called panda bonds; People's Bank of China 
(PBOC) has entered into a series of bilateral currency swap agreements whereby 
the PBOC and other central banks have agreed to exchange the renminbi (not the 
US dollar) with the respective counterparty currencies, mainly for supporting trade 
between these countries; Hong Kong is increasingly becoming an offshore Renminbi 
trading center and the Chinese government is fully supports the move. 
According to the authors of the study, for China, the greatest advantage in 
renminbi internationalisation is reduced foreign exchange risk for Chinese 
enterprises. The renminbi's internationalisation will also enhance the international 
competitiveness of Chinese financial institutions. Furthermore, when the renminbi 
gains wide acceptance as an international currency, China will enjoy the additional 
benefit of seigniorage. On the other hand, one major drawback of renminbiís 
internationalisation would be China's increased susceptibility to the inflows and 
outflows of international hot money.  
In view of the authors, the renminbi is far from ready to achieve reserve 
currency status at the moment. Progress towards Renminbi internationalisation 
depends not only on China's own cost-and-benefit calculation but also on China's 
share in the world economy, confidence of global markets and well functioning 
financial market in China. Before the Renminbi becomes fully convertible, the 
offshore renminbi market will have to be in place. Apart from economic aspects, 
political elements are equally important for the renminbi internationalisation, say the 
authors. The renminbi is likely to become a regional currency because of Chinaís 
expanding trade links before it gains acceptance as an international reserve 
currency, the study concludes.  
The case of Indian Rupee 
In view of the authors, India needs to proactively take steps to increase the 
role of the Indian rupee in the region. They conclude this after noting that significant 
strength exhibited by the Indian rupee in the recent months and continued good 
performance of the Indian economy have raised the issue of greater 
internationalisation of the Indian rupee. Indiaís has so far followed a calibrated 
approach towards capital account liberalisation. India, at present, does not permit 
rupee to be officially used for international transactions except those with Nepal and 
Bhutan though there are indications of Indian rupee gaining acceptability in other 
countries. There are, however, problems associated with Internationalisation of the 
rupee as it could increase volatility of its exchange rate. Withdrawal of short-term 
funds and portfolio investments by non-residents could also be a major potential risk 
of internationalisation of the Indian rupee. Unlike China, which runs a large current 
account surplus, India generally runs a significant trade and current account deficits. 
The Indian rupee is rarely being used for invoicing of international trade. Further, all 
the necessary preconditions need to be in place before India could proceed further 
on the issue of internationalisation of the rupee.
