Comptroller and Auditor General and the Reserve Bank of India. The State Finance 
Secretaries play a key role in the development process of their respective States 
and strive to achieve transparency, stability, fairness and efficiency in the conduct of 
fiscal policies. The deliberations in the past conferences have served to arrive at a 
consensus on various issues in furtherance of better financial management and 
fiscal prudence in the States.  
Today's Conference aimed to take this consultative process further. Dr. Vijay 
Kelkar, former Chairman, and Shri Sumit Bose, former Secretary, Thirteenth Finance

Thirteenth Finance Commission. The Conference also deliberated on the 
recommendations of the Working Group of the State Finance Secretaries on State 
Fiscal Responsibility Legislation: The Next Phase (Chairman: Prof. D.K.Srivastava). 
Apart from the discussions on the two Reports, the deliberations in the Conference 
primarily focused on issues relating to surplus cash balances of the State Governments, projections on market borrowings of the State Governments, issuance 
of quarterly indicative calendars for borrowing by the States, financial inclusion, 
financial literacy and Lead Bank Scheme and operational issues pertaining to RBIís 
role as banker to the State Governments, such as, State Government business, 
compensation bonds, RBIís secured internet website for government transactions 
and cyber treasury transactions.
