Reserve Bank Cancels the Licence of The Ahmedabad Peoplesí 
Co-operative Bank Ltd., Ahmedabad (Gujarat) 
In view of the fact that The Ahmedabad Peoplesí Co-operative Bank Ltd., 
Ahmedabad (Gujarat), had ceased to be solvent, all efforts to revive it in close 
consultation with the Government of Gujarat had failed and the depositors were being 
inconvenienced by continued uncertainty, the Reserve Bank of India delivered the order 
cancelling its licence to the bank after the close of business on January 08, 2010. The 
Registrar of Co-operative Societies, Gujarat has also been requested to issue an order 
for winding up the bank and appoint a liquidator for the bank. It may be highlighted that 
on liquidation, every depositor is entitled to repayment of his/her deposits up to a 
monetary ceiling of Rs.1,00,000/- (Rupees One lakh only) from the Deposit Insurance 
and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) under usual terms and conditions.  
The bank was granted a licence by Reserve Bank of India on June 07, 1995 to 
commence banking business. A snap scrutiny of the bank conducted in May 2007 
revealed that the bank had violated RBI directives/instructions/guidelines on conduct of 
Insurance business, exposure ceiling, etc. 
The subsequent statutory inspections of the bank with respect to its position as 
on March 31, 2008 and March 31, 2009 revealed that its financial position had 
deteriorated and was precarious. Due to precarious financial position and the liquidity 
crunch faced by the bank, it was placed under directions with effect from May 13, 2009 
vide Directive UBD.NSB II No. D-43/12.21.03/2008-09 dated May 13, 2009. The 
Reserve Bank of India issued a show cause notice to the bank on October 06, 2009 
asking it to show cause as to why the licence granted to it on June 07, 1995 to conduct 
banking business should not be cancelled. The bankís reply to the show cause notice 
was examined. The bank did not have a viable plan of action for its revival. In the 
absence of any viable proposal for turnaround and means to achieve the required 
regulatory prescriptions the possibility of revival of the bank was remote. Therefore, the 
Reserve Bank of India took the extreme measure of cancelling licence of the bank in 
the interest of the bank's depositors. With the cancellation of its licence and 
commencement of liquidation proceedings, the process of paying the depositors of the 
Ahmedabad Peoplesí Co-operative Bank Ltd., Ahmedabad (Gujarat) will be set in 
motion subject to the terms and conditions of the Deposit Insurance Scheme.  
Consequent to the cancellation of its licence, The Ahmedabad Peoplesí Co-
operative Bank Ltd., Ahmedabad (Gujarat) is prohibited from carrying on ëbanking 
businessí as defined in Section 5(b) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (AACS) 
including acceptance and repayment of deposits.
