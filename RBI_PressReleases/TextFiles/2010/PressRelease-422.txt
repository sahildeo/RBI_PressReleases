RBI Staff Study on 
ìCentral Bank Balance Sheets Amidst Recent Global Crisis: 
Issues in Future Monetary Managementî 
The Reserve Bank of India today released a Staff Study titled ëCentral Bank 
Balance Sheets Amidst Recent Global Crisis: Issues in Future Monetary 
Management,í by Shri S. M. Lokare from Department of Economic Policy and 
Research.  
The recent global financial crisis triggered a spate of policy responses that 
were unparalleled in terms of their alacrity, scale, magnitude and exceptional 
coordination across various jurisdictions. The use of central bank balance sheets, in 
particular, as a key instrument of monetary policy received unprecedented focus 
during the recent crisis. In this context, this study examines the impact of policy 
actions taken during the crisis on the balance sheets of central banks, besides 
outlining the future challenges and lessons in the management of assets and 
liabilities in the balance sheets of central banks during the course of exit. It also 
analyses the Indian context, narrating particularly as to how it was different from the 
trends in central banks of advanced countries.  
Major observations of the study are as follows: 
ï The assets of the Fed and the Bank of England more than doubled, that too in 
a matter of weeks, while that of the European Central Bank (ECB) grew by 
more than 30 per cent. In the Fedís case, this reflected direct lending to banks 
and dealers through existing and new lending facilities; indirect lending to 
money market funds; purchases of commercial papers (CP) through special 
purpose vehicles and drawings by foreign central banks on dollar swap lines.  
ï In Europe, the key drivers of ECB balance sheet covered enhanced credit 
support measures along with standing facilities, which involved increasing the 
number, frequency of operations and the list of eligible collaterals. Balance 
sheet changes with respect to the Bank of Japan ( BoJ) were mainly driven by 
introduction of measures to facilitate corporate financing, along with the 
purchase of CPs and corporate bonds.  
ï Several challenges emerged from significant changes in the size of central 
bank balance sheets, such as change to the risk profile of balance sheets with 
rise in credit, valuation and counter-party risks apart from interest rate risks; 
change in the income position of central banks; excess reserves restraining 
the willingness of banks to lend; lack  of marketability  of  certain  types  of  
assets  and  illiquid  claims  impeding  the operational flexibility and  2
constraining future monetary management and apprehensions about 
operational and financial independence of central banks.  
ï Successful disengagement would require coherent sequencing and clear 
communications from the central banks. Specific unwinding plans need to be 
calibrated while providing signals to markets on achieving medium-term policy 
goals, while avoiding the risk of a premature withdrawal of support as 
conditions look still fragile.  
ï Although several emerging market economies (EMEs) resorted to various 
measures for expanding liquidity, both in domestic currency and in foreign 
currency, the size of central bank balance sheets in EMEs increased much 
less than their counterparts in advanced economies, due to absence of 
aggressive quantitative and credit easing measures and the rundown in 
international reserves in many cases on account of capital outflows in the 
aftermath of the crisis.  
ï In India, despite some pressure on financial markets in the aftermath of 
September 2008, with RBI ensuring ample rupee and forex liquidity in the 
system, normalcy and orderly conditions were restored in the markets. Unlike 
other countries, RBIís balance sheet did not expand as two important 
measures injected ample liquidity in the financial system, i.e., reduction in 
CRR and unwinding of MSS balances of the Government with the RBI, which 
actually led to contraction in the balance sheet.
