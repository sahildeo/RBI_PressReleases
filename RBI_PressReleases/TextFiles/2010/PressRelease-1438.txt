Reserve Bank Cancels the Licence of  
Dhanashri Mahila Sahakari Bank Ltd., Miraj, Dist. Sangli, Maharashtra 
 
In view of the fact that the Dhanashri Mahila Sahakari Bank Ltd., Miraj, Dist. 
Sangli, Maharashtra, had ceased to be solvent, all efforts to revive it in close 
consultation with the Government of Maharashtra had failed and the depositors were 
being inconvenienced by continued uncertainty, the Reserve Bank of India delivered 
the order cancelling its licence to the bank after the close of business on March 12, 
2010. The Registrar of Co-operative Societies, Maharashtra has also been 
requested to issue an order for winding up the bank and appoint a liquidator for the 
bank. It may be highlighted that on liquidation, every depositor is entitled to 
repayment of his/her deposits up to a monetary ceiling of Rs. 1,00,000/- (Rupees 
One lakh only) from the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation 
(DICGC) under usual terms and conditions.  
 
 The bank was granted a licence by Reserve Bank of India on March 04, 1997 
to commence banking business. The Statutory Inspection of the bank conducted by 
the Reserve Bank of India with reference to its financial position as on March 31, 
2006 revealed deterioration in its financial position. Certain operational restrictions 
were imposed on the bank.  
 
The latest Statutory Inspection of the bank with reference to its financial 
position as on March 31, 2009 revealed severe deterioration in its financial position. 
Accordingly, Reserve Bank of India imposed all-inclusive directions under Section 
35A of the Banking Regulation Act 1949 (As Applicable to Co-operative Societies) 
with a ceiling of Rs. 1000/- on withdrawal of deposits, vide directive dated 
September 14, 2009.  
 
The bank was served a notice dated October 15, 2009, calling on it to show 
cause as to why the licence granted to it under Section 22 of the Banking Regulation 
Act, 1949 (As Applicable to Co-operative Societies) on March 04, 1997 to carry on 
banking business, should not be cancelled and why steps should not be taken to 
wind up the bank. Bankís reply dated October 29, 2009 to the show cause notice 
was examined and was found unsatisfactory. The bank also did not come out with 
any concrete plan for revival or any proposal for its merger. 
  
Considering the sharp deterioration in its financial position as on March 31, 
2009 and the absence of any concrete proposal for merger, there was no possibility 
of revival of the bank. Therefore, the Reserve Bank of India took the extreme  2
measure of canceling the licence of the bank in the interest of the bank's depositors. 
With the cancellation of its licence and commencement of liquidation proceedings, 
the process of paying the depositors of Dhanashri Mahila Sahakari Bank Ltd., Miraj, 
Dist. Sangli, Maharashtra, will be set in motion subject to the terms and conditions of 
the Deposit Insurance Scheme. 
 
Consequent to the cancellation of its licence, Dhanashri Mahila Sahakari 
Bank Ltd., Miraj, Dist. Sangli, Maharashtra, is prohibited from carrying on ëbanking 
businessí as defined in Section 5(b) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (As 
applicable to Co-operative Societies) including acceptance and repayment of 
deposits.
