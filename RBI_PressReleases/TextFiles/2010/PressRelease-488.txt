Developments in India's Balance of Payments during the First Quarter 
(April-June) of 2010-11  
Preliminary data on Indiaís balance of payments (BoP) for the first quarter 
(Q1) i.e., April-June 2010 of the financial year 2010-11, are now available. The 
details of these data are set out in the standard format of BoP presentation in 
Statements I and II.  
Major Highlights of BoP 
(i) Exports recorded a growth of 37.2 per cent during Q1 of 2010-11, on a year-on-
year basis, as against a decline of 31.8 per cent during Q1 of 2009-10.  
(ii) Imports registered a growth of 35.7 per cent during Q1 of 2010-11 as against a 
decline of 21.7 per cent during Q1 of 2009-10. 
(iii) Despite higher growth in exports relative to imports, the trade deficit widened 
during Q1 of 2010-11.  
(iv) Services receipts recorded a growth of 22.5 per cent, on a year-on-year basis, 
led by travel, transportation, software, business and financial services.  
(v) Private transfer receipts continued to be robust during Q1 of 2010-11. 
(vi) Net invisibles, however, declined owing to relatively higher invisibles payments 
driven particularly by higher payments under investment income and also by 
larger payments on account of travel, transportation, business and financial 
services. 
(vii) The higher trade deficit combined with the lower invisibles surplus resulted in 
the widening of current account deficit during Q1 of 2010-11. 
(viii) The capital account surplus increased significantly, over the corresponding 
quarter of last year, mainly due to short-term credit, external commercial 
borrowings (ECBs), external assistance and banking capital. 
(ix) Net foreign investment, however, was much lower than the corresponding 
quarter of last year mainly due to significant moderation in net inflows under 
foreign institutional investors (FIIs) investments. Net inflows under foreign direct 
investment (FDI) were also lower during the Q1 of 2010-11.   
(x) With capital account surplus being higher than the current account deficit, the 
overall balance was in surplus at US$ 3.7 billion, which resulted in a net 
accretion to foreign exchange reserves of equivalent amount during the Q1 of 
2010-11.

(i) On a BoP basis, Indiaís merchandise exports recorded a growth of 37.2 per 
cent, on a year-on-year basis, in Q1 of 2010-11 as against a decline of 31.8 per 
cent in Q1 of 2009-10.  
(ii) Merchandise imports registered a growth of 35.7 per cent during Q1 of 2010-11 
as against a decline of 21.7 per cent during Q1 of 2009-10.   
(iii) Notwithstanding higher growth in exports relative to imports, the trade deficit, 
on a BoP basis, was higher at US$ 34.2 billion in Q1 of 2010-11 as compared 
with US$ 25.6 billion during Q1 of 2009-10. 
(iv) Invisibles receipts recorded a growth of 13.6 per cent, on year-on-year basis, 
during Q1 of 2010-11 (as against a decline of 4.6 per cent during Q1 of 2009-
10) mainly led by services exports.  
(v) Services exports registered a growth of 22.5 per cent (as against a decline of 
7.5 per cent a year ago) led by travel and transportation as well as 
miscellaneous services such as software, business and financial services.   
(vi) Private transfer receipts increased moderately by 3.0 per cent (as compared 
with the growth of 5.1 per cent a year ago) to US$ 13.7 billion during Q1 of 
2010-11. 
(vii) Investment income receipts declined marginally by 3.5 per cent during the 
quarter (as against a sharper decline of 20.3 per cent a year ago) mainly due to 
persistence of lower interest rates abroad.     
(viii) Invisibles payments recorded a growth of 35.5 per cent (as against a decline of 
5.7 per cent a year ago) mainly due to higher payments under investment 
income and also on account of higher payments under travel, transportation, 
business and financial services (Table 2).

(ix) As growth in invisibles payments was higher than the growth in receipts, net 
invisibles (invisibles receipts minus invisibles payments) recorded a moderate 
decline of 3.4 per cent to US$ 20.5 billion during the quarter (US$ 21.2 billion 
during Q1 of 2009-10). 
(x) The lower size of invisibles surplus coupled with a higher trade deficit resulted 
in an increase in current account deficit during Q1 of 2010-11 to US$ 13.7 
billion (US$ 4.5 billion during Q1 of 2009-10).  
(xi) The continued buoyancy in capital inflows mainly led by large inflows under 
short-term credit, external commercial borrowings and external assistance as 
well as banking capital, resulted in a net capital account surplus of US$ 18.4 
billion during Q1 of 2010-11 as compared with a lower surplus of US$ 4.0 billion 
during Q1 of 2009-10.  
(xii) Short-term trade credit to India recorded a large net inflow of US$ 5.6 billion in 
Q1 of 2010-11 (as against a net outflow of US$ 1.5 billion during Q1 of 2009-
10) in line with increase in imports associated with strong domestic economic 
activity and improved conditions in the global financial markets.   
(xiii) Net ECBs were significantly higher at US$ 2.7 billion during the quarter (as 
against a decline of US$ 0.4 billion in Q1 of 2009-10) mainly due to higher 
disbursements of commercial loans to India coupled with lower repayments. 
(xiv) Banking capital recorded net inflows of US$ 4.0 billion during the quarter (as 
against net outflows of US$ 3.4 billion in Q1 of 2009-10) mainly due to net 
inflows under Non-resident Indian (NRI) deposits and overseas foreign 
currency borrowings of banks. The drawdown of foreign assets of commercial 
banks also contributed to the increase in inflows.   4
(xv) Net FDI flows (net inward FDI minus net outward FDI) amounted to US$ 
3.2 billion during the quarter (almost half of the level in Q1 of 2009-10) mainly 
due to lower net inward FDI (at US$ 6.0 billion in Q1 of 2010-11 as compared 
with US$ 8.7 billion in Q1 of 2009-10). Net outward FDI was marginally higher 
at US$ 2.8 billion (US$ 2.6 billion in Q1 of 2009-10). 
(xvi) The deceleration in FDI to India was mainly on account of lower FDI inflows 
under construction, real estate, business and financial services.   
(xvii) Net portfolio investments were also significantly lower at US$ 4.6 billion during 
the quarter (US$ 8.3 billion during Q1 of 2009-10), mainly due to deceleration in 
net FII flows largely on account of risk aversion by global investors following the 
sovereign debt crisis in the euro zone countries (Table 3). 
(xviii) There was an increase in foreign exchange reserves on BoP basis (i.e., 
excluding valuation) of US$ 3.7 billion during Q1 of 2010-11 as compared with 
a marginal increase of US$ 0.1 billion in Q1 of 2009-10. In nominal terms (i.e., 
including valuation changes), foreign exchange reserves declined by US$ 3.3 
billion during the quarter reflecting appreciation of US dollar against major 
international currencies during the quarter [A Press Release on the Sources of 
Variation in Foreign Exchange Reserves is separately issued].
