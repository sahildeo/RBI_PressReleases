Developments in India's Balance of Payments during the Second 
Quarter (July-September 2010) and Partially Revised data for First Quarter 
(April-June 2010) of 2010-11  
Preliminary data on Indiaís balance of payments (BoP) for the second quarter 
(Q2) - July-September 2010 of the financial year 2010-11, are now available. These 
preliminary data and the partially revised data for the first quarter (Q1) i.e., April-June 
2010, have been taken into account for compiling the BoP data for the first half of the 
current financial year, i.e., April-September 2010. The data for past two years have 
also been revised. The details of these data are set out in the standard format of 
BoP presentation in Statements I and II.  
Major Highlights of BoP during July-September (Q2) of 2010-11 
(i) On a BoP basis, exports recorded a growth of 25.0 per cent, year-on-year, 
during Q2 of 2010-11 as against a decline of 19.1 per cent during 
corresponding quarter of 2009-10.  
(ii) Similarly, on a BoP basis, imports registered a growth of 22.8 per cent, year-on-
year, during the quarter as against a decline of 21.3 per cent during same 
quarter last year. 
(iii) Despite higher growth in exports relative to imports, in absolute terms the trade 
deficit widened to US$ 35.4 billion as compared to US$ 29.6 billion during 
corresponding quarter last year.  
(iv) Services receipts recorded a growth of 39.6 per cent, on a year-on-year basis, 
led by travel, transportation, software, business and financial services. During 
the corresponding quarter of last year, services receipts had declined by 26.3 
per cent. 
(v) Services payments increased by 40.7 per cent to US$ 19.3 billion during the 
quarter from US$ 13.7 billion in corresponding quarter of last year   
(vi) Private transfer receipts declined by 5.0 per cent to US$ 13.5 billion during the 
quarter. 
(vii) Consequently, net invisibles receipts declined by 3.9 per cent to US$ 19.6 
billion.  
(viii) The higher trade deficit combined with the lower invisibles surplus resulted in 
the widening of current account deficit. 
(ix) The capital account surplus increased over the corresponding quarter of last 
year, mainly due to portfolio investments, short-term credit and external  2
commercial borrowings (ECBs). Net inflows under FDI witnessed significant 
moderation during the second quarter compared to the corresponding quarter 
of last year.  
(x) With capital account surplus being higher than the current account deficit, the 
overall balance was in surplus at US$ 3.3 billion, which resulted in a net 
accretion to foreign exchange reserves of equivalent amount during the Q2 of 
2010-11. 
Major Highlights of BoP during April-September (H1) of 2010-11 
(i) During April-September 2010, the current account deficit widened reflecting 
higher trade deficit combined with lower net invisibles surplus.  
(ii) Although net foreign investments were largely of the similar order, net capital 
inflows increased significantly mainly due to short-term trade credits and 
ECBs. 
(iii) Despite significant increase in net capital inflows, accretion to reserves during 
April-September 2010 was lower mainly due to more than doubling of current 
account deficit over April-September 2009.

(i) On a BoP basis, Indiaís merchandise exports recorded a growth of 25.0 per 
cent, year-on-year, during Q2 of 2010-11 as against a decline of 19.1 per cent 
in the same quarter last year.  
(ii) On a BoP basis, merchandise imports registered a growth of 22.8 per cent as 
against a decline of 21.3 per cent last year.    3
(iii) Notwithstanding higher growth in exports relative to imports, the trade deficit in 
absolute terms was higher at US$ 35.4 billion in Q2 of 2010-11 as compared 
with US$ 29.6 billion during Q2 of 2009-10. 
(iv) Invisibles receipts recorded a growth of 12.2 per cent (as against a decline of 
13.7 per cent last year) mainly led by services exports.  
(v) Services exports registered a growth of 39.6 per cent (as against a decline of 
26.3 per cent a year ago) led by travel and transportation as well as 
miscellaneous services such as software, business and financial services.   
(vi) Private transfer receipts declined by 5.0 per cent (as compared with the growth 
of 3.6 per cent a year ago) to US$ 13.5 billion during the quarter (Table 2). 
(vii) Investment income receipts declined significantly by 62.0 per cent during the 
quarter (as against an increase of 17.9 per cent a year ago) mainly due to 
persistence of lower interest rates abroad.     
(viii) Invisibles payments recorded a growth of 28.5 per cent (as against a marginal 
increase a year ago) mainly due to higher payments under travel, 
transportation, business and financial services.

(ix) As growth in invisibles payments was higher than the growth in receipts, net 
invisibles (invisibles receipts minus invisibles payments) recorded a moderate 
decline of 3.9 per cent to US$ 19.6 billion during the quarter (US$ 20.4 billion 
during Q2 of 2009-10). 
(x) The lower size of invisibles surplus coupled with a higher trade deficit resulted 
in an increase in current account deficit to US$ 15.8 billion (US$ 9.2 billion a 
year ago).  
(xi) The large inflows under FII investments along with steady inflows under short-
term credit and external commercial borrowings resulted in a net capital 
account surplus of US$ 20.5 billion during Q2 of 2010-11 as compared with a 
surplus of US$ 19.3 billion during Q2 of 2009-10.  
(xii) Short-term trade credit to India recorded net inflows of US$ 2.6 billion during 
the quarter (as compared with a net inflow of US$ 1.2 billion last year) in line 
with increase in imports associated with strong domestic economic activity.   
(xiii) Net ECBs were significantly higher at US$ 3.7 billion during the quarter (as 
compared with US$ 1.2 billion last year) mainly due to higher disbursements of 
commercial loans to India. 
(xiv) Banking capital recorded net outflows of US$ 3.2 billion during the quarter (as 
against net inflows of US$ 4.4 billion last year) mainly due to build up of foreign 
assets of commercial banks.  
(xv) Net FDI flows (net inward FDI minus net outward FDI) amounted to US$ 2.5 
billion during the quarter (almost a third of the level in Q2 of 2009-10) mainly 
due to lower net inward FDI during the quarter.  
(xvi) The deceleration in FDI to India was mainly on account of lower FDI inflows 
under construction, real estate, business and financial services. Country-wise, 
there was significant decline in FDI from Mauritius and Singapore.    
(xvii) Net inflows under portfolio investments almost doubled to US$ 19.2 billion 
during the quarter (US$ 9.7 billion during the same quarter last year), mainly 
due to large inflows under FIIs on the back of attractive returns in the Indian 
stock markets (Table 3). 
(xviii) Despite higher net capital inflows, increase in foreign exchange reserves on 
BoP basis (i.e., excluding valuation) was lower at US$ 3.3 billion during Q2 of 
2010-11 (as compared with accretion of US$ 9.4 billion during Q2 of 2009-10) 
due to larger current account deficits. In nominal terms (i.e., including valuation 
changes), foreign exchange reserves increased by US$ 17.2 billion during the 
quarter reflecting depreciation of US dollar against major international 
currencies during the quarter [A Press Release on the Sources of Variation in 
Foreign Exchange Reserves is separately issued].

2. Balance of Payments for April-September  (H1) of 2010-11  
 
(i) On BoP basis, the trade deficits widened to US$ 66.9 billion during April-
September 2010 (US$ 55.9 billion during April-September 2009). It was mainly 
due to significant increase in imports in line with robust domestic economic 
performance.  
(ii) Net invisibles surplus, however, were lower at US$ 39.1 billion during April-
September 2010 (US$ 42.5 billion last year) essentially due to higher invisibles 
payments under almost all major categories of services and decline in gross 
investment income receipts by about US$ 3 billion. 
(iii) The higher trade deficit combined with lower net invisibles surplus resulted in 
the widening of the current account deficit to US$ 27.9 billion during April-
September 2010 (US$ 13.3 billion last year). 
(iv) Net capital inflows increased significantly during April-September 2010 mainly 
due to FII inflows, short-term trade credits and ECBs. The large increase in 
these inflows was considerably offset by the moderation in net FDI inflows to 
India.  
(v) Notwithstanding significant increase in net capital inflows, accretion to reserves 
during April-September 2010 was lower mainly due to more than doubling of 
current account deficit over April-September 2009.  6
