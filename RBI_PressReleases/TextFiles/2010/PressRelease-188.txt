RBI Further Relaxes Liquidity Easing Measures 
In order to provide further liquidity comfort, the Reserve Bank of India has 
decided to:  
• Conduct Second Liquidity Adjustment Facility (SLAF) on a daily basis at 4.15 
p.m. up to January 28, 2011. 
• Allow Scheduled Commercial Banks to avail of additional liquidity support 
under the Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) to the extent of up to 2.0 per cent 
of their net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) as on the reporting Friday of 
the second preceding fortnight.  For any shortfall in Statutory Liquidity Ratio 
(SLR) maintenance up to January 28, 2011 arising out of availment of this 
facility, banks may seek waiver of penal interest on a fortnightly basis purely 
as an ad hoc, temporary measure. The liquidity support availed under this 
facility would, however, need to be reported on a daily basis. 
It may be recalled that in the Second Quarter Review (SQR) of Monetary 
Policy, 2010-11 announced on November 2, 2010, the Reserve Bank had stated that 
“even though a liquidity deficit is consistent with anti-inflation stance, excessive 
deficit in liquidity can be disruptive both, to financial markets and to credit growth in 
the banking system. To ensure that economic activity is not disrupted by liquidity 
constraints, the liquidity deficit needs to be contained within a reasonable limit.” 
In line with the stance of monetary policy set out in the SQR, the Reserve 
Bank took a number of steps including open market operations (OMO) and re-
introduced temporary measures on November 9, 2010; the SLAF on a daily basis at 
4.15 p.m. and additional liquidity support to SCBs under the LAF to the extent of up 
to 1.0 per cent of their NDTL as on the reporting Friday of the second preceding 
fortnight up to December 16, 2010. These measures were intended to provide 
liquidity comfort arising out of frictional liquidity pressures reflected in the LAF 
window of the Reserve Bank. The liquidity pressure has, however, continued. The 
liquidity injected by the Reserve Bank through its LAF window since November 8, 
2010 has averaged over `1,00,000 crore.
