RBI issues Guidelines for OTC Forex Derivatives and  
Overseas Hedging of Commodity Price and Freight Risks; 
Guidelines to be effective February 1, 2011 
The Reserve Bank of India has today issued Guidelines on Over the counter 
(OTC) Foreign Exchange Derivatives and Overseas Hedging of Commodity Price 
and Freight Risks. These guidelines will be effective from February 01, 2011. The 
important aspects of the revised guidelines are: 
• Providing lead time for submission of original documents. 
• Submission of quarterly statutory auditor certificates in respect of bookings 
made both, under the contracted exposure and past performance routes. 
• Allowing embedded cross currency option in case of foreign currency-Rupee 
swaps. 
• Permitting the use of cost reduction structures, both, under the contracted 
exposures and past performance routes, subject to certain safeguards like 
minimum net worth, compliance with AS 30/32, risk management capabilities 
of the corporate, turnover, tenor, etc. 
Background 
It may be recalled that the existing guidelines on OTC foreign exchange 
derivatives were reviewed in the context of developments in the international and 
domestic markets and the draft guidelines were placed on the Reserve Bank's 
website on November 12, 2009 for feedback from the market participants. The draft 
guidelines, inter alia, proposed to withdraw the facility of cost reduction structures 
and permit the clients/ customers to write covered call and put options and thereby 
receive premium in both foreign currency-Rupee options as well as cross currency 
options. Some of the stakeholders, particularly the Indian multinational corporations 
(MNCs) having global operations had represented that prohibitions on the use of 
cost reduction structures would impede their forex risk management operations and 
their global competitiveness.    
The feedback and suggestions received from the stakeholders were 
examined and discussed in detail at the meetings of the Technical Advisory 
Committee on Money, Foreign Exchange and Government Securities Markets, the 
Fixed Income Money Market Derivatives Association of India and the Foreign 
Exchange Dealers' Association of India. Considering the suggestions made by the 
market participants and other stakeholders, it was proposed to allow the use of cost 
reduction structures, subject to certain safeguards including suitability and 
appropriateness of the products.

The revised draft guidelines consisting of the proposed changes and 
modifications were again placed on the Reserve Bank's website on July 23, 2010 for 
another round of feedback from the various stakeholders. Several valuable 
suggestions from industry associations, banks, corporate, academics were received 
on the revised draft guidelines. The feedback was analysed and discussed with the 
stakeholders and based on the suggestions, the guidelines have now been finalised.
