RBI initiates Class Action to benefit Bank Customers; 
Annual Report of Banking Ombudsman Scheme-2008-2009 released 
 
The Reserve Bank of India has proactively started issuing general directions to 
all banks so as to protect the bank customers against banksí act of commissions and 
omissions. Called ëclass action,í such general directions are issued by the regulator in 
cases that could benefit not only the applicant but all those customers similarly placed 
without their having to approach their respective banks/ the Reserve Bank. 
 
The Reserve Bank has already initiated such class action against several banks. 
A class action, for instance, was initiated against a foreign bank regarding mode of 
calculation of interest rates on deposit accounts. Similarly a public sector bank was 
advised to recalculate interest rate on all the housing loans as per terms of the 
agreements entered into with all the borrowers without their application for relief. A yet 
another public sector bank was asked to recredit insurance premium which was debited 
to customerís savings bank account without his concurrence under group insurance 
scheme. The Customer Service Department of the Reserve Bank takes proactive action 
even on the basis of news published by newspapers or any other media.  
 
This was revealed in the Annual Report on the functioning of the Banking 
Ombudsman Scheme 2006. Dr. D. Subbarao, Governor, Reserve Bank of India 
released the Annual Report of the Banking Ombudsman Scheme at the annual 
conference of Banking Ombudsmen held here early this week. 
 
ï The Banking Ombudsmen received 69,117 complaints during 2008-09, as 
against 47,887 in 2007-08 (up by 44 per cent). 
ï Overall complaints received from rural areas increased by 65 per cent, semi 
urban areas by 48 per cent, urban areas by 36 per cent and metropolitan areas 
by 43 per cent during the year.   
ï While 43 per cent of the complaints were received from metropolitan areas, 23 
per cent were received from urban areas. Interestingly, 34 per cent of the 
complaints were received from rural and semi urban areas as against 32 per 
cent received during the previous year. 
ï Complaints against public sector banks, private sector banks and foreign banks 
increased by 29 per cent, 58 per cent and 91 per cent, respectively.  
ï Twenty-three per cent of complaints were received by email, 14 per cent through 
online application form available on the Reserve Bank website and 63 per cent in 
hard copy format.  
ï Complaints relating to credit cards/ATM cards (25.5 per cent) were the highest in 
2008-09 with complaints in this regard increasing by 74 per cent during the year.   
ï Up by 85 per cent, complaints relating to failure on commitments made (17 per 
cent) ranked second among the complaints received by the Banking  2
Ombudsmen. Other complaints related to deposits and remittances, 
maintenance of average quarterly balance, loans and advances, pension, direct 
selling and  recovery agents, processing/renewal/pre-closure charges being 
levied without due notice to the customers, etc. 
ï During the year 2008-09, banks and complainants appealed against as many as 
269 of the Banking Ombudsman's decisions. During the year 2007-08, banks 
and complainants had appealed against 186 of the Banking Ombudsmanís 
decisions. Most of the resolutions/awards passed by the Ombudsmen and the 
Appellate Authority, however, resulted in restoring what was legitimately due to 
the customer, along with compensation of Rs 5000 and upwards. The increased 
number of appeals indicates a fair understanding of the Scheme among 
customers. The Banking Ombudsman Scheme permits both, the banks and the 
complainants to appeal against the decision of the Banking Ombudsman. 
 
According to the Annual Report of Banking Ombudsman Scheme, increased 
awareness and easy accessibility of the offices of Banking Ombudsmen contributed to 
the increase in number of complaints received by Banking Ombudsmen. The reasons 
for larger number of complaints from the rural and semi urban areas were increased 
penetration of banking, increased awareness and increased expectations of customers 
in these areas, the Annual Report has noted. Banking Ombudsmen also brought about 
greater awareness in rural and semi urban areas through their personal visits as part of 
the Reserve Bank's outreach activities, media coverage of these visits and 
advertisements. The Annual Report further records: 
 
The full text of the report is available on the RBI website (www.rbi.org.in). 
 
Background 
 
The Reserve Bank notified the Banking Ombudsman Scheme in 1995, which 
has since been in operation. The Scheme was revised twice - in 2002 and 2006. The 
Scheme provides for a system of quick and inexpensive redressal of customer 
grievances against banks. The Banking Ombudsman Scheme covers a wide range of 
complaints concerning deficiency in banking service. The Scheme also allows appeals 
from complainants and banks in respect of decisions made by the Banking 
Ombudsman. The Scheme, as further amended on February 3, 2009, also includes 
complaints for deficiencies arising out of internet banking, non-adherence to the 
provisions of the Fair Practices Code for lenders or the Code of Bank's Commitment to 
Customers issued by the Banking Codes and Standards Board of India (BCSBI) and 
non-observance of the Reserve Bank guidelines on engagement of recovery agents by 
banks. In addition, the Reserve Bank has also simplified the format for lodging 
complaint to the Banking Ombudsman.  
 
The Reserve Bank organises a conference of all the Banking Ombudsmen every 
year. Senior officials from the Banking Codes and Standards Board of India, Indian 
Banksí Association, CIBIL and some leading banks are also invited. Various customer 
service related issues and regulatory measures for improving customer service in the 
banking sector are discussed in the meeting.
