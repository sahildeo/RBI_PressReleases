Developments in India's Balance of Payments during the Fourth Quarter (January-
March) of 2009-10 and for the full year (April-March) 2009-10 
 
Preliminary data on Indiaís balance of payments (BoP) for the fourth quarter 
(Q4) i.e., January-March 2010 of the financial year 2009-10, are now available. 
Based on these preliminary data and the partially revised data for the first three 
quarters i.e., April-June 2009 (Q1), July-September 2009 (Q2) and October-
December 2009 (Q3), the BoP data for the full year 2009-10 (April-March) have been 
compiled, which are set out in the standard format of BoP presentation in Statements 
I and II.  
Major Highlights of BoP 
January-March (Q4) of 2009-10 
(i) Exports recorded a growth of 36.2 per cent during Q4 of 2009-10 over the 
corresponding quarter of the previous year.  
(ii) Imports registered a growth of 43.0 per cent in Q4 of 2009-10 over the 
corresponding quarter of 2008-09. 
(iii) The trade deficit widened, reflecting higher growth in imports relative to exports.  
(iv) After four consecutive quarters of decline, on a year-on-year basis, services 
receipts recorded a growth of 13.4 per cent led by software and financial 
services. Private transfer receipts continued to be robust during Q4 of 2009-10. 
(v) Net invisibles, however, declined mainly on account of relatively higher 
invisibles payments due to larger payments on account of business, financial, 
communication and transportation services. 
(vi) The higher trade deficit combined with the lower invisibles surplus widened the 
current account deficit. 
(vii) The surplus in the capital account increased mainly due to portfolio investment 
and short-term trade credits. 
(viii) The overall balance was in surplus at US$ 2.1 billion, which resulted in a net 
accretion to foreign exchange reserves of equivalent amount. 
Financial Year 2009-10 (April-March) 
(i) On a BoP basis, the trade deficit decreased marginally to US$ 117.3 billion (8.9 
per cent of GDP) during 2009-10 from US$ 118.7 billion (9.8 per cent of GDP) a 
year ago. 
(ii) The current account deficit was higher at US$ 38.4 billion (2.9 per cent of GDP) 
during 2009-10, as compared with US$ 28.7 billion (2.4 per cent of GDP) during 
2008-09, mainly due to lower net invisibles surplus. 
1 
 (iii) The surplus in the capital account increased sharply to US$ 53.6 billion (4.1 per 
cent of GDP) during the year from US$ 7.3 billion (0.6 per cent of GDP) a year 
ago. 
(iv) As the surplus in the capital account exceeded the current account deficit, there 
was a net accretion to foreign exchange reserves of US$ 13.4 billion during 
2009-10 (as against a drawdown of reserves of US$ 20.1 billion during 2008-
09).

P: Preliminary.      PR: Partially Revised. 
 
(i) On a BoP basis, Indiaís merchandise exports recorded growth of 36.2 per cent 
in Q4 of 2009-10 as against a decline of 20.0 per cent in Q4 of 2008-09.  
(ii) On a BoP basis, imports registered growth of 43.0 per cent as against a decline 
of 20.8 per cent during Q4 of 2008-09.   
(iii) The trade deficit, on a BoP basis, was higher at US$ 31.5 billion in Q4 of 2009-
10 as compared with US$ 20.2 billion during Q4 of 2008-09. 
(iv) After witnessing four consecutive quarters of decline, on year-on-year basis, 
invisibles receipts recorded a growth of 15.4 per cent during Q4 of 2009-10 (as 
against a decline of 18.3 per cent during Q4 of 2008-09) mainly led by services 
and private transfers.  
(v) Services exports registered a growth of 13.4 per cent (as against a decline of 
9.7 per cent a year ago) led by trade related services such as transportation 
and insurance as well as miscellaneous services such as software and financial 
services.   
(vi) Private transfers receipts increased sharply by 33.3 per cent (as against a 
decline of 31.1 per cent a year ago). 
(vii) Investment income receipts declined by 23.5 per cent during the quarter mainly 
due to persistence of lower interest rates abroad.     
2 (viii) Invisibles payments recorded a growth of 34.3 per cent (as against a decline of 
20.8 per cent a year ago) mainly due to higher payments on account of 
transportation, business and financial services as well as steady payments 
under investment income.  
(ix)  As growth in invisibles payments was higher than the growth in receipts, net 
invisibles (invisibles receipts minus invisibles payments) recorded a decline of 
2.6 per cent to US$ 18.5 billion during the quarter. The decline was, however, 
lower as compared to Q4 of 2008-09, when it had declined by 15.8 per cent to 
US$ 19.0 billion. 
(x) The lower size of invisibles surplus coupled with a higher trade deficit resulted 
in an increase in current account deficit during Q4 of 2009-10 to US$ 13.0 
billion (US$ 1.2 billion during Q4 of 2008-09).  
(xi) The continued buoyancy in capital inflows, mainly led by large inflows under 
portfolio investments and short-term trade credits coupled with foreign direct 
investments, resulted in a net capital account surplus of US$ 16.1 billion during 
Q4 of 2009-10 as compared with a lower surplus of US$ 1.4 billion during Q4 of 
2008-09.  
(xii) Net FDI flows (net inward FDI minus net outward FDI) amounted to US$ 3.2 
billion during the quarter (almost same as that in Q4 of 2008-09). Net inward 
FDI stood at US$ 5.1 billion during the quarter (US$ 8.0 billion in Q4 of 2008-
09). Net outward FDI remained lower at US$ 1.9 billion (US$ 4.8 billion in Q4 of 
2008-09). 
(xiii)  Net portfolio investments were higher at US$ 8.8 billion, mainly supported by 
strong net inflows by the foreign institutional investors amounting to US$ 8.5 
billion during Q4 of 2009-10 (as against net outflows of US$ 2.6 billion by FIIs in 
Q4 of 2008-09). 
(xiv) Net External Commercial Borrowings (ECBs) were relatively low at US$ 0.1 
billion during the quarter (US$ 1.0 billion in Q4 of 2008-09) mainly due to 
increased repayments of commercial loans to India. Short-term trade credits to 
India recorded a net inflow of US$ 5.0 billion in Q4 of 2009-10 as against a net 
outflow of US$ 2.6 billion during Q4 of 2008-09.   
(xv) Banking capital recorded net outflows at US$ 0.9 billion during the quarter (as 
compared with net outflows of US$ 3.3 billion in Q4 of 2008-09) mainly due to 
build up of foreign assets of commercial banks.  
(xvi) There was an increase in foreign exchange reserves on BoP basis (i.e., 
excluding valuation) of US$ 2.1 billion in Q4 of 2009-10 as compared with an 
increase of US$ 0.3 billion in Q4 of 2008-09. In nominal terms (i.e., including 
valuation changes), foreign exchange reserves declined by US$ 4.4 billion 
during the quarter reflecting appreciation of US dollar against major 
international currencies during the quarter.

(i) On a BoP basis, Indiaís merchandise exports posted a decline of 3.6 per cent 
during 2009-10 (as against a growth of 13.7 per cent in the previous year).  
(ii) Import payments, on a BoP basis, also remained lower recording a decline of 
2.7 per cent (as compared with a growth of 19.4 per cent in the previous year).  
(iii) On a BoP basis, the merchandise trade deficit decreased marginally to US$ 
117.3 billion (8.9 per cent of GDP) during 2009-10 from US$ 118.7 billion (9.8 
per cent of GDP) in 2008-09. 
(iv) Invisibles receipts recorded a decline of 1.4 per cent (as against an increase of 
9.8 per cent in 2008-09), mainly due to lower receipts under miscellaneous 
services such as business, financial and communication services coupled with 
lower investment income receipts (Table 3).  
(v) Private transfer receipts, comprising mainly remittances from Indians working 
overseas, increased to US$ 53.9 billion in 2009-10 from US$ 46.9 billion in the 
previous year. Private transfer receipts constituted 15.7 per cent of current 
receipts in 2009-10 (13.3 per cent in 2008-09). Under Private transfers, the 
inward remittances for family maintenance accounted for about 56.1 per cent of 
the total private transfer receipts, while local withdrawals accounted for about 
43.7 per cent in 2009-10.

(vi) Software receipts at US$ 49.7 billion showed an increase of 7.4 per cent in 
2009-10 (compared with an increase of 14.9 per cent a year ago).  
(vii) Invisibles payments witnessed a higher growth of 11.8 per cent (0.6 per cent in 
2008-09) mainly due to higher business, financial and communication services, 
and increase in payments under investment income account.  
(viii) Net invisibles (invisibles receipts minus invisibles payments) stood at US$ 78.9 
billion during 2009-10 as compared with US$ 89.9 billion during 2008-09. At 
this level, the invisibles surplus financed 67.3 per cent of the trade deficit (as 
against 75.8 per cent during 2008-09). 
(ix) Despite a lower trade deficit, decline in invisibles surplus led to higher current 
account deficit at US$ 38.4 billion (US$ 28.7 billion in 2008-09).   
(x) Net capital flows at US$ 53.6 billion was much higher, as compared with US$ 
7.2 billion in 2008-09, mainly due to larger inflows under FDI, portfolio 
investments and short-term trade credits (Table 4).  
(xi) Due to lower outward FDI, the net FDI (inward FDI minus outward FDI) was 
higher at US$ 19.7 billion in 2009-10 as compared with US$ 17.5 billion in 
2008-09. 
(xii) Portfolio investment witnessed large net inflows of US$ 32.4 billion (as against 
a net outflow of US$ 14.0 billion in 2008-09) due to large net FII inflows of US$ 
29.0 billion.

(xiii) Net external commercial borrowings (ECBs) slowed down to US$ 2.5 billion 
(US$ 7.9 billion in 2008-09) mainly due to increased repayments. 
(xiv) Net short-term trade credits to India increased significantly to US$ 7.7 billion 
from net outflows of US$ 1.9 billion a year ago, reflecting the international 
confidence in domestic importers.   
(xv) The increase in foreign exchange reserves on a BoP basis (i.e., excluding 
valuation) was US$ 13.4 billion in 2009-10 (as against a sharp decline in 
reserves of US$ 20.1 billion in 2008-09). [A Press Release on the Sources of 
Variation in Foreign Exchange Reserves is separately issued].
