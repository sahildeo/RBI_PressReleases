RBI clarifies on compounding of contraventions under 
Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA), 1999 
 
The Reserve Bank of India has clarified that whether contraventions under 
Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) are to be treated as technical and/ or 
minor or serious would be decided by the Reserve Bank on the merits of the case. 
The case would accordingly be disposed of keeping in view the procedure notified in 
this regard. It has urged that persons who have contravened provisions of FEMA 
should not take upon themselves, suo moto or on the basis of external advice, to 
decide whether a particular contravention is of a technical or minor in nature and, 
hence, no compounding application need be submitted to the Reserve Bank. The 
Reserve Bank has further clarified that if such applications for compounding are not 
made, the person concerned shall expose himself/herself to such action under the 
provisions of FEMA as the authorities may deem appropriate. The persons 
concerned should, therefore, in their own interest, submit their applications for 
compounding of contravention under FEMA to the Reserve Bank at the earliest 
opportunity. 
 
 It may be recalled that in terms of A.P.(DIR Series) Circular No. 56 dated 
June 28, 2010, the Reserve Bank had notified the process of compounding which 
has been further rationalised and streamlined to enhance transparency and effect 
smooth implementation of the compounding process.
