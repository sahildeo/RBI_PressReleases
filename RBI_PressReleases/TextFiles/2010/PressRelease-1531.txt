Mandatory doubling of the limit for collateral free loans to micro and small 
enterprises (MSEs) sector to Rs. 10 lakh from the present Rs. 5 lakh, increase in the 
extent of guarantee cover, absorption of guarantee fees for the collateral free loans by 
CGTMSE subject to certain conditions, lower guarantee fees for women entrepreneurs 
and enterprises in the North-East, simplification of procedure  for filing claims with 
CGTMSE and increasing awareness about the scheme are some of the 
recommendations of the Working Group set up to review the Credit Guarantee Scheme 
of the Credit Guarantee Fund Trust. The setting up of the Working Group was 
announced in the (paragraph 114) Annual Policy statement for 2009-10. The Report 
was released by the Honíble Finance Minister Shri Pranab Mukherjee on March 6, 2010 
as part of the Platinum Jubilee celebrations of the Reserve Bank. 
 
The main recommendations of the Group are: 
 
1. Collateral free loans 
The limit for collateral free loans to the MSE sector to be increased from the present 
level of Rs. 5 lakh to Rs.10 lakh and it be made mandatory for banks.  
 
2. Guarantee  Fee  
 
a) The guarantee fee for collateral free loans upto Rs.10 lakh to Micro Enterprises to be 
borne/ absorbed by the CGTMSE subject to the proviso that the Trust be free to adjust 
the guarantee fee both downwards and upwards based on the modelling of the 
dynamically evolving distribution of claims. This will ensure that the CGTMSE remains 
self-financing and self-sustaining in the long-term.   
 
b) CGTMSE may charge composite, all-in guarantee fee of 1% p.a. and appropriately 
realign downwards the guarantee fees chargeable to women entrepreneurs, Micro 
enterprises and units located in North-Eastern Region including Sikkim. The Trust may 
also annually review the Guarantee Fee to be charged on the basis of the 
pricing/valuation model suggested by the Group. 
 
c) The Government of India to consider exempting both guarantee fee and the income 
on investments of the Trust from Income Tax, as is the practice internationally for such 
non-profit credit guarantee organisations. 
 
3. Extent of the Guarantee Cover 
 
Consistent with the recommendation for enhancement of the collateral free loan limit 
from Rs. 5 lakh to Rs. 10 lakh, the guarantee cover upto 85% of the amount in default to 
be made applicable to credit facilities to Micro Enterprises upto Rs 10 lakh.  However, 
the extent of guarantee cover for credit facilities above Rs.10 lakh upto Rs.50 lakh will 
be 75% and for credit facilities in excess of Rs.50 lakh upto Rs.1 crore will be 75% upto  2
Rs. 50 lakh and 50% of the amount in excess of Rs. 50 lakh, as per the extant 
provisions of the Scheme.  
 
4. Corpus of the Guarantee Trust 
If the CGTMSE uses the conceptually rigorous and technically robust model suggested 
by the Group, there is only 0.1 per cent chance that the Fund will be touched. However, 
as and when required, the Government of India may contribute to the Fundís corpus. 
 
5. Simplification of Procedure 
 
a) At present banks have to initiate legal action in all cases before filing claim with the 
Guarantee Trust. With a view to simplifying the procedure for filing claims in respect of 
small loan accounts, initiation of legal proceedings as a pre-condition for invoking of 
guarantees  to be waived for credit facilities upto Rs.50,000-.  
b) Member Lending Institutions (MLIs) of the Trust may be allowed to invoke guarantee 
within a period of two years from the date of classification of the account as NPA instead 
of the present prescription of within one year. 
c) The final claim to be paid by the Trust to the MLIs after three years of obtention of 
decree of recovery instead of the present procedure of releasing the final claim by the 
Trust only after the decree of recovery becomes time barred i.e. 12 years after obtaining 
decree.   
 
6. Awareness about the Scheme 
 
The Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) of banks should assume complete and total 
ownership in the matter of strongly encouraging the branch level functionaries to avail of 
the CGS cover, including making performance in this regard a criterion in the evaluation 
of their field staff.   
The implementation of the Recommendations of the Working Group should result in 
enhanced usage of the Guarantee Scheme and facilitate increase in quality and quantity 
of credit to the presently included, as well as excluded, MSEs, leading eventually, to 
sustainable inclusive growth.  
 
Background 
 
Having regard to the imperative of accelerating the flow of credit to the Micro and Small 
Enterprises (MSEs) sector, which is very critical for inclusive and equitable growth and 
larger economic empowerment, it was announced in the (paragraph 114) Annual Policy

Credit Guarantee Scheme so as to make it more effective.î  Following this 
announcement, a working group was constituted under the Chairmanship of Shri V.K. 
Sharma, Executive Director, Reserve Bank of India. The terms of reference of the Group

measures to enhance its usage and facilitate increased flow of collateral free loans to 
MSEs; ii) to make suggestions to simplify the existing procedures and requirements for

the feasibility of a whole turnover guarantee for the MSE portfolio; and iv) any other 
issues. Chairman and Managing Director of SIDBI, representatives of the Government 
of India, banks and IBA were Members of the Working Group and the Chief Executive
