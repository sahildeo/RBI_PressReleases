RBI releases Summer 2010 issue of Its Occasional Papers 
  
The Reserve Bank of India today released the Summer 2010 issue of its 
Occasional Papers. Occasional Papers is a research journal of the Reserve Bank 
and contains contributions of its staff and reflects the views of the authors. These 
issues are woven around some important themes which are in the forefront of policy 
discussions. These issues also contain special notes and book reviews. 
 
This issue includes four papers. The first paper titled ‘Measuring Market Risk - 
An Application of Value-at-risk to Select Government Bonds in India’ by        G. P. 
Samanta, Prithwis Jana, Angshuman Hait and Vivek Kumar explores the role of  
Value-at-Risk (VaR), which is a widely used tool for measuring the market risk of 
asset portfolios. Banks, which adopt ‘internal model approach’ (IMA) of the Basel 
Accord, require to quantify market risk through their own VaR model. They need to 
maintain minimum capital for the quantified risk as prescribed by the regulator. A 
challenging task before banks and risk managers, therefore, has been the selection 
of appropriate risk model from a wide and heterogeneous set of potential 
alternatives. In practice, selection of risk model for a portfolio has to be decided 
empirically. This paper makes an empirical attempt to select a suitable VaR model 
for government securities market in India. Empirical results show that returns on 
these bonds do not follow a normal distribution – the distribution possess fat-tails 
and at times, are skewed. The observed non-normality of the return distributions, 
particularly fat-tails, adds great difficulty in the estimation of VaR. The paper 
focusses more on demonstrating the steps involved in such a task with the help of 
select bonds. The paper evaluates a number of competing models/methods for 
estimating VaR for selected government bonds. The paper also tries to address non-
normality of returns suitably, while estimating VaR, using a number of non-normal 
VaR models, such as, historical simulation, risk metric, hyperbolic distribution fit, 
method based on tail-index.  
 
The paper by Sunil Kumar titled ‘Determinants of Real Exchange Rate in 
India: An ARDL Approach’ attempts to identify determinants of real exchange rate in 
India. Apart from providing a theoretical background on possible determinants of real 
exchange rate, the paper tests their statistical significance using autoregressive 
distributed lag (ARDL) modelling approach. It finds that among the identified 
variables chosen a priori, based on theoretical arguments as determinants of Real 
Exchange Rate (RER), productivity differential, external openness, terms of trade 
and net foreign assets turn out to be statistically significant. The signs of the short-
run dynamic impact have been found consistent with long-run coefficients and error 
correction term is negative and statistically significant implying convergence to a 
long-run equilibrium path. Since the fitted RER is found to be quite closer to the 
actual behavior exhibited by RER, the variables identified with certain lags could, 
therefore, serve as lead indicators of real exchange rate behaviour. On the basis of  2
results, it may be found that appreciation in RER should not always be seen as a 
decline in international competitiveness of the traded sector as one of the factor 
contributing to the RER appreciation is attributed to higher growth reflecting an 
improvement in competitiveness. 
 
The paper titled ‘Determinants of Overnight Index Swap (OIS) Rates: Some 
Empirical Findings from an Emerging Market Economy, India in the Special Notes 
Section is by Saurabh Ghosh and Amarendra Acharya. It uses the financial sector 
variables over the last two years to analyse the determinants of the Overnight Index 
Swap (OIS) rates in India. The paper finds that among the financial variables 
considered, in the short run, G-sec rate and call rate had positive and significant 
correlation with the OIS rate, while inflation rate was not contemporaneously related 
with the OIS rate. The other factor that significantly causes the OIS rate movement is 
the liquidity conditions in the Indian money market, measured by the difference 
between the call and repo rate. These factors remained crucial even during and in 
the aftermath of the global financial crisis. The impulse response functions indicated 
that the market was resilient to shocks. The long run equilibrium relationship 
between OIS, G-sec and call rates was confirmed by existence of at least one 
cointegrating vector. The coefficient of G-sec rate in the estimated cointegration was 
found to be positive and significant. However, the coefficient of call rate was found to 
be negative and low. It could indicate that a high (low) call rate today was expected 
to converge to the long term market expectation as indicated by the OIS rate. The 
error correction term, though negative, was not found to be statistically significant at 
the conventional levels. This could be because of low volume in the OIS market. 
  
The paper ‘International Outsourcing from India: A Study’ by Brijesh 
Pazhayathodi in Special Notes Section evaluates the nexus of international 
outsourcing from India. The paper finds that India has a revealed comparative 
advantage in exports of ITES-BPO services. It also explores the sources of India’s 
comparative advantage in this area. The authors state that rapid rise in world trade in 
services would provide a good opportunity to India to raise its share in world trade. 
However, IT infrastructure and general business environment are two areas where 
India clearly lags behind other competing countries in the outsourcing arena. Another 
important finding is that even though there is a lot of media attention on outsourcing 
sector in India and other developing countries, maximum surplus in services trade is 
actually generated by developed countries. Even though India maintains its lead 
status as a source country for a variety of IT related services, there are a number of 
emerging challenges like anti-outsourcing legislation and protectionism in Western 
countries, rise of competitor countries, etc. The paper cautions that to maintain its 
lead and capture new markets and areas for which Indian service industries should 
remain vigilant.
