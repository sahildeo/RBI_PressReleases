Ways and Means Advances to the Government of India  
for the Financial Year 2010-11 
It has been decided in consultation with the Government of India that the 
following arrangements will be in force for the financial year 2010-11. 
The limit for Ways and Means Advances (WMA) will be Rs.30,000 crore for 
the first half of the year (April to September) and Rs.10,000 crore for the second half 
of the year (October to March). When 75 per cent of the limit of WMA is utilised by 
the Government, the Reserve Bank may trigger fresh floatation of market loans. 
 
           The Reserve Bank would retain the flexibility to revise the limits at any time, in 
consultation with the Government of India, taking into consideration the prevailing 
circumstances. 
 
           The interest rate on WMA/overdraft will be as under: 
a) Ways and Means Advances:  Repo Rate 
b) Overdraft:  Two percent above the Repo Rate 
  
         The minimum balance required to be maintained by the Government of India 
with the Reserve Bank of India will not be less than Rs.100 crore on Fridays, on the 
date of closure of Government of India's financial year and on June 30, i.e., closure 
of the annual accounts of the Reserve Bank of India and not less than Rs.10 crore 
on other days. 
 
          As per the provisions of the Agreement dated March 26, 1997 between the 
Government of India and the Reserve Bank of India, overdrafts beyond ten 
consecutive working days will not be allowed.
