RBI Staff Study - 5/2010 
Measurement of Inflation in India: 
Issues and Associated Challenges for the Conduct of Monetary Policy 
 
The Reserve Bank of India today released a Staff Study titled ëMeasurement 
of Inflation in India, Issues and Associated Challenges for the Conduct of Monetary 
Policyí. The Staff Study is by G V Nadhanael and Sitikantha Pattanaik, staff in the 
Department of Economic Analysis and Policy. The views expressed in the article is 
those of the authors and do not reflect the views of the Reserve Bank of India. 
 
This study presents key issues relating to Indiaís inflation data in the current 
context; while also explaining how analyses relevant for the conduct of monetary 
policy could remain ambiguous if inflation data used in such analyses have serious 
limitations.  
 
In India, the statistical limitations of prices data have been receiving 
increasing attention in the policy debates. This is because of the large divergence 
between CPI and WPI inflation trends in the past, wide dispersion in inflation across 
commodity groups within WPI, weak representative nature of the price indices in 
relation to the size and structure of the economy and significant volatility in headline 
WPI inflation due to supply shocks.  
 
The study documents measurement issues in inflation and highlights the 
deficiencies in inflation data in both, advanced and developing countries. It also 
outlines the major initiatives being taken in India to address some of the deficiencies. 
The study analyses the impact of non-updation of the base year on inflation 
measurement, comparative movement of different inflation indicators and GDP 
deflator as well as the dispersion of inflation within the commodity basket. The 
suitability of other inflation indicators in relation to headline inflation (i.e., month-over-
month seasonally adjusted inflation and core inflation) for conduct of monetary policy 
has also been examined.  
 
Major observations and conclusions of the study are: 
 
ï Addressing measurement issues in inflation is extremely critical for the 
effective conduct of monetary policy, as limitations in prices data entail the 
risk of adding noise to economic analysis and econometric estimates. This 
could complicate policy making. 
 
ï Limitations of the data on prices could yield misleading empirical estimates 
generated from analyses of money demand, monetary policy transmission, 
policy reaction function, pass-through effects and the real effective  2
exchange rate. All these are important for the conduct of monetary and 
macro-economic policies. 
 
ï Recent initiatives on improving price statistics in India, especially in terms 
of generating data on CPI-Urban and CPI-Rural, and a representative CPI 
for the country as a whole over time, would address a major data gap in 
India. 
 
ï As the shares of significantly volatile items like fuel and metals in total 
transactions have increased over time, updation of the base year of WPI to 
a more recent period could result in a larger volatility in inflation during 
2008-10.  
 
ï Since the distribution of inflation across different commodities within WPI 
exhibits large changes during periods of supply shocks, understanding the 
variability within the commodity basket is critical for analysing the 
underlying price pressures and respond with appropriate policy action. 
 
ï In the Indian context, the alternative measures of inflation, such as, month-
over-month seasonally adjusted inflation and core inflation, do not exhibit 
the desirable properties for becoming the key reference indicators in 
monetary policy, as they are significantly volatile like the headline inflation.
