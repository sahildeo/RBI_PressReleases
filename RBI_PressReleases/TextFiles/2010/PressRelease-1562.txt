The Reserve Bank of India has imposed a monetary penalty of Rs.25.00 lakh 
(Rupees Twenty Five Lakh only) on The Bank of Rajasthan Ltd. in exercise of powers 
vested in it under the provisions of Section 47A(1)(b) of the Banking Regulation Act, 
1949. The penalty is levied for (i) violation of the Reserve Bank of India's directions 
issued under Section 35A of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 in the area of acquisition 
of immovable properties, (ii) deletion of records in the bank's IT systems, (iii) Non-

Bank of India came to the conclusion that the violation was substantiated and 
warranted imposition of penalty. Accordingly, it penalised the bank.
