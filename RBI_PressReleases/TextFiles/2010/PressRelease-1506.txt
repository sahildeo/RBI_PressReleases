RBI signs Note Purchase Agreement with the IMF 
 
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has entered into a Note Purchase Agreement with the 
International Monetary Fund (IMF) under which the RBI shall purchase from the IMF notes for 
an amount up to the equivalent of US $10 billion. This is a part of the international efforts to 
support the IMFís lending capacity following the decision of the G-20 in its London Summit to 
treble the resources available to the IMF to $ 750 billion. This agreement is a temporary bilateral 
arrangement for an initial period of one year, which may be extended by a period of upto two 
years. Permanent increases in the resources of IMF are expected to take place through an 
increase in quotas and standing borrowing arrangements which are currently under negotiation. 
With the signing of this agreement by the RBI with the IMF, India as member of the G-20 has 
fulfilled its commitments in this regard.
