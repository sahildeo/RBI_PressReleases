RBI withdraws Short-term Forex Loans facility for NBFCs and HFCs 
 
The Reserve Bank of India has withdrawn, with immediate effect, the facility of 
short-term foreign currency borrowings provided to Non-Banking Finance 
Companies-Non-Deposit Taking-Systemically Important (NBFC-ND-SI) and the 
Housing Finance Companies (HFCs). The decision has been taken after a review of 
the prevailing macroeconomic conditions and improvements in the domestic credit 
and liquidity conditions. 
 
The Reserve Bank had, as a temporary measure, allowed NBFCs-ND-SI on 
October 31, 2008 and Housing Finance Companies on November 17, 2008, to raise 
short-term foreign currency borrowings not exceeding 50 per cent of the Net Owned 
Funds (NOF) or USD 10 million, whichever was higher, for refinancing their short-
term liabilities. The facility was extended to these companies under the approval 
route, subject to certain terms and conditions.
