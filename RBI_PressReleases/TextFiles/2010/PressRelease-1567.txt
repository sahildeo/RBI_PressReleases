 Prof. John Brian Taylor, Stanford University, USA delivers the Eleventh L.K. Jha 
Memorial Lecture on ëLessons from the Financial Crisis for Monetary Policy in 
Emerging Marketsí  
 
 The Reserve Bank of India organized the Eleventh L.K. Jha Memorial Lecture on 
February 24, 2010 at the Y.B. Chavan Centre, Mumbai. The Lecture was delivered by 
Prof. John Brian Taylor, Mary and Robert Raymond Professor of Economics at Stanford 
University on ëLessons from the Financial Crisis for Monetary Policy in Emerging 
Marketsí.  
 Governor Dr. D. Subbarao, in his welcome address at the lecture introduced the 
speaker to the audience. He briefly touched up on the impact of global financial crisis 
on the emerging market economies and called up on Prof. Taylor to deliver the lecture.  
Prof. Taylor provided an analysis of the global financial crisis and drew policy 
conclusions. Prof. Taylor was of the view that this financial crisis was triggered by 
monetary policy being too loose for too long in many advanced countries, particularly in 
the US. Prof. Taylor attributed the resilience of emerging market economies to good 
policies.  
Following is the brief abstract of the lecture:  
ï The lecture discussed three separate questions: what started it, what prolonged 
it and what made it so severe during the fall of 2008. The initial flare-up of the 
crisis occurred during the summer of 2007, it went on for more than a year and 
the culmination was the incredible panic that hit in September and October of 
2008. For each question, it was found that certain government actions and 
interventions came to the top of the list of what went wrong.  
ï The crisis was precipitated by monetary excesses. These excesses took the 
form of interest rates that were held too low for too long by the Federal Reserve 
and some other central banks. The low interest rates led to a housing boom 
which eventually ended in a bust and was a significant factor in the crisis. The 
low interest rates also were a probable factor in excessive risk-taking as people 
searched for higher yields. Between 2003 and 2005 the interest rate was held 
usually low compared to the Taylor rule, and at levels that we had not seen since 
the turbulent 1970s. Prof. Taylor stated that there was a growing agreement that 
an excessively easy monetary policy was a key factor leading to the boom and 
thus to the bust and the crisis. 
ï The housing bust had impact on the financial markets as falling house prices led 
to delinquencies and foreclosures. It is important to note that the excessive risk 
taking and the low interest rate monetary policy decisions are connected. 
Delinquency rates and foreclosure rates are inversely related to housing price 
inflation during this period. During the years of the rapidly rising housing prices, 
delinquency and foreclosure rates declined rapidly. The benefits of holding onto  2
a house, perhaps working longer hours to make the payments, are higher when 
price of the house is rising rapidly. When prices are falling, the incentives to do 
so are much less and turn negative if the price of the house falls below the value 
of the mortgage. Hence, delinquencies and foreclosures rose.  
ï Interest rate spreads between three month LIBOR and the overnight federal 
funds rate jumped to unprecedented levels in August 2007 and remained high 
for over a year. Bringing the interest rate spread down, therefore, became a 
major objective of policy, as well as a measure of its success in dealing with the 
market turmoil. According to Prof. Taylor, the flare-up was caused by 
counterparty risk in the banking system due to defaults and expected defaults of 
securities on the bankís balance sheets and not due to a shortage of liquidity. 
The policy makers misdiagnosed the problem, treating it as a shortage of 
liquidity rather than an increase in risk.  
ï According to Prof. Taylor, the sharp cuts in Fed rates in the winter of 2007-08 
were overdone in terms of Taylor rule. The result was some rapid dollar 
depreciation, and oil prices went up sharply, helping bring on the recession. 
Thus, the governmentís initial reaction exacerbated the problem. According to 
Prof. Taylor, the fiscal policy though provided additional income to individuals 
and families in the United States; it did not result in jump start consumption and 
the economy. This has been attributed to the permanent income theory of 
consumption in terms of which people spend little of the temporary infusion of 
cash.  
ï Understanding the events surrounding the Lehman bankruptcy is particularly 
important for assessing what went wrong. Many in government now argue that 
the cause of the panic in the fall of 2008 was the failure of the government to 
intervene and prevent the bankruptcy of Lehman. However, the problem was not 
the failure to bail out Lehman Brothers but rather the failure of the government to 
articulate a clear predictable strategy for lending and intervening into a financial 
sector.  
ï The big surprise, however, was the amazing resiliency of the emerging market 
countries including India in the face of shocks associated with the financial crisis. 
The contrast with the 1990s, when emerging markets were suffering their own 
crises, was stark. The most important reason is that they had moved toward 
better macroeconomic policies in the 1990s and they stuck to those policies 
during the crisis. According to Prof. Taylor, the emerging market countries were 
careful not to borrow in foreign countries, and here Indian regulatory policy 
deserves special credit in discouraging such borrowing by Indian banks. They 
built up their foreign reserves so they could intervene in the case of a big shock 
like they received. They kept inflation relatively low and were more careful with 
public sector deficits.  
ï According to Prof. Taylor, throughout this period there were market problems of 
various sorts. Mortgages were originated without sufficient documentation or with 
overly optimistic underwriting assumptions, and then sold off in complex 
derivative securities which credit rating agencies rated too highly, certainly in 
retrospect. Individuals and institutions took highly risky positions either through a 
lack of diversification or excessive leverage ratios.  
Prof. Taylor mentioned that for policy makers it is important to reinstate or 
establish a set of principles to follow to prevent misguided actions and interventions in 
the future. The following major policy measures have been proposed:   3
ï Emphasis should be on proposals to reduce the likelihood of government 
interventions and actions that led to the crisis. Going forward this means dealing 
with the very large budget deficits and rising government debt; scaling back or at 
least not adding more Keynesian stimulus packages; exiting as fast as possible 
from the extraordinary monetary policy actions which have questioned central 
bank credibility and threatened their independence; and ending the bailout 
mentality that will take governments further into the operations of private 
businesses.  
 
ï Reform of financial regulation is clearly in order. Based on recent experience, 
closing present and future regulatory gaps and de-conflicting overlapping and 
ambiguous responsibilities would help reduce risk, especially as new instruments 
and institutions evolve. Examining new instruments, looking for new risks and 
gaps, and making recommendations for changes in regulations by using the 
ideas from conferences like this one would also help.  
 
ï For the most part, the policy implications of the crisis are that those central 
banks that deviated from good policy should get back to what they were doing 
before the crisis. They need to earn back credibility and preserve their 
independence. Systematic monetary policies focusing on a credible goal for 
inflation worked well in the past and they will work well in the future. For central 
banks that were following sounder policiesóand here credit should be given to 
the progress made in India and other emerging market central banksóthey 
should continue to do so. 
 
ï The crisis does reveal some potential new fault lines, largely related to the 
increased globalization and international connection between financial markets, 
which was so evident during the panic. The central banks will have to learn to 
cope with the shock originated in the developed countries.  
Dr. Subir Gokarn, Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India highlighted the main 
messages of Prof. Taylorís lecture and offered a vote of thanks.
