RBI announces rate of interest on FRBs 2017 
 
The rate of interest on the Floating Rate Bonds, 2017 (FRB, 2017) applicable 
for the half-year (January 2, 2010 to July 1, 2010) shall be 4.90 per cent per annum. 
 
It may be recalled that the rate of interest on the FRB, 2017 was set at a 
mark-up (as decided in the auction held on July 1, 2002) over and above the variable 
base rate. The variable base rate for payment of interest shall be the average rate 
(rounded off up to two decimal places) of the implicit yields at cut-off prices of the 
last six auctions of Government of India 364-day Treasury Bills held up to the 
commencement of the respective half yearly coupon period which worked out to be 
4.56 per cent. The mark-up decided in the auction held on July 1, 2002 was (+) 0.34 
per cent (plus 34 basis points). The coupon rate has thus been fixed at 4.90 per 
cent.
