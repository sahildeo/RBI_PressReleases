RBI Bulletin ñ July 2010 
The July issue of the Reserve Bank of India Bulletin includes four articles.  
Foreign Trade: April 2010  This article reviews Indiaís merchandise trade 
performance during April 2010 on the basis of data released by the Ministry of 
Commerce and Industry and Directorate General of Commercial Intelligence and 
Statistics (DGCI&S). The article also covers disaggregated commodity-wise and 
direction-wise analysis of Indiaís trade during the period April-November 2009. 
Main Findings 
The article observes that during April 2010, Indiaís merchandise exports at US$ 
16.9 billion posted a growth of 36.2 per cent over the corresponding month of previous 
year as against a decline of 32.8 per cent during April 2009. Merchandise imports at 
US$ 27.3 billion recorded a growth of 43.3 per cent over the corresponding month of 
previous year as against a decline of 37.2 per cent during April 2009. The oil and non-
oil imports of India also registered a growth of 70.5 per cent and 34.3 per cent in April 
2010, respectively, as against a decline of 46.9 per cent and 33.1 per cent in April 
2009. Further, the disaggregated data on commodity-wise merchandise trade as well 
as source and direction of exports and imports reveal that trade of all major commodity 
groups (viz., primary products, manufactured goods, petroleum products and bulk and 
non bulk import items) and with major trading partners (viz., OECD, OPEC, Eastern 
Europe and Developing Countries) registered a decline during April-November 2009 
over the corresponding period of previous year.  
Indian Investment Abroad in Joint Ventures and Wholly Owned 
Subsidiaries: 2009-10 (April-March) reviews Indiaís outward foreign direct investment 
(FDI) in joint ventures (JVs) and wholly owned subsidiaries (WOSs) during the quarter 
January-March 2010 and during 2009-10 (April-March). 
Main Findings 
The article observes that during the quarter under review, Indiaís outward 
investment stood at US$ 1.9 billion, showing a decline of 52.7 per cent over the 
corresponding quarter of the previous year. During the quarter under review, there was 
an increase in outflows financed through loans while outflows financed through equity 
experienced a sharp decline. During 2009-10, the actual outward FDI in JVs and WOSs 
stood at US$ 10.3 billion, which was 36.5 per cent lower than the investment made 
during the previous year. During 2009-10, the investment financed through loans 
registered a growth over the previous year whereas the investment financed through 
equity declined sharply. 
Activity-wise, manufacturing sector occupied the largest share in Indiaís outward 
investment during last quarter of 2009-10 and during 2009-10 as a whole. However, the 
share of manufacturing declined during 2009-10 in comparison to previous year. 
Direction-wise, a larger part of Indiaís outward investment was made in Mauritius during  2
January-March 2010. On a yearly basis, Singapore was the largest FDI recipient in 
2009-10, accounting for 35.5 per cent of Indiaís total outward FDI, moreover, its share 
increased over the year. 
India's External Debt as at end-March 2010 reviews Indiaís external debt 
during the full year 2009-10 (April-March). 
Main Findings 
The article on Indiaís External Debt places Indiaís external debt, as at end-March 
2010, at US$ 261.4 billion or 18.9 per cent of GDP. The long-term debt at US$ 209.0 
billion and short-term debt at US$ 52.4 billion accounted for 79.9 per cent and 20.1 per 
cent, respectively, of the total external debt. The article also provides tables and charts 
on various details on external debt like External Debt Outstanding, External Debt by 
Component, Currency Composition, Instrument-wise classification, Short-Term Debt by 
Original Maturity and Residual Maturity etc. A detailed account of external debt as 
compiled in the standard format as at end-March 2010 in Rupee and US Dollar terms 
and revised data for the earlier quarters are provided in Statement 1 and 2, 
respectively. 
Developments in India's Balance of Payments during the Fourth Quarter 
(January-March 2010) of 2009-10 and full Year 2009-10 reviews Indiaís Balance of 
Payments (BoP) for the quarter January-March 2010 and also for the full year 2009-10 
(April-March) 
Main Findings 
The higher trade deficit combined with the lower invisibles surplus widened the 
current account deficit during Q4 of 2009-10. After four consecutive quarters of decline, 
on a year-on-year basis, services receipts recorded a growth of 13.4 per cent led by 
software and financial services. Private transfer receipts continued to be robust during 
Q4 of 2009-10. The overall balance was in surplus at US$ 2.1 billion, which resulted in 
a net accretion to foreign exchange reserves of equivalent amount.  
During 2009-10, despite a lower trade deficit on BoP basis, decline in invisibles 
surplus led to higher current account deficit at US$ 38.4 billion (2.9 per cent of GDP) 
during 2009-10, as compared with US$ 28.7 billion (2.4 per cent of GDP) during 2008-
09. The surplus in the capital account increased sharply to US$ 53.6 billion (4.1 per 
cent of GDP) during the year from US$ 7.3 billion (0.6 per cent of GDP) a year ago. As 
the surplus in the capital account exceeded the current account deficit, there was a net 
accretion to foreign exchange reserves of US$ 13.4 billion during 2009-10 on BoP basis 
i.e. excluding valuation effects (as against a drawdown of reserves of US$ 20.1 billion 
during 2008-09). The article provides details with tables and charts on key components 
of invisibles, movements in current account balance, capital flows as well as variation in 
reserves. Statement-I presents preliminary data for Q4 and partially revised data for the 
earlier quarters of 2009-10, based on which BoP data for the full year 2009-10 have 
been compiled.
