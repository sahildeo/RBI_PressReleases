De-sequestering of MSS Balances 
 
On a review of its cash position, the Government of India, in consultation with 
the Reserve Bank of India, decided to transfer an amount of Rs.5,000 crore from the 
MSS cash account to the normal cash account of the Government of India on March 
11, 2010. An equivalent amount of Government securities would accordingly form 
part of the normal borrowing of the Government of India for the fiscal year 2009-10. 
 
It may be recalled that following the amendment to the Memorandum of 
Understanding on the Market Stabilisation Scheme (MSS) on February 26 2009, it 
was decided to transfer in installments an amount of Rs.45,000 crore from the MSS 
cash account to the normal cash account of the Government of India by March 31, 
2009.  Subsequently, Rs.12,000 crore of  MSS balances was de-sequestered on 
March 4, 2009.  It was then decided that Rs.33,000 crore of MSS balances would be 
de-sequestered against the approved market borrowing programme or bought back 
in the fiscal year 2009-10. On a review of the cash position of the Government, an 
amount of Rs.28,000 crore of MSS balances was de-sequestered on May 2, 2009.  
 
The MSS outstanding as on March 11, 2010 is Rs. 2,737 crore (Face Value).
