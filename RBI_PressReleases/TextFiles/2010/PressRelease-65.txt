Meeting with Bankers on Credit to Micro Finance Institutions (MFIs) 
 
The Reserve Bank of India today met select banks and SIDBI to get an 
assessment regarding the ground level situation in the microfinance sector in Andhra 
Pradesh and other states and the need for any interim measures. 
 
Banks informed that collections by MFIs in Andhra Pradesh have deteriorated 
considerably and there were some incipient signs of the contagion spreading to other 
states. As far as at the banksí exposures to MFIs were concerned, the MFIs had so 
far been able to meet their repayment obligations to the banks till November 2010. 
However, going forward this may be a matter of concern.  The general view of the 
banks was that while the structural issues regarding the MFI sector may be 
addressed by the Malegam Committee, some interim measures may be required to 
address the gap between the recoveries by MFIs and their payment commitments to 
banks. The banks stressed on the need to work out an interim arrangement 
involving, inter alia,  rescheduling of exposures to MFIs subject to certain covenants 
such as MFIs agreeing to reduce their leverage and growth projections. Bankers 
requested Reserve Bank to consider some regulatory concessions to enable them to 
reschedule the exposure to MFIs. 
 
The RBI sensitized the banks to the need to maintain funding lines to MFIs on 
merits to prevent contagion.  The Indian Banks Association will shortly come up with 
concrete proposals for the measures to be taken in the interim, for consideration of 
Reserve Bank of India.
