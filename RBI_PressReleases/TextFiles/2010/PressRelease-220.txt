RBI releases Report of the Working Group on BoP Manual for India 
   
The Reserve Bank of India, today released the report of the Working Group 
on Indiaís balance of payments statistics and the revised BoP manual for India. 
 
The Report has two parts. Part I discusses various issues relating to India's 
Balance of Payments statistics and makes a number of suggestions to improve 
compilation, coverage and presentation of Indiaís balance of payments consistent 
with international best practices. Part II presents the revised Balance of Payments 
Manual for India. 
 
Key Recommendations 
 
Goods 
 
ï Buying and selling of goods that do not cross national boundaries and do not 
undergo significant transformation have to be recorded as goods under 
ìmerchantingî. Repairs on goods, which have hitherto been recorded under 
goods, need to be included in services and renamed as ìmaintenance and repair 
services not included elsewhere.î 
 
ï A new purpose code for manufacturing services on physical inputs owned by 
others may be introduced to give a separate treatment to "goods for processing". 
 
ï The data on imports should be presented on free on board (FOB) basis. 
Necessary information may be gathered from the Daily Trade Returns (DTRs) or 
through a survey. 
 
ï Re-exports may be presented as a supplementary item under exports and 
therefore, an additional code for re-export may be introduced at the Customsí 
end. 
 
ï In view of the persistence of differences in the import figures between the 
Reserve Bank and Directorate General of Commercial Intelligence and Statistics 
(DGCI&S), a reconciliation exercise, on a quarterly basis, between the Reserve 
Bank and the DGCI&S be initiated. 
 
Services 
 
ï Transportation services should be classified by route (sea, air and others) and by 
component (passenger, freight and others). 
  
ï Regarding disaggregated information on health and education related services, 
new purpose codes should be introduced under Foreign Exchange Transactions 
Electronic Reporting System (FETERS) and the Department of Commerce, 
Government of India should also follow up with the respective ministries to collect 
the relevant information. 
    2
ï A switch over to banking channel data reported through FETERS be adopted to 
compile details on software services and use the industry sources (i.e., 
NASSCOM data) for validation purposes only. 
  
ï New purpose codes to be introduced to capture various services viz., receipts for 
the cost of construction of projects executed by Indian companies abroad, 
pension and standardised guarantee services, ìmanufacturing services on 
physical inputs owned by othersî and ìmaintenance and repair services n.i.eî as 
well as ìmerchanting servicesî. 
  
ï To capture details on financial services related to derivatives in India's BoP, a 
separate committee needs to be set up. 
 
ï Invisibles article containing disaggregated information on services be published 
on a quarterly basis and possibility of releasing monthly aggregate data on trade 
in services be explored. 
 
ï A standing committee with officers from relevant departments of the Reserve 
Bank, Department of Commerce, DGCI&S, NASSCOM, Software Technology 
Parks of India (STPI) and other relevant ministries/departments, be constituted to 
look into various medium and long-term issues relating to collection of data on 
trade in services and to examine data requirements for bilateral and multilateral 
trade negotiations. The committee may also explore the possibility of capturing 
details of ìForeign Affiliates Statisticsî (FATS) and Mode 3 transactions 
(commercial presence which represent domestic operations of foreign affiliates 
including the subsidiaries of subsidiaries). 
  
Income and Transfers 
 
ï Income and transfers be appropriately classified under the heads of primary 
income and secondary income as per the international best practices. 
   
Capital Account 
 
ï Capital account in India's current standard presentation of BoP should be 
bifurcated and presented separately as ìcapital accountî and ìfinancial accountî. 
Accordingly, ìcapital transfersî and ìnon-produced and non-financial assetsî, are 
to be excluded from the current account of Indiaís balance of payments, and 
included explicitly in the rechristened ìcapital accountî. 
 
ï An internal Group be set up to address the issue of definition and coverage of 
foreign direct investment. 
 
Scheme of Implementation 
 
ï The BoP data should be presented in the new format and work to be initiated 
immediately to gather additional information as recommended in the Report. 
 
ï The IMF expects its member countries to implement the BPM6 standards by 
2012. The Group is hopeful of meeting the time line. 
 
BoP Manual 
 
The Manual, presented in Part II of the Report discusses the conceptual and 
methodological issues pertaining to BoP. It has also made a detailed assessment of 
the current practices of compilation, data sources and presentation of BoP in India 
against the backdrop of the significant changes introduced by the IMFís latest 
Manual (BPM6). The Manual incorporates a revised format for standard presentation 
of BoP in India, in conformity with international best practices.  3
 
Background 
 
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has been compiling and publishing Balance 
of Payments (BoP) data for India since 1948. It brought out Indiaís Balance of 
Payments Compilation Manual was brought out for the first time in 1987 to put 
together methodological changes and provide information on concepts, constituents 
and sources of data used.. The manual was in line with the Fourth Edition of the 
Balance of Payments Manual (BPM4, 1977) of the International Monetary Fund 
(IMF). Subsequently, the IMF released the Fifth Edition of the Balance of Payments 
Manual (BPM5, 1993), which sets out detailed revised accounting procedure to 
synchronise external accounts with the System of National Accounts. Several 
changes and improvements in the compilation and presentations of Indiaís BoP have 
also been introduced over the years. However, there was no explicit and 
comprehensive record of these available in one place. In the meantime, IMF 
published the Sixth Edition of the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM6, 2009) to take 
into account, among other things, the developments in globalisation impacting cross-
border transactions and issued guidelines to capture them appropriately in BoP 
statistics. 
  
Against this backdrop, the Reserve Bank constituted a Working Group 
(Chairman: Shri Deepak Mohanty) to examine the current practices, procedures of 
compilation, presentation, coverage and sources of Indiaís Balance of Payments 
(BoP) statistics in relation to international best practices and to bring out a 
comprehensive Balance of Payments Manual for India. The Group submitted its 
Report to Deputy Governor, Dr. Subir Gokarn on October 13, 2010.
