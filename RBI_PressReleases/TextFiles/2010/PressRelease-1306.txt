RBI Guidelines to SCs/RCs for change in take over of the  
Management of the Borrower's under the SARFAESI Act, 2002 
 
 
The Reserve Bank of India has today released the final guidelines to enable 
securitisation companies (SCs) and reconstruction companies (RCs) to change or 
takeover the management of the business of the borrower in order to realise their 
dues.  
 
The guidelines have been framed under Section 9 (a) of the Securitisation and 
Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 
(SARFAESI) Act.   
 
The objective of these guidelines is to ensure fairness, transparency, non-
discrimination and non-arbitrariness in the action of securitisation companies/ 
reconstruction companies and to build in a system of checks and balances while 
effecting change in or take over of the management of the business of the borrower by 
SCs/RCs. 
 
The guidelines lay down the eligibility conditions and grounds based on which 
SCs/RCs may exercise powers to effect change in or take over the management of 
the business of the borrower for realising their dues.   SCs/RCs should frame policy 
guidelines in this matter with the approval of their Board of Directors.  
 
The guidelines also provide for setting up of an Independent Advisory 
Committee (IAC) to evaluate the proposals of the SCs/RCs, giving compulsory notice 
of 60 days to the borrower indicating the intention of the SC/RC of effecting change in 
or taking over the management of his business, giving opportunity to the borrowers to 
file objections, if any, examining borrowers' objections by IAC/Board of the SC/RC 
before a reasoned order is passed by the SC/RC. 
 
 It may be recalled that the draft guidelines were placed on the RBI's website 
on December 5, 2009.  The guidelines have been finalised after taking into account 
the comments received from various stakeholders including banks, financial 
institutions, non-banking finance companies, securitisation companies/reconstruction 
companies, chambers of commerce and members of the public.
