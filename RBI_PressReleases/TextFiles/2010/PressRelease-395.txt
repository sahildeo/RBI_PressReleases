RBI Sub-Committee to study Issues and Concerns in MFI Sector 
There have been some concerns expressed in the media about high interest 
rates, coercive recovery processes and multiple lending practised by some 
microfinance institutions. The State of Andhra Pradesh has recently issued an 
ordinance making registration of microfinance institutions (MFIs) with the State 
governments compulsory.   
In order to study these and other related issues and implications for its 
policies and given the useful role played by the microfinance institutions in providing 
access to financial services to the poor and excluded, the Reserve Bank of India has 
set up a Sub-Committee of the Central Board of Directors of the Reserve Bank to 
study the issues and concerns in this sector, including ways and means of making 
interest rates charged by them reasonable. Shri Y H Malegam, a senior member on 
the Central Board of Directors of the Reserve Bank of India will chair the Sub-
Committee.  The Sub-Committee will submit its report in three months.  
The Reserve Bank of India regulates only those microfinance institutions 
which are registered with it as non-banking finance companies. Although the 
registered companies cover over 80 per cent of the microfinance business, in terms 
of number of companies they constitute a small percentage of the total number of 
MFIs in the country.  The Reserve Bank, however, does not prescribe lending rates 
for these institutions.
