governance. Regarding the specific proposal for constitution of the Financial Stability and 
Development Council, he assured the Board that this will not undermine the independence 
of regulators. 
 
Spelling out the key lessons of the crisis, he stressed on the need for proactive 
domestic oversight and regulation of financial markets and addressing transmission 
channels of contagion. While appreciating the need for calibrated approach to capital 
account convertibility and stating that financial innovation should serve the objective of real
