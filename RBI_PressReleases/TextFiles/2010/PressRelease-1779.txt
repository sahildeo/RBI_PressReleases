Reserve Bank Cancels the Licence of  
Shree Sinnar Vyapari Sahakari Bank Ltd., Sinnar (Maharashtra) 
In view of the fact that Shree Sinnar Vyapari Sahakari Bank Ltd., Sinnar 
(Maharashtra), had ceased to be solvent, all efforts to revive it in close consultation 
with the Government of Maharashtra had failed and the depositors were being 
inconvenienced by continued uncertainty, the Reserve Bank of India delivered the 
order cancelling its licence to the bank after the close of business on December 31,  
2009. The Registrar of Co-operative Societies, Maharashtra State has also been 
requested to issue an order for winding up the bank and appoint a liquidator for the 
bank. It may be highlighted that on liquidation, every depositor is entitled to 
repayment of his / her deposits up to a monetary ceiling of Rs. 1,00,000/- (Rupees 
one lakh only) from the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation 
(DICGC) under usual terms and conditions. 
 The bank was granted a licence by Reserve Bank on October 14,1987 to 
commence banking business. The statutory inspection of the bank with reference to 
its position as on March 31,2008 had indicated that its financial position was 
impaired and it was issued directions under Section 35 A of the Banking Regulation 
Act, 1949 (As applicable to Co-operative Societies) from the close of business of 
May 12,2009 restricting its operations.  
The Reserve Bank of India issued a show cause notice to the bank on 
September 10, 2009, asking it to show cause as to why the licence granted to it to 
conduct banking business should not be cancelled. The reply to the show cause 
notice was examined.  The bank did not have a viable plan of action for its revival. In 
the absence of any viable proposal to turn around and achieve the required 
regulatory prescriptions the possibility of revival of the bank was remote. Therefore, 
the Reserve Bank of India took the extreme measure of cancelling licence of the 
bank in the interest of the bank's depositors. With the cancellation of its licence and 
commencement of liquidation proceedings, the process of paying the depositors of 
Shree Sinnar Vyapari Sahakari Bank Ltd., Sinnar , Nashik.  (Maharashtra) will be set 
in motion subject to the terms and conditions of the Deposit Insurance Scheme.   
 Consequent to the cancellation of its licence, Shree Sinnar Vyapari Sahakari 
Bank Ltd., Sinnar , Nashik. is   prohibited from carrying on ëbanking businessí as 
defined in Section 5(b) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (AACS) including 
acceptance and repayment of deposits.

General Manager, Urban Banks Department, Mumbai Regional office, Reserve Bank 
of India,.Garment House , Worli, Mumbai -400018.  His contact details are as under
