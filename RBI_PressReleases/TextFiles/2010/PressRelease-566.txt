Background   2
In recent years, the operating procedure of monetary policy  has witnessed 
significant changes with the development of the money market and changes in 
liquidity conditions.  In the process, the Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF), 
introduced in June 2000, has emerged as the principal operating instrument for 
modulating short-term liquidity. Consequently, the repo and the reverse repo rates 
have become the key instruments for signalling the monetary policy stance. These 
instruments, along with others, such as, the cash reserve ratio (CRR), open market 
operations (OMO) and market stabilisation scheme (MSS), have served the Indian 
monetary and financial system well. However, Indiaís increasing integration with the 
global economy, large volatility in capital flows and sharp fluctuations in government 
cash balances have posed several challenges to liquidity management by the 
Reserve Bank, particularly in effectively signalling the monetary policy stance. 
 
Against this backdrop, there was a need to revisit the framework of the 
operating procedure of monetary policy  As announced in the first Quarter Review of 
Monetary Policy for 2010-11, therefore, the Reserve Bank has now constituted the 
working group to review the framework of the  operating procedure of monetary 
policy.
