RBI issues Revised Guidelines on Uniform Accounting for Repo/Reverse Repo 
Transactions 
The Reserve Bank of India had today issued revised guidelines on Uniform 
Accounting for Repo/Reverse Repo Transactions.  The guidelines replace the 
guidelines issued in March 2003 which treated 'repo' as a combination of two 
independent sale/purchase transactions as per the legal provisions prevailing then. The 
accounting norms now propose to capture the economic essence of 'repo' as a 
collateralised lending/ borrowing transaction that is structured as a legal sale / purchase 
of securities as recognised by the RBI (Amendment) Act, 2006. The revision in the 
accounting norms would bring such transactions on to the balance sheet of the repo 
participants in its true economic sense, thus enhancing transparency.  
The salient features of the revised guidelines are: 
ï The revised accounting guidelines will apply to market repo transactions in 
government securities and corporate debt securities.  These accounting norms 
would, however, not apply to repo / reverse repo transactions conducted under the 
Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) with the RBI. 
ï The securities sold under repo would continue to be reflected in the investment 
account of the repo seller and would be subject to the usual mark to market 
valuation discipline. Accordingly, the repo buyer would not reflect the securities 
acquired under repo in his investment account.  
ï The movement of securities should be accounted for in the books of the 
counterparties by showing it as contra entries for the sake of greater transparency. 
ï The regulatory treatment of market repo transactions in government securities will 
continue as hitherto, i.e., the funds borrowed under market repo will continue to be 
exempt from CRR/SLR computation and the security acquired under market 
reverse repo shall continue to be eligible for SLR.  The applicability of the 
CRR/SLR norms for repo transactions in corporate bonds will, however, be as per 
the guidelines issued vide IDMD.DOD.05/11.08.38/2009-10 dated January 8, 2010.  
 
The revised accounting guidelines for market repo will be effective from April 01, 2010.
