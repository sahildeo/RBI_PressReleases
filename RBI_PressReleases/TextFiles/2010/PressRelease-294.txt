RBI re-introduces Liquidity Easing Measures 
 
In the Second Quarter Review of Monetary Policy, 2010-11 announced last 
week, the Reserve Bank of India had stated that ìeven though a liquidity deficit is 
consistent with an anti-inflation stance, excessive deficit in liquidity can be disruptive 
both to financial markets and to credit growth in the banking system. To ensure that 
economic activity is not disrupted by liquidity constraints, the liquidity deficit needs to 
be contained within a reasonable limit.î  
 
In the recent period, the Reserve Bank has taken a number of steps, including 
open market operations (OMO) to alleviate liquidity pressure.  Even then liquidity 
pressure continues reflecting Governmentís cash balances and other frictional 
liquidity demand.  For example, liquidity injected by the Reserve Bank through its 
liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) window on an average was about ` 1,13,000 crore 
during November 8-9, 2010.  Accordingly, in line with the stance of monetary policy 
set out in the Second Quarter Review of November 2, 2010 and in order to provide 
liquidity comfort arising out of frictional liquidity pressure, it has been decided to re-
introduce the following temporary measures with immediate effect : 
 
ï A special second LAF (SLAF) will be conducted on a daily basis at 4.15 p.m. 
up to December 16, 2010. 
 
ï Scheduled commercial banks may avail of additional liquidity support under 
the LAF to the extent of up to 1.0 per cent of their net demand and time 
liabilities (NDTL) as on the reporting Friday of the second preceding fortnight.  
For any shortfall in maintenance of statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) during 
November 9 ñ December 16, 2010 arising out of availment of this facility, 
banks may seek waiver of penal interest purely as an ad hoc, temporary 
measure. 
 
The above measures are purely ad hoc, temporary and will be in force till 
December 16, 2010.
