"As we pursue our objective of achieving rapid and inclusive growth, our 
monetory and financial policies must be guided by three objectives. First, they must 
ensure that inflation is kept under control since it hurts the common man the most and 
also distorts economic signals.  Second, they must ensure stability of the banking and 
financial sector since otherwise we run the risk of experiencing financial crises which 
always impose high cost. Third, they must meet the financial intermediation needs of 
rapid and inclusive growth." This was the key message of the Chief Guest Hon’ble 
Prime Minister of India Dr. Manmohan Singh at the Platinum Jubilee finale function of 
the Reserve Bank of India, held at the National Centre for the Performing Arts, 
Mumbai on April 1, 2010.  Complimenting the Reserve Bank for serving our country 
with great distinction in its 75 years of existence, the Prime Minister said that the Bank 
has already shown commendable flexibility in allowing the system of banking agents 
to develop. It must remain committed to further expansion of banking services so that 
banks can touch the lives of more and more of our people, he said.  
Shri Pranab Mukherjee, Hon’ble Finance Minister of India,                   
Shri K. Sankaranarayanan, His Excellency Governor of Maharashtra and                 
Shri Ashok Chavan, Hon’ble Chief Minister of Maharashtra were the Guests of 
Honour. Former Governor and senior Executives of the Reserve Bank, banks and 
financial institutions, senior government officials, leading industrialists and other 
glitterati from the world of finance graced the occasion. Senior officials of the Reserve 
Bank were also present.  
Established on April 1, 1935, the Reserve Bank of India, country’s central bank, 
celebrated 2009-2010 as its Platinum Jubilee year. The year-long celebrations 
included several events with a series of learning events to showcase the Reserve 
Bank as a knowledge institution, a set of internal events involving current and former 
RBI staff to reinforce a sense of belonging and inclusiveness among members of the 
RBI family and the outreach programme. The focus of the outreach programme was 
financial inclusion and financial literacy. The top management of the Reserve Bank 
travelled to remote villages across the country to listen to ordinary people, see and 
understand how grassroot institutions operate and to learn of the challenges and 
opportunities for financial inclusion.  
Speaking at the platinum jubilee finale function, the Prime Minister termed his 
coming to Mumbai and the Reserve Bank as homecoming of sorts and recalled his 
days at the Reserve Bank as being extremely happy and warm. Dr. Man Mohan Singh 
was the Governor of the Reserve Bank between 1982 and1985. 
Briefly narrating how the Reserve Bank had occupied a pivotal place in the 
economy of India throughout the 75 years, he appreciated the way it had responded to  2
new challenges and dilemmas and given a renewed thrust to deepening and ensuring 
stability in the financial markets. While the Indian banks or financial markets had not 
been affected directly by the recent meltdown, the crisis had drawn attention to the 
need to strengthen India’s financial system in a variety of ways, he stated and added 
that “on the one hand, we need to ensure that the financial system provides the 
finance needed for our development, especially for infrastructure development, on the 
other, we also need to develop long-term debt markets and to deepen corporate bond 
markets.” He further stressed the need for improving futures markets for better price 
discovery and regulation as also remove institutional hurdles to facilitate better 
intermediation.  
Shri Pranab Mukherjee, Hon’ble Finance Minster of India in his speech paid 
tribute to the institution by saying that the Reserve Bank of India’s story, in a sense, 
had been that of reorienting its policies and strengthening its roles to successfully 
cope with new challenges through these eventful years. The Reserve Bank’s policy 
responses and programmes in these recent years had indeed contributed significantly 
to improving the efficiency in the process of financial intermediation in India, 
enhancing the effectiveness in the conduct of monetary policy and creating conditions 
for integration of India’s domestic financial sector with the global system.  
The Finance Minister mentioned that the Reserve Bank’s role in maintaining a 
level of confidence in India’s financial system among all the participants and 
stakeholders, absence of excessive volatility that could have unduly and adversely 
affected real economic activity and in ensuring uninterrupted financial transactions in 
those trying times had been truly laudable and exemplary. He hoped that as a multi-
tasking agency, the Reserve Bank would continue to play a significant role in our 
macroeconomic policy making and develop and display, as it always has, dynamism 
and flexibility in responding to the challenges faced from time to time. 
Earlier, in his remarks Dr. D Subbarao, Governor, Reserve Bank of India briefly 
traced the history of central banking and the Reserve Bank and said that platinum 
jubilee was a chronological milestone, an occasion for celebration in any organisation; 
but it was also an occasion for introspection. He highlighted four areas that the 
Reserve Bank must address going forward. The first area to focus upon, according to 
the Reserve Bank Governor, was to learn to manage both economic and regulatory 
policies in a globalising environment.  
The Reserve Bank also needed to reposition itself as a knowledge institution. 
“The idea is not to fight globalisation but to manage it to the country’s best 
advantage,” he said and added that “we need to learn from the best in the world, but 
adapt that to the demands and culture of a maturing and emerging economy. Being 
not only at the frontiers of domain knowledge, but oftentimes reinventing it, but all the 
time remaining sensitive to the core concerns of an emerging market economy.”  
The third big challenge for the Reserve Bank was to further and deepen 
financial inclusion. Elaborating on this, Dr. Subbarao said that “we all know from 
personal experience that economic opportunity is strongly inter-twined with financial 
access. Such access is especially powerful for the poor as it provides them 
opportunities to build savings, make investments, avail credit, and above all insure 
themselves against income shocks.” Financial inclusion was the next big idea, as it 
would at once promote both, growth and equity.  
The final challenge for the Reserve Bank was to become a more transparent 
and sensitive institution. “We are a public institution and have an obligation to deliver 
quality service at the cutting edge level. We need to listen to people, be sensitive to 
their concerns and redress their grievances. We also need to communicate effectively 
and credibly and explain the logic of our decisions and actions at both technical and 
non-technical levels,” the Governor said and concluded saying “A powerful lesson 
from the financial crisis has been that financial sector development is not, and cannot  3
be, an end in itself. The growth of the financial sector is important only to the extent it 
improves the growth of the real sector. For all of us in the Reserve Bank - indeed even 
for those outside it - engaged in financial sector issues, it is important to remember 
that what we do in the financial sector adds value if and only if it makes a difference to 
the lives of ordinary people.”

Mint Road Milestones: RBI At 75 
‘Mint Road Milestones: RBI At 75’, is a chronology compiled to mark the 
Platinum Jubilee year of the Reserve Bank of India. The chronology is preceded by an 
introductory which presents a brief history and also initiates the reader to the role and 
responsibilities of country's central bank. The publication has been an attempt to put 
central banking in the context of the broader socio-political developments of the day, 
both in the world and domestically. The Reserve Bank’s journey is supported by 
visuals and vignettes that provide glimpses into its eventful past and the road it has

in the developing world. Mint Road Milestones: RBI at 75 is a part of the Reserve 
Bank’s effort to advance financial education. It is hoped that the Book will be 
welcomed by all those interested in banking and finance - students, professionals and 
general public alike.
