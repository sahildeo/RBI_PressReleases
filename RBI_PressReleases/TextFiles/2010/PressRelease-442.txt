Committee on Customer Service in Banks - 
Date for Final Report submission extended 
 
 The Committee on Customer Service in Banks (Chairman Shri M. 
Damodaran) constituted by the Reserve Bank of India has been granted extension 
of time upto January 14, 2011 to submit its final report and recommendations. The 
report was originally to be submitted on October 14, 2010. The extension of time for 
submission of the report has been necessitated due to the volume of work required 
to be undertaken by the Committee to fulfill its mandate in regard to the terms of 
reference and purpose for which it has been constituted. 
 
 It may be recalled that the Reserve Bank of India, had in June 2010, set up a 
Committee to look into banking services rendered to retail and small customers, 
including pensioners and also look into the system of grievance redressal 
mechanism prevalent in banks, its structure and efficacy and suggest measures for 
expeditious resolution of complaints.
