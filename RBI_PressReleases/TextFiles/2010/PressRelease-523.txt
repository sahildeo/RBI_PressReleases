performance indicators of all scheduled commercial banks, excluding regional rural 
banks, for the period 2005-06 to 2009-10. The publication covers about 18 important

namely, business per employee and profit per employee at aggregate level, 
are increasing since 2005-06.  
ï Number of employees of all banks increased during 2009-10.

declined during 2009-10. At bank group level, return on assets of all the bank 
groups with the exception of private sector banks witnessed a decline during 
2009-10. The improvement in return on assets of private sector banks is
