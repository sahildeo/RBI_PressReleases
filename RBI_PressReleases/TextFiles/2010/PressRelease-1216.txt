RBI Guidelines on Note Authentication and Fitness Sorting Parameters 
The Reserve Bank of India has today released the guidelines on Note 
Authentication and Fitness Sorting Parameters. 
The objective of these guidelines is to ensure uniform determination of the 
quality of banknotes by standardisation of the performance parameters of note 
sorting machines. 
It may be recalled that the draft guidelines were placed on RBI's website on 
December 23, 2009. The guidelines have been finalised after taking into account the 
comments received from various stakeholders including banks, equipment 
manufacturers and members of public.
