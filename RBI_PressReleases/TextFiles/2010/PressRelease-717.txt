Over-the-Counter Derivative Markets in India: Issues and Perspectives 
 
The article ‘Over-the-Counter Derivative Markets in India: Issues and 
Perspectives’ by Shyamala Gopinath, originally published in July 2010 Issue of 
Financial Stability Review, Banque de France, puts in perspective the boundary 
conditions imposed by the macroeconomic constraints, which have guided the evolution 
of over-the-counter (OTC) markets in India. It underlines the point that the process of 
transiting from a predominantly OTC based model to an exchange-traded model needs 
to follow a calibrated path. Through this transition period, the overall regulatory 
approach towards OTC derivative markets is as important as addressing the 
transactional aspects. 
 
Main Findings 
 
The article analyses the underlying rationale of the key regulatory stipulations for 
OTC derivatives and identifies the issues in going forward. The main issues to be 
addressed are identified as contract standardisation, bilateral collateralisation, push 
towards central clearing, higher capital requirements for non-cleared trades, and the 
role of bespoke products. The article concludes that the reform of OTC derivatives 
cannot be disassociated from the larger perspective of the too-big-to-fail issue, at the 
heart of which is limiting the proprietary trading by banks. The article argues for 
concentrating on stronger entity regulation and conduct of business aspect of the 
financial markets.  
 
Survey on Software & Information Technology Services Exports: 2008-09 
 
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) conducted an annual comprehensive survey on 
exports of software and information technology services. For estimating the quarterly 
software services exports, a sample survey was also conducted for the quarters April –  2
June (Q1), July- September (Q2) and October – December (Q3) 2008.The significant 
findings of the latest survey for the period 2008-2009 are:  
 
Main Findings 
 
• Total Computer Services and Information Technology Enabled Services (ITES)/ 
Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) services exports of India during 2008-09 
were estimated at Rs.1,67,240 crore (US$ 36.4 billion), of which computer 
services exports was Rs.1,21,956 crore (US$ 26.6 billion).  
 
• Quarterly survey results revealed that export from India on account of software 
services in Q1 was 21 per cent of total global software services exports in 2008-
09, increasing to 25 per cent and 26 per cent in Q2 and Q3, respectively. 
  
• The share of software export in the last quarter of 2008-09 was the highest at 28 
per cent. Of the total software exports (Computer and ITES/BPO services), 
around 72 per cent was through offsite services while onsite software exports 
accounted for 28 per cent. 
  
• United States (US) was the major destination for software exports accounting for 
60 per cent share in total software exports. Among the European countries which 
contributed 27 per cent in total India's software exports, the United Kingdom 
(UK) alone accounted for 14 per cent. 
 
• US Dollar was the major currency for invoicing software exports, with a share of 
75 per cent in total software exports. Pound Sterling and EURO accounted for 13 
and 6 per cent, respectively. 
  
• The international trade in software services exports covering all modes of supply 
as per Manual on Statistics of International Trade in Services (MSITS [2002]) 
was estimated at Rs. 2,00,935 crore (US$ 43.8 billion). Mode-1 (cross border 
supply) accounted for the 56 per cent of total international trade in software 
services by India, while Mode-4 (presence of natural person) and Mode-3 
(commercial presence) had 27 and 17 per cent share, respectively and the 
lowest being Mode-2 (consumption abroad) with a share of 0.1 per cent. 
 
Corporate Investment: Growth in 2009-10 and Prospects in 2010 
 
This article captures capital expenditure intentions of the companies in private and joint 
business sector in order to broadly assess the likely short-term changes in business 
investment. The estimation of capital investment during a year is based on time phasing 
details of the investment intentions indicated by the companies while raising funds from 
banks/financial institutions, external commercial borrowings and domestic equity.  
 
Main Findings 
 
• The aggregated capital investment plans reflect a continuation of upturn in the 
investment cycle which began in 2002-03. 
  
• The investment intentions of the institutionally assisted companies in 2009-10 
aggregated to Rs.5,56,011 crore. 
  
• The investment rally was led primarily by high value projects envisaged in power, 
telecom and metal and metal products. 
  
• Spatial pattern of proposed projects showed that Orissa was the most favoured 
State capturing 13.4 per cent of total investment intentions followed by 
Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. 
 
• Based on time phasing details that reflect the intentions over the implementation 
period of projects intended in various years, capital expenditure that might have  3
been incurred in 2009-10 worked out to be Rs.3,44,633 crore, of which 
Rs.1,82,134 crore was envisaged in 1070 new projects added in the database in 
2009-10 itself.  
 
Going forward, accelerating capital goods production, favourable demand 
conditions, increasing levels of capacity utilisation in some sectors and rebound in 
corporate earnings in the second half of 2009-10 are likely to support new investment 
decisions. Recent indications of an improvement in business sentiments on the back of 
improved outlook on demand conditions indicate that capital investment climate in 
2010-11 is likely to remain conducive.  
 
Finances of Public Limited Companies, 2008-09 
 
The article on Finances of Public Limited Companies, 2008-09 analyses the 
financial performance of select 3,192 non-government non-financial public limited 
companies, based on their audited annual accounts, closed during April 2008 to March 
2009. Compared to 28.1 per cent in the previous study, the select 3,192 companies, as 
on March 31, 2009 accounted for 35.8 per cent of total paid-up capital (provisional 
estimate supplied by Ministry of Corporate Affairs, Government of India) of all non-
government non financial public limited companies. 
 
Main Findings 
 
• The unprecedented global financial crisis during the year under study made an 
impact on the Indian private corporate sector, especially on the profitability. 
  
• Growth in sales of the select companies was moderated to 14.6 per cent in 
2008-09 (21.1 per cent in 2007-08). 
 
• Manufacturing expenses and remuneration to employees moderated to 15.4 per 
cent and 19.0 per cent, respectively in 2008-09. These were 21.4 per cent and 
25.1 per cent, respectively in 2007-08. 
 
• Total outstanding borrowing and borrowings from banks continued to grow at 
higher rate by 29.0 per cent and 30.0 per cent, respectively in 2008-09. These 
were 28.9 per cent and 37.0 per cent, respectively in 2007-08. The share of 
incremental bank borrowings in total external sources of funds raised by the 
select companies during the year 2008-09 increased to 34.1 per cent from 32.0 
per cent during 2007-08. Consequently, interest payments, continued to grow at 
high rate of 42.7 per cent in 2008-09 on top of 32.7 per cent growth in the 
previous year. 
  
• The share of external sources of funds (i.e., other than own sources) to total 
sources of funds increased to 68.4 per cent during 2008-09 from 64.5 per cent 
during 2007-08, due to fall in internal sources of fund. 
 
• The debt to equity (debt as percentage of equity) increased to 43.6 per cent in 
2008-09 (42.8 per cent in previous year) in line with the higher growth in 
borrowing. 
 
• Growth in gross profits and profits after tax reversed its positive growth path after 
six years and registered a sharp decline by (-)9.8 per cent and (-)16.7 per cent, 
respectively in 2008-09. 
  
• Profit margin (gross profits as percentage of sales) as well as return on equity 
(profits after tax as percentage of net worth) dropped significantly by 3.4 
percentage points to 12.6 per cent (16.0 per cent in previous year) and by 5.4 
percentage points to 11.8 per cent (17.2 per cent in previous year), respectively 
in 2008-09. However, the ratio of profits retained to profit after tax marginally  4
increased to 81.2 per cent in 2008-09 from 80.4 per cent in 2007-08 (considering 
only the profit making companies in all three years).  
 
International Banking Statistics of India: September 2009 
 
The article on ‘International Banking Statistics of India: September 2009’ 
presents analysis of international liabilities and assets of banks in India. Classified 
under Locational Banking Statistics (LBS) and consolidated international/foreign claims 
under Consolidated Banking Statistics (CBS), the data for this study is collected as per 
the reporting system of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), for the quarter 
ended September 2009. 
 
Main Findings 
 
Locational Banking Statistics 
 
• The international liabilities (in Rupees) of banks in India, as at end-September 
2009, grew by 11.9 per cent over the position a year ago and by 6.7 per cent 
over the previous quarter. 
  
• The investment in the ADRs/ GDRs and equities of the banking sector by non-
residents registered a substantial growth over previous quarter as well as the 
previous year. 
 
• For the quarter ended September 2009, currency composition of the 
international liabilities revealed that the Indian Rupee continued to be the 
dominating currency. The share of the international liabilities towards the non-
bank sector increased gradually to 76.2 per cent from 68.3 per cent a year ago. 
 
• At end-September 2009, the international assets (in Rupees) of banks in India 
grew marginally by 0.3 per cent over the position a year ago, while the assets 
declined by 4.0 per cent over the previous quarter. 
 
• The outstanding export bills drawn on non-residents registered a substantial 
increase of 16.4 per cent over the previous quarter, pushing its share in the total 
international assets to 20.7 per cent from 17.0 per cent in the previous quarter. 
  
• For the quarter, the share of the non-bank sector in the international assets 
increased to 65.1 per cent from 55.6 per cent for the previous quarter. The 
corresponding share was 72.9 per cent a year ago. At end-September 2009, 
almost all (98.7 per cent) assets denominated in Indian Rupee were towards 
non-bank sector.  
 
Consolidated Banking Statistics 
 
The annual growth in consolidated international claims (in Rupees) of banks 
based on country of immediate risk, at end-September 2009, was 23.5 per cent 
compared to 13.0 per cent registered a year ago. Consolidated international claims of 
Indian banks on immediate risk basis, at end-September 2009, continued to be of short-
term nature (less than one year) and accounted for 61.0 per cent of total claims 
compared to 63.1 per cent a year ago.  
 
QE of National Income, 2008-09 and RE of National Income, 2009-10: A Review 
 
The article on ‘Quick Estimates (QE) of National Income, 2008-09 and Revised 
Estimates (RE) of National Income, 2009-10: A Review’ reviews the trends in various 
macro-economic aggregates as given in the quick and revised estimates of national 
income released by the Central Statistical Organisation (CSO) in January and May 
2010. With these releases, the CSO has changed the base year of national accounts 
statistics from 1999-2000 to 2004-05. 
   5
Main Findings 
 
According to the revised estimates for 2009-10, the real GDP growth increased 
to 7.4 per cent from 6.7 per cent in 2008-09. The recovery of GDP growth was mainly 
driven by industry, while agriculture and services witnessed some moderation in 
growth. The industrial sector witnessed a sharp recovery driven by manufacturing 
sector. However, the agriculture growth decreased due to fall in kharif production on 
account of weak South-West monsoon. The lower growth in services sector was mainly 
on account of moderation in the growth of ‘community, social & personal services’ 
reflecting largely the base effect of a high growth witnessed in 2008-09.  
 
The article has also analysed the trend of gross domestic saving and investment. 
As per quick estimates for 2008-09, the gross domestic saving and investment rates 
significantly moderated after reaching their peaks in 2007-08. In 2008-09, the gross 
domestic saving rate moderated due to fall in public sector saving on account of fiscal 
stimulus related expenditure to revive the economy from slowdown, as also the 
massive disbursement on account of implementation of Sixth Pay Commission Award. 
The gross domestic investment rate also decreased due to fall in private corporate 
investment rate in 2008-09.  
 
India’s Foreign Trade: 2010-11 (April-May) 
 
The article on ‘India’s Foreign Trade: 2010-11 (April-May)’ reviews India’s 
merchandise trade performance during 2010-11 (April-May) on the basis of data 
released by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry and Directorate General of 
Commercial Intelligence and Statistics (DGCI&S). The article also covers 
disaggregated commodity-wise and direction-wise analysis of India’s trade during the 
period April-December 2009. 
 
Main Findings 
 
The article observes that during April-May (2010-11), India’s merchandise 
exports at US$ 33.0 billion posted a growth of 33.2 per cent over the corresponding 
period of previous year as against a decline of 33.3 per cent during April-May (2009-
10). Merchandise imports at US$ 54.7 billion recorded a growth of 39.5 per cent as 
against a decline of 34.3 per cent during April-May (2009-10). The oil and non-oil 
imports registered a growth of 68.5 per cent and 29.6 per cent in April-May (2010-11), 
respectively, as against a decline of 48.3 per cent and 27.6 per cent in April-May (2009-
10). Further, the disaggregated data on commodity-wise merchandise trade as well as 
source and direction of exports and imports reveal that trade of all major commodity 
groups (viz., primary products, manufactured goods, petroleum products and bulk and 
non bulk import items) and with major trading partners (viz., OECD, OPEC, Eastern 
Europe and Developing Countries) registered a decline during April-December 2009 
over the corresponding period of previous year.
