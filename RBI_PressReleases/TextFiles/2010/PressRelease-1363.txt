Reserve Bank Cancels the Licence of National Co-operative Bank Ltd., 
Kurnool, Dist. Kurnool, (Andhra Pradesh) 
In view of the fact that National Co-operative Bank Ltd., Kurnool, Dist. 
Kurnool, (Andhra Pradesh) had defaulted in repayment of deposits, was a chronic 
defaulter in submission of statutory returns since 2005, had failed to produce audited 
balance sheets since 2005 and all efforts to ensure regulatory compliance  in 
consultation with the Government of Andhra Pradesh had failed and the depositors 
were being inconvenienced by continued uncertainty, the Reserve Bank of India 
delivered the order canceling its licence to the bank after the close of business on 
April 7,  2010. The Registrar of Co-operative Societies, Andhra Pradesh State has 
also been requested to issue an order for winding up the bank and appoint a 
liquidator for the bank.  It may be highlighted that on liquidation, every depositor is 
entitled to repayment of his/her deposits up to a monetary ceiling of Rs. 1,00,000/- 
(Rupees one lakh only) from the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee 
Corporation (DICGC) under usual terms and conditions.  
The bank was granted a licence by Reserve Bank on June 16, 1999 to 
commence banking business.  The statutory inspection conducted with reference to 
the financial position as on March 31, 2007, revealed that the bank could not submit 
the audited accounts for the financial years 2005-06 and 2006-07 and failed to 
submit statements and other related documents. It was observed that Board of 
Directors of the bank was ineffective and responsible for non-compliance with 
various statutory requirements. As such the Registrar of Co-operative Societies, 
Andhra Pradesh, was issued a requisition to supersede the Board of Directors of the 
bank on August 3, 2009 and appoint an Administrator to look after the affairs of the 
bank.  
The statutory inspection of the bank under Section 35 of the Banking 
Regulation Act 1949 (AACS) with reference to its financial position as on March 31, 
2009, could not be conducted as the bank had not made available records such as 
Trial Balance, audited / un audited Balance Sheet and Profit & Loss Account for the 
year ended March 31, 2009, the NPA Register, discharged FDRs, documents for 
loans and other basic records.  
The Reserve Bank of India issued a show cause notice to the bank on 
September 3, 2009, asking it to show cause as to why the licence granted to it to 
conduct banking business should not be cancelled. The bankís reply to the show 
cause notice was not found satisfactory. The bank did not submit any 
comprehensive and realistic time bound action plan to rectify the serious deficiencies 
in its functioning. In the absence of any viable action plan to comply with statutory 
requirements, the Reserve Bank of India took the extreme measure of cancelling 
licence of the bank in the interest of the bank's depositors. With the cancellation of its 2 
 
licence and commencement of liquidation proceedings, the process of paying the 
depositors of National Co-operative Bank Ltd., Kurnool, Dist. Kurnool, (Andhra 
Pradesh) will be set in motion subject to the terms and conditions of the Deposit 
Insurance Scheme.   
Consequent to the cancellation of its licence, National Co-operative Bank Ltd., 
Kurnool, Dist. Kurnool, (Andhra Pradesh), is prohibited from carrying on ëbanking 
businessí as defined in Section 5(b) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (AACS) 
including acceptance and repayment of deposits.
