Developments in India's Balance of Payments  
during October-December 2009 
 
Preliminary data on Indiaís Balance of Payments (BoP) for the third quarter (Q3) 
i.e., October-December 2009 of the financial year 2009-10, are now available. Based 
on these preliminary data and the partially revised data for the first two quarters i.e., 
April-June 2009 (Q1) and July-September 2009 (Q2), the BoP data for the period April-
December 2009 of the current financial year 2009-10 have been compiled, which are 
set out in the standard format of BoP presentation in Statements I and II. 
  
Major Highlights of BoP  
 
(i) Exports recorded a growth of 13.2 per cent during Q3 of 2009-10 over the 
corresponding quarter of the previous year, after consecutive declines in the last 
four quarters. 
 
(ii) Imports registered a growth of 2.6 per cent in Q3 of 2009-10 after recording 
consecutive declines in the last three quarters. 
 
(iii) Private transfer receipts remained robust during Q3 of 2009-10. 
 
(iv) Despite low trade deficit, the current account deficit was higher at US$ 12.0 billion 
during Q3 of 2009-10 mainly due to lower invisibles surplus. 
 
(v) The current account deficit during April-December 2009 was higher at US$ 30.3 
billion as compared to US$ 27.5 billion during April-December 2008. 
 
(vi) Surplus in capital account increased sharply to US$ 43.2 billion during April-
December 2009 (US$ 5.8 billion during April-December 2008) mainly on account 
of large inflows under FDI, Portfolio investment, NRI deposits and commercial 
loans. 
 
(vii) As the surplus in capital account exceeded the current account deficit, there was a 
net accretion to foreign exchange reserves of US$ 11.3 billion during April-
December 2009 (as against a drawdown of US$ 20.4 billion during April-
December 2008).  2
Balance of Payments for October-December (Q3) of 2009-10

(i) Indiaís merchandise exports recorded a growth of 13.2 per cent in Q3 of 2009-10 
as against a decline of 8.4 per cent in Q3 of 2008-09. 
(ii) Import payments while, on a BoP basis, registered a growth of 2.6 per cent in Q3 
of 2009-10 as compared with an increase of 9.2 per cent in Q3 of 2008-09, grew 
by 6.6 per cent on Directorate General of Commercial Intelligence and Statistics 
(DGCI&S) basis during the quarter under review. The low growth in imports is 
mainly attributed to decline in oil related import payments due to lower 
international crude oil prices during the period. 
(iii) The trade deficit, on a BoP basis, was lower at US$ 30.7 billion as compared to 
US$ 34.0 billion during Q3 of 2008-09. 
(iv) The decline in invisibles receipts, which started in the Q4 of 2008-09, continued 
during Q3 of 2009-10.  Invisibles receipts registered a decline of 3.1 per cent 
during the quarter (as against an increase of 5.4 per cent in Q3 of 2008-09) mainly 
on account of decline in business, communication and financial services, and 
investment income receipts. Although, software exports recorded a robust growth 
of 15.3 per cent, services exports as a whole witnessed a decline of 12.3 per cent 
during the quarter as against an increase of 11.8 per cent during the 
corresponding quarter of 2008-09.   
(v) Invisibles payments recorded a growth of 12.9 per cent during Q3 of 2009-10, as 
compared with a low growth of 2.4 per cent in Q3 of 2008-09, mainly led by 
increase in payments under almost all components of services.  
(vi)  As decline in services exports was made up by strong private transfers receipts 
(24.1 per cent in Q3 of 2009-10), net invisibles (invisibles receipts minus invisibles 
payments) recorded a surplus of US$ 18.7 billion in Q3 of 2009-10 (US$ 22.4 
billion in Q3 of 2008-09).  3
(vii) Size of invisibles surplus in Q3 of 2009-10 was, however, lower than Q3 of 
preceding year. Therefore, despite low trade deficit, the current account deficit 
was higher at US$ 12.0 billion in Q3 of 2009-10 (US$ 11.7 billion in Q3 of 2008-
09).  
(viii) Continuing buoyancy in capital inflows mainly led by large inflows under foreign 
direct investments, portfolio investments and short-term trade credits resulted in a 
net capital account surplus of US$ 14.7 billion during Q3 of 2009-10 as against a 
net deficit of US$ 6.1 billion during Q3 of 2008-09.  
(ix) Net FDI flows (net inward FDI minus net outward FDI) amounted to US$ 3.9 billion 
in Q3 of 2009-10 (US$ 0.4 billion in Q3 of 2008-09). Net inward FDI stood at US$ 
7.1 billion during Q3 of 2009-10 (US$ 6.3 billion in Q3 of 2008-09). Net outward 
FDI remained lower at US$ 3.2 billion in Q3 of 2009-10 (US$ 5.9 billion in Q3 of 
2008-09). Net portfolio investments were higher at US$ 5.7 billion mainly 
supported by strong net inflows by the foreign institutional investors amounting to 
US$5.3 billion during Q3 of 2009-10. 
(x) Net External Commercial Borrowings (ECBs) remained lower at US$ 1.5 billion in 
Q3 of 2009-10 (US$ 3.8 billion in Q3 of 2008-09) mainly due to increased 
repayments and low disbursements of commercial loans to India. Short-term trade 
credits to India recorded a net inflow of US$ 3.3 billion in Q3 of 2009-10 as 
against a net outflow of US$ 4.2 billion during Q3 of 2008-09.   
(xi) Net inflows under banking capital was higher at US$ 1.9 billion mainly due to 
drawdown of foreign assets of commercial banks and a net inflow of US$ 0.6 
billion under non-resident Indian (NRI) deposits.  
(xii) There was an increase in foreign exchange reserves on BoP basis (i.e., excluding 
valuation) of US$ 1.8 billion in Q3 of 2009-10 as against a decline of US$ 17.9 
billion in Q3 of 2008-09. In nominal terms (including valuation changes), foreign 
exchange reserves rose by US$ 2.2 billion during Q3 of 2009-10.  
1. Balance of Payments (BoP) for April-December 2009 
Table 2 and Statement II present developments in major items of BoP 
during April-December 2009. Major developments are as under: 
(i) On a BoP basis, Indiaís merchandise exports posted a decline of 17.3 per cent in 
April-December 2009 (as against a high growth of 27.5 per cent in the 
corresponding period of the previous year).  
(ii) Import payments, on a BoP basis, also remained lower recording a decline of 14.0 
per cent during April-December 2009 as compared with a high growth of 35.6 per 
cent in the corresponding period of the previous year.  
(iii) According to the DGCI&S data, exports declined by 17.3 per cent, and imports 
growth was negative at 22.0 per cent led by the decline in both oil imports (a 
decline of 29.7 per cent) and non-oil imports (a decline of 18.4 per cent) during 
April-December 2009.  4

(iv) On a BoP basis, the merchandise trade deficit decreased to US$ 89.5 billion 
during April-December 2009 from US$ 98.4 billion in April-December 2008 mainly 
on account of both lower oil and non-oil import payments (Chart 1).

(v) Invisible receipts recorded a decline of 7.7 per cent during April-December 2009, 
as compared with an increase of 22.2 per cent in the corresponding period of the 
previous year, mainly due to the lower receipts under almost all components of 
services coupled with lower investment income receipts (Table 3 and Chart 2).  
(vi) Private transfer receipts, comprising mainly remittances from Indians working 
overseas, increased to US$ 40.8 billion in April-December 2009 from US$ 37.1 
billion in the corresponding period of the previous year. Private transfer receipts 
constituted 16.9 per cent of current receipts in April-December 2009 (13.4 per cent 
in the corresponding period of the previous year). Under Private transfers, the 
inward remittances for family maintenance accounted for about 52.7 per cent of 
the total private transfer receipts, while local withdrawals accounted for about 43.7 
per cent in April-December 2009.

(viii) Invisibles payments witnessed a positive growth of 3.7 per cent in April-December 
2009 (10.4 per cent in April-December 2008) mainly supported by higher 
business, communication and financial services, and increase in payments under 
investment income account.

December 2008. At this level, the invisibles surplus financed 66.1 per cent of trade 
deficit during April-December 2009 as against 72.0 per cent during April-
December 2008. 
(x) Despite lower trade deficit, decline in invisibles surplus led to higher current 
account deficit at US$ 30.3 billion in April-December 2009 (US$ 27.5 billion during 
April-December 2008) (Chart 3).

(xi) Net capital flows at US$ 43.2 billion in April-December 2009 was much higher as 
compared with US$ 5.8 billion in April-December 2008 mainly due to larger inflows

(xii) Due to lower outward FDI, the net FDI (inward FDI minus outward FDI) was higher 
at US$ 16.5 billion in April-December 2009 as compared with US$ 14.3 billion in 
April-December 2008. 
(xiii) Portfolio investment witnessed large net inflows of US$ 23.6 billion during April-
December 2009 as against a net outflow of US$ 11.3 billion in April-December 
2008 due to large net FII inflows of US$ 20.5 billion.  
(xiv) Net external commercial borrowings (ECBs) inflow slowed down to US$ 2.3 billion 
in April-December 2009 (US$ 6.9 billion in April-December 2008) mainly due to 
increased repayments. 
(xv)  The increase in foreign exchange reserves on BoP basis (i.e., excluding 
valuation) was US$ 11.3 billion in April-December 2009 (as against a sharp 
decline in reserves of US$ 20.4 billion in April-December 2008). [A Press Release 
on the Sources of Variation in Foreign Exchange Reserves is separately issued]. 
2. Comparison of RBI and DGCI&S Imports Data 
During April-December 2009, based on the records of the DGCI&S imports data 
and the BoP merchandise imports, the difference between the two data sets works out 
to about US$ 16.0 billion (Table 5).
