The Reserve Bank of India has imposed a monetary penalty of Rs.5.00 lakh 
(Rupees Five Lakh only) on Bhandari Co-operative Bank Ltd., Dadar, Maharashtra in 
exercise of powers vested in it under the provisions of Section 47A(1)(b) read with 
Section 46(4) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (As Applicable to Co-operative

i) sanctioned unsecured advances beyond the ceiling of Rs.50,000/- 
prescribed to Grade IV bank having Demand and Time Liabilities (DTL) 
of more that Rs.10.00 crore, in violation of Reserve Bank of India's 
directive on maximum limit on unsecured advances to single 
party/connected group. 
 
ii) resorted to evergreening of accounts by closing non-performing loans, 
thus violating the RBI's guidelines on Income Recognition and Asset

response to which the bank submitted a written reply. Based on the reply, the 
Reserve Bank of India came to the conclusion that the violation was substantiated 
and warranted imposition of penalty. Accordingly, it penalised the bank.
