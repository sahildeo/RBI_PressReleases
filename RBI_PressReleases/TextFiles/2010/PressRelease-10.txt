Sources of Variation in Foreign Exchange Reserves 
in India during April-September 2010 
Earlier today, the Reserve Bank of India released the Balance of Payments 
(BoP) data for the second quarter (July-September) of 2010 on its website 
(www.rbi.org.in). On the basis of these data along with the revised data for earlier 
quarters, this note on sources of variation in foreign exchange reserves during April-
September 2010 has been compiled.  
Sources of Variation in Foreign Exchange Reserves: April-September 2010 
During April-September 2010, there was an accretion to the foreign exchange 
reserves in BoP terms (i.e. excluding valuation effects). The sources of variation in 
the foreign exchange reserves are set out in Table 1.

On a balance of payments basis (i.e., excluding valuation effects), the foreign 
exchange reserves increased by US$ 7.0 billion during April-September 2010 as 
against an increase of US$ 9.5 billion during April-September 2009. The foreign 
exchange reserves (including the valuation effects) increased by US$ 13.8 billion 
during April-September 2010 as compared with an increase of US$ 29.3 billion 
during April-September 2009 (Table 2).

4. Percentage of increase/decline in Reserves  67.7 49.3 
explained by Valuation Gain/Loss   
Note: Increase in reserves (+)/Decrease in reserves (-). 
The valuation gains, reflecting the depreciation of the US dollar against major 
currencies, accounted for US$ 6.8 billion during April-September 2010 as compared 
with valuation gains of US$ 19.8 billion during April-September 2009. Accordingly, 
valuation gains accounted for 49.3 per cent of the total increase in foreign exchange 
reserves during April-September 2010.
