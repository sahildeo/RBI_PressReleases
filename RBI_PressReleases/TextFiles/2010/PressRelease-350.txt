RBI Sub Committee of the Central Board of Directors  
to study Issues and Concerns in MFI Sector 
 
The Sub-Committee of the Reserve Bankís Central Board of Directors today 
finalised its terms of reference. The Sub-Committee chaired by Shri Y H Malegam, a 
senior member of the Reserve Bankís Central Board of Directors was set up after the 
Boardís October meeting to study issues and concerns in the micro finance sector. 
The terms of reference are:   
 
1. To review the definition of ëmicrofinanceí and ëMicro Finance Institutions 
(MFIs)í for the purpose of regulation of non-banking finance companies 
(NBFCs) undertaking microfinance by the Reserve Bank of India and make 
appropriate recommendations. 
 
2. To examine the prevalent practices of MFIs in regard to interest rates, lending 
and recovery practices to identify trends that impinge on borrowersí interests.  
 
3. To delineate the objectives and scope of regulation of NBFCs undertaking 
microfinance by the Reserve Bank and the regulatory framework needed to 
achieve those objectives. 
 
4. To examine and make appropriate recommendations in regard to applicability 
of    money lending legislation of the States and other relevant laws to 
NBFCs/MFIs. 
 
5. To examine the role that associations and bodies of MFIs could play in 
enhancing transparency disclosure and best practices 
 
6. To recommend a grievance redressal machinery that could be put in place for 
ensuring adherence to the regulations recommended at 3 above. 
 
7. To examine the conditions under which loans to MFIs can be classified as 
priority sector lending and make appropriate recommendations.  
 
8. To consider any other item that is relevant to the terms of reference. 
 
There have been some concerns in the recent past expressed in the media 
about high interest rates, coercive recovery processes and multiple lending practised 
by some microfinance institutions. In order to study these and other related issues 
and implications for its policies and given the useful role played by the microfinance institutions in providing access to financial services to the poor and excluded, the 
Reserve Bank of India set up a Sub-Committee of the Central Board of Directors of 
the Reserve Bank to study the issues and concerns in this sector, including ways 
and means of making interest rates charged by them reasonable. Shri Y H Malegam, 
a senior member on the Central Board of Directors of the Reserve Bank of India will 
chair the Sub-Committee.  Other members of the Sub-Committee include, Smt. 
Shashi Rajagopalan, Shri U R Rao, Shri Kumar Mangalam Birla and Dr. K C 
Chakrabarty, Deputy Governor. Shri V K Sharma, Executive Director, Reserve Bank 
of India will be the Member Secretary to the Sub-Committee. The Sub-Committee 
will submit its report in three months.  
The Reserve Bank of India regulates only those microfinance institutions 
which are registered with it as non-banking finance companies. Although the 
registered companies cover over 80 per cent of the microfinance business, in terms 
of number of companies they constitute a small percentage of the total number of 
MFIs in the country.  The Reserve Bank, however, does not prescribe lending rates 
for these institutions.
