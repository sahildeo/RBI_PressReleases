The Reserve Bank of India is organising an international research conference on 
"Challenges to Central Banking in the Context of Financial Crisis". The conference will

The theme of the Conference, ìChallenges to Central Banking in the Context of 
Financial Crisis", is of contemporary relevance, which sketches a broad canvas of 
issues emanating from the crisis that could redefine the role of central banks. The 
various sessions in the two-day conference will address issues, such as, the challenges 
and response to conduct monetary policy during the financial crisis; globalisation, 
market failures and challenges posed to central banks; disruptions in financial systems 
and challenges to regulation and supervision; and financial stability as an objective of 
monetary policy. The conference would provide a useful forum to exchange views and 
research findings on issues relevant from a central bank's perspective, which would 
provide valuable insights into the policy making.
