Participants to report Repos in Corporate Bonds on 
FIMMDA platform from August 2, 2010 
 
The Reserve Bank of India has today communicated that all participants shall 
report their repo trades in corporate bonds on the Fixed Income Money Market and 
Derivatives Association of India (FIMMDA) platform beginning August 02, 2010. 
Further, the participants shall continue to report their repo trades to the clearing 
corporations, i.e., National Securities Clearing Corporation Ltd. (NSCCL)/ Indian 
Clearing Corporation Limited (ICCL) for settlement on Delivery vs Payment-I  (DvP-I) 
basis. 
It may be recalled that in terms of the Repo in Corporate Debt Securities 
(Reserve Bank) Directions, 2010 dated January 08, 2010 (which came into effect 
from March 01, 2010) participants were required to report their repo trades in 
corporate bonds within 15 minutes of the trade on FIMMDA Reporting Platform. 
They were required to report them to the clearing corporations of the exchanges, 
i.e., NSCCL or ICCL for settlement. The Directions were effective March 01, 2010. 
However, on March 23, 2010 the Reserve Bank of India clarified that the market 
participants should report their trades only to the clearing corporations, i.e., NSCCL 
and ICCL for settlement until the launch of the FIMMDA Reporting Platform. 
FIMMDA has now advised that their Corporate Bond Reporting Platform is now 
ready to accept repo trades in corporate bonds.
