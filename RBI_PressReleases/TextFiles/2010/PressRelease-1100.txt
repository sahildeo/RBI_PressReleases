Applications made to RBI can now be tracked on-line 
 
Applications made to various departments of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) 
can now be tracked on-line through the Application Tracking System (ATS). The 
Reserve Bank launched the Application Tracking System on its website for 
convenience of the public. The ATS, cannot be used for tracking complaints made 
under the Banking Ombudsman Scheme or any other complaints. 
 
For tracking the above applications made, the applicants will have to register 
on the RBI website (ATS link on the home page of www.rbi.org.in). The tracking 
system will generate a first time login password and send it to the applicant through 
email. The applicants must necessarily change their password on first login.  Through this 
facility, the applicant can then submit an online application, attach related documents, 
view it and track its movement.
