Reserve Bank Rejects the Licence Application of ñ 
The Ramkrishnapur Co-operative Bank Ltd., Howrah (West Bengal) 
In view of the fact that The Ramkrishnapur Co-operative Bank Ltd., Howrah 
(West Bengal), had ceased to be solvent, all efforts to revive it in close consultation 
with the Government of West Bengal had failed and the depositors were being 
inconvenienced by continued uncertainty, the Reserve Bank of India delivered the 
order rejecting its application for licence to the bank after the close of business on 
June 17, 2010. The Registrar of Co-operative Societies, West Bengal has also been 
requested to issue an order for winding up the bank and appoint a liquidator for the 
bank. It may be highlighted that on liquidation, every depositor is entitled to 
repayment of his/her deposits up to a monetary ceiling of Rs. 1,00,000/- (Rupees 
One lakh only) from the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation 
(DICGC) under usual terms and conditions.  
The Ramkrishnapur Co-operative Bank Ltd., Howrah (hereinafter referred to 
as the ëbankí) was registered as a co-operative society on January 30, 1965 and 
commenced banking business on February 14, 1965. It applied  for a  licence to the 
Reserve Bank of India on April 30, 1983 to conduct banking business under Section 
22 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (As Applicable to Co-operative Societies) ( 
hereinafter referred  to as 'the Act'). The statutory inspection of the bank with 
reference to its financial position as on March 31, 2007 revealed certain serious 
deficiencies. 
   The subsequent statutory inspection of the bank with respect to its position as 
on March 31, 2009 revealed that its financial position had deteriorated and was 
precarious. Due to precarious financial position and the liquidity crunch faced by the 
bank, it was placed under directions with effect from the close of business as on 
August 20, 2009 restricting, inter alia, withdrawal from deposit accounts up to 
Rs.1000/- per depositor.  
   The bank was advised to show cause as to why the application of the bank 
dated  April 30, 1983 for grant of licence  to carry on banking business under Section 
22 of the Act, should not be rejected  and the bank taken into liquidation vide letter 
UBD.CO.NSB.II/SCN.17/12.29.038/2009-10 dated September 04, 2009. The bank 
submitted its reply to SCN vide its letter dated October 08, 2009. The reply to the 
SCN was examined and was found unsatisfactory.   
Having regard to all these facts, the Reserve Bank of India is satisfied that 
allowing the bank to carry on banking business any further, would be detrimental to 
the interest of the present and future depositors. Hence, the application for grant of 
licence to conduct banking business deserves to be rejected. Accordingly, the 
application dated April 30, 1983 to grant licence to the Ramkrishnapur Co-operative 2 
 
Bank Ltd., Howrah, to conduct banking business in India under Section 22 of the Act 
is hereby rejected. This order makes it obligatory on the part of the bank to stop 
conducting 'banking business' within the meaning of Section 5(b) of the Act, 
including acceptance and repayment of deposits, with immediate effect. With the 
cancellation of its licence and commencement of liquidation proceedings, the 
process of paying the depositors of The Ramkrishnapur Co-operative Bank Ltd., 
Howrah (West Bengal) will be set in motion subject to the terms and conditions of the 
Deposit Insurance Scheme.   
 Consequent to the cancellation of its licence, the Ramkrishnapur Co-operative 
Bank Ltd., Howrah (West Bengal) is prohibited from carrying on banking business as 
defined in Section 5(b) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (AACS) including 
acceptance and repayment of deposits.

General Manager, Urban Banks Department, Reserve Bank of India, Kolkata. His
