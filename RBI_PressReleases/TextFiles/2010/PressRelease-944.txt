March and June are released by the Reserve Bank of India and those for the quarters 
ending September and December by the Ministry of Finance, Government of India. The 
external debt data are released with a lag of one quarter. The external debt data, as 
compiled in the standard format, as at end-March 2010 in Rupees and US dollar terms and

major developments relating to Indiaís external debt as at end-March 2010 are presented 
in the following paragraphs. 
Major Highlights  
 
(i) Indiaís external debt, as at end-March 2010, was placed at US $ 261.4 billion (18.9 
per cent of GDP) recording an increase of US $ 36.9 billion or 16.5 per cent over the 
end-March 2009 level on account of significant increase in IMF liabilities due to 
additional allocations of SDR, commercial borrowings, NRI deposits and short-term 
trade credits.  
(ii) Excluding the valuation effects due to depreciation of US dollar against other major 
international currencies and Indian Rupee, the stock of external debt has increased 
by US$ 30.4 billion over the stock as at end-March 2009.

2010 followed by short-term debt (20.1 per cent), NRI deposits (18.4 per cent) and 
multilateral debt (16.3 per cent). 
(iv) The debt service ratio increased to 5.5 per cent during 2009-10 as compared to 4.6 
per cent during 2008-09.  
(v) Based on residual maturity, short-term debt accounted for 41.2 per cent of the total 
external debt as at end-March 2010. Whereas the share of short-term debt, by 
original maturity, was 20.1 per cent of the total external debt stock.  
(vi) The ratio of short-term debt to foreign exchange reserves at 18.8 per cent as at end- 
March 2010 was higher compared to 17.2 per cent as at end-March 2009.

2. Valuation Changes 
(i) The valuation effect reflecting the depreciation of the US dollar against other major 
international currencies and Indian rupee resulted in an increase in Indiaís external 
2 debt by US$ 6.6 billion during 2009-10. This implies that excluding the valuation 
effects, the stock of external debt as at end-March 2010 would have increased by 
US$ 30.4 billion over the level at end-March 2009. 
(ii) Compared with the previous quarter (end-December 2009), the valuation effect 
reflecting the appreciation of the US dollar against other major international 
currencies and Indian rupee resulted in a decline of US$ 1.0 billion in Indiaís external 
debt. This implies that excluding the valuation effects, the stock of external debt as at 
end-March 2010 would have increased by US$ 10.6 billion over the level at end-
December 2009 (Table 2).

(ii) The increase in IMF liability at US$ 6.0 billion as at end-March 2010 was due to 
additional allocation to SDRs by the IMF amounting to US $ 4.7 billion under the 
3 general allocation on August 28, 2009 and US$ 0.3 billion under the special allocation 
on September 9, 2009.  
(iii) Trade credits (both long-term and short-term) increased, by US $ 10.0 billion, as at 
end-March 2010 compared to US$ 2.2 billion over the level at end-March 2009.

(v) The short-term debt increased by US$ 9.1 billion to US$ 52.5 billion as at end-March 
2010 as compared to US$ 43.4 billion as at end-March 2009 mainly on account of 
rise in short-term trade credits.   
(vi) Outstanding NRI deposits at US $ 48.1 billion as at end-March 2010 increased by 
US$ 6.5 billion over the level as at end-March 2009 mainly on account of valuation 
effects .  
 
4. Currency Composition of Indiaís External Debt

6. External Debt by Residual Maturity 
 
(i) While external debt is generally compiled in terms of original maturity, analysing the 
external debt, in particular short term debt in terms of residual maturity is important 
from the point of view of foreign exchange liquidity management and to ascertain the 
total foreign exchange outgo on account of debt service payments in the immediate 
future.  
5 (ii) The ëshort-term debt by residual maturityí comprises the repayments due under 
medium and long-term debt by original maturity during one year reference period 
along with the short-term debt with original maturity. The balance constitutes the long-
term debt by residual maturity.  
(iii) The repayments due within the next one year under medium and long-term debt 
constitute 51.3 per cent of the total short-term debt by residual maturity as at end-
March 2010. 
(iv) Based on residual maturity, the short-term debt accounted for 41.2 per cent of total 
external debt as at end-March 2010. The ratio of short-term debt by residual maturity 
to foreign exchange reserves worked out to 38.6 per cent at end-March 2010 (Table 
6).

7. Government and Non-Government External Debt 
(i) Government (Sovereign) external debt stood at US$ 67.1 billion as at end-March 
2010 as against US$ 54.8 billion as at end-March 2009. The share of Government 
external debt in the total external debt increased by 25.7 per cent as at end-March 
2010 from 24.4 per cent as at end-March 2009.   
(ii) The share of non-Government debt in total external debt has increased steadily over 
the period. As at end-March 2010, the share of non-Government debt in total external 
debt, however, declined to 74.3 per cent from 75.6 per cent at end-March 2009 (Table
