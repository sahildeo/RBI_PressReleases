Macroeconomic and Monetary Developments in 2009-10 
The Reserve Bank of India today released the document Macroeconomic and 
Monetary Developments in 2009-10, which serves as a background to the Monetary 
Policy Statement 2010-11 to be announced on April 20, 2010. 
Overall Assessment 
ï With the improving growth outlook, monetary and fiscal exit measures have 
started.  
 
ï While recovery in private demand needs to be stronger to reinforce the growth 
momentum, already elevated headline inflation suggests that the weight of policy 
balance may have to shift to containing inflation, since high inflation itself will 
dampen recovery in growth.  
 
ï In the emerging macroeconomic scenario, monetary policy management in 
2010-11 will be dominated by the challenge of moderating inflation and 
anchoring inflation expectations, while remaining supportive of growth impulses. 
Highlights 
Global Economic Conditions 
ï Recovery in the global economy picked up momentum in the fourth quarter of 
2009. The speed of recovery, however, remains significantly divergent. The 
projections for global output for 2010 generally point to consolidating recovery, 
led by the Emerging Market Economies (EMEs). The WTO projects world trade 
to stage a strong recovery in 2010. 
 
ï The risks to the overall global macroeconomic environment have, however, 
increased because of large public debt in advanced economies, on the back of 
concerns relating to reduction in potential output, high unemployment rates, 
impaired financial systems and premature exit from the policy stimulus.  
 
ï With stronger recovery in EMEs driven largely by domestic demand, improving 
exports and return of capital flows, EMEs face the risks of inflation and asset 
price build up. 
Indian Economy 
Output 
ï The Indian economy exhibited clear momentum in recovery, and despite the 
impact of a deficient monsoon on agricultural production, GDP growth for 2009-
10 has been estimated at 7.2 per cent, up from 6.7 per cent recorded in 2008-09.   
  2
ï Concerns about domestic output growth are now subdued as the recovery is 
getting more broad-based. This is the result of a rebound in industrial output, 
better prospects for the Rabi crop and continuing resilience of the services 
sector.  
ï Survey data suggest pick up in capacity utilization levels in recent months, which 
still remain below the previous peaks.  
ï Output growth in 2010-11 is expected to be higher than in 2009-10, assuming a 
normal monsoon. Support for sustained momentum in growth can be expected 
from all three major components, viz., agriculture, industry and services.  
Aggregate Demand 
ï Final consumption expenditure remained subdued during 2009-10, as growth in 
both private final consumption expenditure and government final consumption 
expenditure decelerated. Investment demand, particularly gross fixed capital 
formation, however, showed a gradual recovery during the year.  
ï While the momentum in investment demand is expected to continue, pick-up in 
private consumption demand could drive the recovery in growth. Growth in 
corporates sales, after remaining significantly depressed over four consecutive 
quarters, staged a strong recovery in Q3 of 2009-10, indicating improving private 
demand conditions. 
ï The fiscal exit, as planned in the Union Budget for 2010-11, would contribute to 
improving the overall medium-term growth outlook, even as going forward, 
greater emphasis on quality of fiscal adjustment would be necessary. 
External Economy 
ï Indiaís external sector position improved alongside the recovery in the global 
economy. After declining for 12 consecutive months, exports recovered in 
October 2009. Similarly, imports recovered in November 2009 following a phase 
of decline.  
 
ï Despite a lower trade deficit, the current account deficit widened during Aprilñ
December 2009, as compared with the corresponding period of the previous 
year. This is attributable to a fall in invisibles, particularly on account of business 
services. 
 
ï During 2009-10, foreign exchange reserves increased by US$ 27.1 billion, 
comprising mainly of increase in gold holdings (US$ 8.4 billion), SDRs (US$ 5.0 
billion) and foreign currency assets (US$ 13.3 billion). The bulk of the increase in 
foreign currency assets was on account of valuation.  
 
ï Net capital inflows can be expected to increase further during the current year 
reflecting the prospects of higher growth and larger interest rate differentials 
between India and the advanced economies. Like other EMEs, however, higher 
capital inflows could influence asset prices, domestic liquidity conditions and the 
exchange rate. This will have implications for monetary management.  
Monetary Conditions 
ï Reflecting the stronger recovery in economic activities, growth in broad money 
(M ) and flow of credit to the private sector exceeded the Reserve Bankís 
3
indicative projections for 2009-10.  
  3
ï While the increase in CRR effected by the Reserve Bank in its Third Quarter 
Policy Review of January 2010 led to some moderation in excess liquidity, 
overall liquidity conditions remain comfortable as reflected in the daily reverse 
repo operations.  
 
ï The banking systemís credit to the government was the prime driver of monetary 
expansion during the year. The flow of resources to commercial sector distinctly 
improved from both bank as well as non-bank sources.  
 
ï Going forward, the demand for money may increase with acceleration in 
recovery and the elevated level of inflation. 
Financial Markets 
ï With market activity returning to the pre-global crisis level, volatility in the 
domestic financial markets was much lower during 2009-10 than in the year 
before, when the crisis erupted. 
 
ï Despite considerable stability and the commencement of exit, markets faced 
concerns emerging from large government borrowings and the increase in 
inflation. This affected yields in the government bond market.  
 
ï The transmission of lower policy rates to the credit markets improved, albeit,   
slowly. 
 
ï Asset prices increased at a relatively faster pace in the recent months, reflecting 
optimism about the economyís prospects as well as easy liquidity conditions.  
 
ï With the revival of capital inflows, nominal exchange rate appreciated. Given 
higher domestic inflation, the appreciation in real terms was even higher.  
Inflation Situation 
ï Headline WPI inflation firmed up significantly during the fourth quarter of 2009-
10.  
 
ï The initial inflationary pressure was predominantly conditioned by rising food and 
fuel prices, reflecting the impact of a deficient monsoon on agricultural output 
and the increase in international crude prices.  In the second half of the year, 
with persistent supply side pressures, inflation became increasingly generalised.  
 
ï This is evident from the acceleration of inflation in non-food manufactured 
products from -0.4 per cent in November 2009 to 4.7 per cent in March 2010. 
 
ï Inflation, as measured by consumer price indices (CPIs) also remained high, 
though there was some moderation in February 2010.  
 
ï These inflationary conditions, coupled with the stronger momentum seen in the 
pace of economic recovery, created the compelling ground for altering the 
Reserve Bankís policy focus to anchoring inflation expectations. 
Risks to Growth  
ï Apart from monsoon-related uncertainty, there are downside risks to growth: 
First, private consumption demand needs to improve significantly to support 
the growth momentum.   4
Second, global recovery, despite gaining strength, is expected to remain 
fragile, which has implications for exports.  
Third, the exit from fiscal stimulus and the growth-supportive monetary policy, 
unless calibrated carefully, could impact the growth process.  
Finally, the domestic saving rate has exhibited some decline, led by significant 
decline in public sector savings.  This has adverse implications for the potential 
growth of the economy. 
ï Reserve Bankís Survey of Professional Forecasters suggests (median) growth 
for 2010-11 at about 8.2 per cent.    
Inflation Outlook 
ï Inflation can be expected to moderate over the next few months, from the peak 
levels seen in recent months. There are, however, upside risks to inflation: 
First, international commodity prices, particularly oil, have started to increase 
again. In several commodities, the import option for India to contain domestic 
inflation is limited, because of higher international prices.  
Second, the revival in private consumption demand and the bridging of the 
output-gap will add to inflationary pressures.  
Finally, it is important to guard against the risk of hardening of inflation 
expectations conditioned by near double digit headline WPI inflation.
