Reserve Bank Cancels the Licence of  
The Bahadarpur Urban Co-operative Bank Ltd., Bahadarpur, (Gujarat) 
In view of the fact that The Bahadarpur Urban Co-operative Bank Ltd., Bahadarpur 
(Gujarat), had ceased to be solvent, all efforts to revive it in close consultation with the 
Government of Gujarat had failed and the depositors were being inconvenienced by 
continued uncertainty, the Reserve Bank of India delivered the order cancelling its licence 
to the bank after the close of business on March 23, 2010 . The Registrar of Co-operative 
Societies, Gujarat has also been requested to issue an order for winding up the bank and 
appoint a liquidator for the bank. It may be highlighted that on liquidation, every depositor is 
entitled to repayment of his/her deposits up to a monetary ceiling of Rs.1,00,000/- (Rupees 
One lakh only) from the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) 
under usual terms and conditions.  
The bank was granted a licence by Reserve Bank of India on November 22, 1986 to 
commence banking business. The statutory inspection of the bank with reference to its 
position as on March 31, 2008 revealed adverse financial position of the bank. 
The subsequent statutory inspection of the bank with respect to its position as on 
March 31, 2009 revealed that its financial position had deteriorated and was precarious. 
Due to precarious financial position and the liquidity crunch faced by the bank, it was 
placed under directions with effect from August 28, 2009 vide Directive UBD.NSB II No. D- 
57/12.21.18/2008-09 dated August 24, 2009. The Reserve Bank of India issued a show 
cause notice to the bank on November 26, 2009 asking it to show cause as to why the 
licence granted to it on November 22, 1986 to conduct banking business should not be 
cancelled. The bankís reply to the show cause notice was examined. The bank stated that 
it was not in a position to make payment to its depositors, either now or in future. No other 
bank came forward to merge this bank with it. The bank did not have a viable plan of action 
for its revival. In the absence of any viable proposal for turnaround and means to achieve 
the required regulatory prescriptions the possibility of revival of the bank was remote. 
Therefore, the Reserve Bank of India took the extreme measure of cancelling licence of the 
bank in the interest of the bank's depositors. With the cancellation of its licence and 
commencement of liquidation proceedings, the process of paying the depositors of The 
Bahadarpur Urban Co-operative Bank Ltd., Bahadarpur (Gujarat) will be set in motion 
subject to the terms and conditions of the Deposit Insurance Scheme.  
Consequent to the cancellation of its licence, The Bahadarpur Urban Co-operative 
Bank Ltd., Bahadarpur (Gujarat) is prohibited from carrying on ëbanking businessí as 
defined in Section 5(b) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (AACS) including acceptance 
and repayment of deposits.

Manager, Urban Banks Department, Reserve Bank of India, Ahmedabad. His contact
