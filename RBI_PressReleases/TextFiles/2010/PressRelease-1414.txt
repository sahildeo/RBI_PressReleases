Sources of Variation in Foreign Exchange  
Reserves in India: April-December 2009-10 
Earlier today, the Reserve Bank of India released the Balance of Payments 
(BoP) data for Q3 of 2009-10 (October-December 2009) on its website 
(www.rbi.org.in). On the basis of these data along with the revised data for earlier 
quarters, this note on sources of variation in foreign exchange reserves during April-
December 2009 has been compiled. 
Sources of Variation in Foreign Exchange Reserves: April-December 2009 
During April-December 2009, there was an accretion to foreign exchange 
reserves mainly on account of valuation gains. Also, inflows under foreign 
investments, Non-Resident Indian deposits and short-term trade credits have 
contributed significantly to the increase in foreign exchange reserves during April-
December 2009. The sources of variation in the foreign exchange reserves are set 
out in Table 1.

On balance of payments basis (i.e., excluding valuation effects), the foreign 
exchange reserves increased by US$ 11,300 million during April-December 2009 as 
against a decline of US$ 20,380 million during April-December 2008. The valuation 
gains, reflecting the depreciation of the US dollar against the major currencies, 
accounted for US$ 20,185 million during April-December 2009 as compared with a 
valuation loss of US$ 33,375 million during April-December 2008. Accordingly, 
valuation gains during April-December 2009 accounted for 64.1 per cent of the total 
increase in foreign exchange reserves.
