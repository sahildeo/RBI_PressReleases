Reserve Bank Cancels the Licence of the  
Belgaum Catholic Co-operative Bank Ltd., Belgaum, Karnataka 
In view of the fact that the Belgaum Catholic Co-operative Bank Ltd., Belgaum 
(Karnataka) had ceased to be solvent, all efforts to revive it in close consultation with 
the Government of Karnataka had failed and the depositors of the bank were being 
inconvenienced by continued uncertainty, the Reserve Bank of India delivered the 
order canceling its licence to the bank after the close of business on                      
August  03, 2010. The Registrar of Co-operative Societies, Karnataka has also been 
requested to issue an order for winding up of the bank and appoint a Liquidator for 
the bank. It may be highlighted that on liquidation every depositor is entitled to 
repayment of his deposits up to a monetary ceiling of Rs.1,00,000/- from the Deposit 
Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC).    
The bank was granted  licence by Reserve Bank of India on December 23, 
1986 to commence banking business. The statutory inspection conducted by 
Reserve Bank with reference to its financial position as on March 31, 2005 revealed 
several disquieting features in the functioning of the bank. The bank was classified 
as Grade IV and was placed under operational instructions banning accepting of 
fresh deposits and premature withdrawal of term deposits, etc. The next inspection 
conducted with reference to position as on March 31, 2006 revealed that the 
financial position continued to deteriorate and the operational instruction issued were 
continued.  
 The next inspection conducted with reference to position as on March 31, 
2007 revealed slight improvement in the financial position. However, the subsequent 
inspections conducted with reference to position as on March 31, 2008 and March 
31, 2009 revealed further deterioration of the financial position.  In view of the severe 
liquidity problem and the deficiencies observed in the functioning of the bank, in 
public interest and in the interest of the depositors to prevent preferential payment 
and to preserve the assets of the bank, the bank was placed under directions under 
Section 35A of the Act vide directive dated March 15, 2010 prohibiting it from 
sanctioning/renewing of loans and advances, making investments, borrowings and 
acceptance of fresh deposits.  A cap of Rs.1000/- per depositor was placed on 
withdrawal of deposits. Subsequently, a show cause notice (SCN) for cancellation of 
licence was issued on March 30, 2010. The reply to the SCN did not furnish any 
viable plan for revival of the bank. The bank also did not submit any viable proposal 
for merger with any other UCB.  
After taking into account the foregoing and after examining all options for its 
revival, the Reserve Bank of India took the extreme measure of canceling the licence 
of the bank in the interest of the bank's depositors.  With the cancellation of its 
licence and commencement of liquidation proceedings, the process of paying the 
depositors of the Belgaum Catholic Co-operative bank Ltd., Belgaum (Karnataka) the 
amount insured as per the DICGC Act will be set in motion.  2
Consequent on cancellation of its licence, Belgaum Catholic Co-operative 
Bank Ltd., Belgaum, (Karnataka) is prohibited from carrying on 'banking business' as 
defined in Section 5(b) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949(AACS) including 
acceptance and repayment of deposits.
