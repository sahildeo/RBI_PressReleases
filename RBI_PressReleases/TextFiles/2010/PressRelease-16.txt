RBI releases 'Quarterly Statistics on Deposits and 
Credit of Scheduled Commercial Banks: June 2010'
 
The Reserve Bank of India today released its 'Quarterly Statistics on Deposits 
and Credit of Scheduled Commercial Banks, June 2010’. The publication contains 
data relating to deposits and credit of scheduled commercial banks including 
regional rural banks (RRBs) as on last Friday of June 2010 (June 25, 2010). The 
data are based on Basic Statistical Return (BSR)-7 giving branch wise data, received 
from all scheduled commercial banks (including RRBs). 
 
The June issue also contains centre-wise outstanding deposit data by type of 
deposit account (current, saving and term) as on March 31, 2009 (Statement 17) 
based on annual BSR-2 return.  Further, with a view to keep consistency in the BSR 
publications, with those in other publications, data for ‘Old’ and ‘New’ private sector 
banks are published separately (Hitherto,  both these bank groups were shown 
together as ‘Other Scheduled Commercial Banks’ (OSCBs) in BSR-7 publication).
