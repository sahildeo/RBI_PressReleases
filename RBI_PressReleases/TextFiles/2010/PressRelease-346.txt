RBI announces Liquidity Easing Measures 
 
 The liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) window of the Reserve Bank has been 
in the deficit mode in the recent period. In order to provide liquidity comfort arising 
out of frictional liquidity pressure, the Reserve Bank has today announced the 
following temporary measures: 
ï A special second LAF (SLAF) will be conducted on two days at       
2.30 p.m. on October 29, 2010 and at 4.15 p.m. on November 1, 2010.  
ï A special 2-day repo auction under the LAF will be conducted at   
10.30 a.m. on Saturday, October 30, 2010. Scheduled commercial 
banks may avail of additional liquidity support under the LAF to the 
extent of up to 1.0 per cent of their net demand and time liabilities 
(NDTL) as on October 8, 2010. For any shortfall in maintenance of 
statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) on October 30-31, 2010 arising out of 
availment of this facility, banks may seek waiver of penal interest 
purely as an ad hoc, temporary measure. This facility will be available 
only on Saturday, October 30, 2010.
