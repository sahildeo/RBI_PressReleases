RBI Releases Gist of Comments on the Discussion Paper on Entry of New 
Banks in the Private Sector 
The Reserve Bank of India released on its website today, the gist of the 
comments on the Discussion Paper on "Entry of New Banks in the Private Sector". 
The range of comments received has been very wide and does not indicate 
consensus on any of the issues. The comments received are reflective of sectoral 
positions, i.e. of banks, NBFCs and industrial houses. Comments from others also 
spanned a wide range. 
It may be recalled that pursuant to the announcement made by the Union 
Finance Minister in his budget speech for the year 2010-11  that the Reserve Bank 
was considering giving some additional banking licences to private sector players, 
the Governor, Reserve Bank of India indicated in the Annual Policy Statement for the 
year 2010-11 that the Reserve Bank would prepare a discussion paper marshalling 
the international practices, the Indian experience as well as the extant ownership 
and governance (O&G) guidelines and place it on the Reserve Bankís website by 
end-July 2010 for wider comments and feedback. Accordingly, the Reserve Bank 
released on its website on August 11, 2010, the Discussion Paper on ìEntry of New 
Banks in the Private Sectorî seeking the views/comments from banks, non-banking 
financial institutions, industrial houses, other institutions and the public at large.   
The Discussion Paper reviewed the international and Indian experience on 
issues listed below together with possible approaches with the pros and cons of 
each of the approaches. 
i) Minimum capital requirements for new banks and promoters contribution 
ii) Minimum and maximum caps on promoter shareholding and other shareholders 
iii) Foreign shareholding in the new banks 
iv) Whether industrial and business houses could be allowed to promote banks  
v) Should Non-Banking Financial Companies be allowed conversion into banks or to 
promote a bank 
vi) Business model for the new banks 
Detailed discussions on the above issues  were held on October 7 and 8, 
2010 with associations of stakeholders from the industry, banks, NBFCs and MFIs 
and some consultants, viz, CII, ASSOCHAM, FICCI, IBA, RRBs Officersí Federation, 
FIDC, MFIN, Ernst & Young, and Pricewaterhouse Coopers. In addition, comments 
on the discussion paper were received from a large number of respondents which 
include parties interested in setting up new banks, industry associations, banks,  2
academicians, eminent personalities associated with banking and finance and 
members of general public.  
Gist of Comments 
The gist of comments on various issues received from important stakeholders 
and eminent people through mail and discussions is summarised below: 
(A)  Minimum capital requirement for new banks 
There were diverse views on the minimum initial capital requirement of new 
banks to be set up in the private sector. Generally, the federations/associations of 
industry/banks favoured a high start-up capital of ` 1000 crore, which could be raised 
up to ` 1500-2000 crore over a period of time, as new banks would require high 
investments in technology for financial inclusion and to scale up operations to be 
viable. Further, higher level of minimum capital would ensure that only serious 
players with long term vision could enter banking sector.  
NBFC/MFI sector preferred a lower start-up capital ranging from ` 300 to `500 
crore. With this capital requirement, it has been argued that 30- 40 banks could be 
licensed within a period of next 5-10 years with dedicated focus on financial 
inclusion. One view was that a large bank with capital of ` 1000 crore was unlikely to 
be effective at local lending or at financial inclusion and therefore, RBI may also 
consider giving restricted (traditional) banking licences to about 20 new banks with 
minimum capital of ` 50 crore and a capital to asset ratio of not less than 15 percent.  
(B)  Promotersí shareholdings in new banks 
The suggestions on initial promotersí contribution ranged from 30 percent to 
100 percent. The federations/associations of industry suggested a range of 40-51 
percent, while NBFC/MFI sector suggested a lower range of 30-40 percent. The 
minimum promotersí contribution to be retained after dilution of stake over a period 
of 5-10 years ranged from 5-26 percent. The industry representatives were of the 
view that strong companies are promoter driven and therefore, advocated a higher 
range of final stake holding of 20-26 percent as it would ensure long term interest 
and commitment of the promoters. There was a suggestion that on the lines of 
Canadian Model, depending upon the size of the bank, promoters should be 
permitted to hold to the extent of 40 percent in case of banks with ` 1000 crore initial 
capital, 30 percent in case of banks with ` 1000-2000 crore capital and 10 -20 
percent in case of banks with capital of more than ` 2000 crore. Another suggestion 
was that promotersí contribution could continue at 40-50 percent with restrictions on 
voting rights to ensure that promotersí economic interest is retained while addressing 
the concerns relating to control. The suggestion from the Micro Finance sector was a 
lower cap of 10 percent on promotersí holding in the long run to ensure that the 
banks are agenda driven rather than individual driven.   
(C) Foreign shareholdings in new banks 
A number of suggestions were received in regard to foreign share holdings 
ranging from capping the shareholdings at 50 percent to have no restrictions at all.  
Even amongst the industry/associations/ banks, while some of them advocated 
putting a cap at 50 percent, others have suggested continuing with the existing norm 
of 74 percent or not having any restriction for the initial period of 10 years. The 
NBFC/MFI sector was of the view that prescribing a cap of 50 percent for banking 
industry will be contradictory since foreign investments in NBFC sector is permitted  3
upto 100 percent.  They were in favour of retaining the existing norm of 74 percent or 
not putting any restrictions at all. 
Another suggestion received from public was to put restriction on the voting 
rights, which should not exceed 5 percent individually and 26 percent in aggregate or 
such other limits as may be prescribed. 
(D) Industrial/business houses promoting new banks 
A wide range of views have been expressed as to whether industrial/business 
houses should be allowed to promote new banks. These include, why they should 
not be given, why they should be given and if so, who should be permitted and with 
what conditions. The federations/associations of industry as well as NBFC/MFI 
sector were generally in favour of permitting industrial/business houses to promote 
new banks. On the other hand, RBI has been advised by others to exercise caution 
about the entry of industrial houses into banking and not to allow industrial houses 
an unrestricted banking licence. Banks were also not in favour of the proposal due to 
the unsavory past experience in India and abroad and that large capital buffer that 
would be available to the banks sponsored by industrial/business houses would 
create an uneven playing field with the existing banks. 
The main arguments put forward were : 
i) Arguments against giving licence to industrial/business houses: 
 
ï Experience of other counties show that combining banking and commerce, 
that is, having a financial licence and having industrial activity, implies there 
would be a lot of connected lending.  India does not have enough experience 
in supervising in a scenario when banks are owned by diversified corporates, 
and allowing such ownership could have serious potential disasters. 
 
ï The ownership structure of large industrial / business groups may open 
opportunities for regulatory arbitrage. In cases where the apex entity of a 
financial conglomerate is an unregulated entity, there could be gaps in risk 
assessment and supervision, and associated contagion risk within the 
financial conglomerate concerned and the wider system. 
 
ï India already has a concentrated wealth structure, which influences political 
decisions. Allowing industrial houses to own banks will exacerbate the 
concentration of economic power and political influence. However, as an 
experiment, a couple of industrial houses could be allowed to own restricted 
small banks and the future moves should be based on this experience. 
 
ï As there is no dearth of capital, existing players also could raise the required 
capital and, as such, no additional benefit accrues by granting bank licences 
to industrial houses.  
 
ii) Arguments in favour of giving licence to industrial/business houses: 
ï Financial inclusion requires higher scale of operations which the industries 
would be able to bring by deploying large capital.  
 
ï Industrial / business houses have the entrepreneurial and managerial talent in 
running asset management companies, mutual funds and insurance 
companies and have successfully penetrated into rural India, as such, their 
talent could be gainfully harnessed in the banking sector. Moreover, industrial 
houses could bring to banking strong governance practices, management  4
expertise, talent, innovation and global best practices especially in customer 
service, as they have had a long history in nurturing and developing 
businesses.  
iii) Eligibility criteria for granting licence to the industrial/business houses: 
ï Industrial / business houses with diversified shareholding and transparent 
shareholding structure should be permitted to set up banks.  
 
ï Industrial / business houses having predominant presence & experience in 
the financial sector (for certain minimum years, say 10 years) could be 
considered granting banking licence after examining their track record of 
dealing with public deposits and considering their existing retail customer 
base.  
 
ï Real estate groups should not be barred from entering into the banking sector 
as other businesses such as steel, textiles, petrochemicals, oil and gas, etc. 
are much more vulnerable to deep and prolonged cyclical downturns than real 
estate. 
iv) Safeguards for allowing industrial/business houses to promote new 
banks: 
ï If industrial / business houses are permitted to promote banks, they should 
not be allowed to have their own banking operations through the bank they 
have promoted.  
 
ï Banks promoted by industrial houses should be issued only a retail banking 
license for first 5 years. Subsequently, commercial banking should be allowed 
with restrictions on annual credit lines, extensive reporting requirements 
relating to large credits, etc.  
 
ï Inherent conflict of interest with the industrial houses setting up banks could 
be addressed through strong regulation relating to connected lending, mutual 
lending to each otherís sponsor groups, ring fencing of the activities, 
governance standards and exposures which could be clearly addressed 
through licensing conditions. Violation of these regulations should attract 
severe penal action, including withdrawal of the bank license. No Board 
member or employee of an industrial house should be allowed to be on the 
Board of the bank or be an employee of the bank. Further, independence of 
the Board of the bank could be ensured by defining independent directors and 
restricting their compensation to only a professional fee.  
ï There may be value in experimenting with the industrial / business houses 
and the dual license structure offers some scope for it. A couple of industrial 
houses with substantial integrity could be given restricted small bank licenses. 
Whether the industrial / business housesí license is upgraded will depend on 
their performance and supervisory comfort with them. Establishing many 
small and mid size banks will help the banks to be innovative in delivering 
local need based services to the low income & poor households. 
(E) Permitting conversion of NBFC into banks or promoting new banks 
There were diverse views on the issue of permitting conversion of NBFCs into 
banks or to promote new banks. A leading industry association was of the view that 
conversion of NBFC should not be permitted due to difficulty in aligning its business 
model to banking. However, if NBFCs are allowed to promote new banks, they  5
should be asked to wind up the activities which banks can do, in a phased manner in 
order to eliminate the arbitrage opportunities due to the lighter regulations in the 
NBFC sector. Other industry associations were generally in favour of conversion or 
promotion of new banks by NBFCs. The NBFC/MFI sector was in favour of both the 
options. Banks were in favour of allowing only stand alone NBFCs to promote banks 
and at the same time, debarring NBFCs sponsored by industrial/business houses. 
(F) Business Model 
The dominant view of the industry associations and banks was that general 
banking licences should be given to new players for ensuring level playing field. 
Concentration in any geographical area or business line, such as, financial inclusion 
would be an unviable proposition. Financial inclusion should be market driven, but 
not prescribed. Since the banks need to cope with the objective of financial inclusion 
and also compliance with CRR, SLR, Priority Sector Advances stipulations, etc., 
certain time period needs to be given to the new banks for achieving the objectives. 
As the objective of granting licence for new banks is financial inclusion, a 
different type of licence could be given to new banks. An eminent economist has 
suggested that their activities in the initial period may be restricted to more traditional 
banking, which could be relaxed as supervisors gained confidence in the banks. Full-
fledged banking licences could be given after three years of operations subject to 
compliance with certain criteria. There are also suggestions that new banks should 
cater to small ticket financial products with clear definition regarding the size of 
loans. However, there is no need for specifying the areas in which the new banks 
should function as there are financially excluded people even in metros and big 
cities.
