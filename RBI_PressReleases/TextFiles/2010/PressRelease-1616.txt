RBI Steps for Infrastructure Finance Companies 
 
The Reserve Bank of India has today issued a notification introducing a new 
category of Non Banking Finance Companies as ìInfrastructure Finance Companies 
(IFCs)î. The existing categories of NBFCs are Asset Finance Companies (AFCs), Loan 
Companies (LCs) and Investment Companies (ICs).  
 
It may be recalled that in paragraph 178 of the Second Quarter Review of 
Monetary Policy 2009-10, announced on October 27, 2009, it was indicated that 
systematically important non deposit taking non banking finance companies engaged 
predominantly in the infrastructure financing had requested that there should be a 
separate category of infrastructure financing NBFCs in view of the critical role played by 
them in providing credit to the infrastructure sector. In another notification issued today 
the Reserve Bank has linked the risk weight of banksí exposure to infrastructure finance 
companies to their credit rating assigned by external credit assessment institutions 
(ECAIs).This is also done in pursuance of the announcement made in paragraph 160 of 
the Second Quarter Review of Monetary Policy 2009-10. 
 
Further with a view to encouraging larger flow of funds to infrastructure, the 
exposure of a bank to infrastructure finance companies has been enhanced up to 20 
per cent of its capital funds.
