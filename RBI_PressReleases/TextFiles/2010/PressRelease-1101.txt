Securitisation Transactions by NBFCs - Draft Guidelines on  
Minimum Holding Period and Minimum Retention Requirement 
 
The Reserve Bank of India today posted on its website the draft guidelines on 
minimum holding period and minimum retention requirement for securitisation 
transactions undertaken by NBFCs. The draft guidelines contain modification of the 
extant guidelines issued on February 01, 2006 and also introduce two new aspects, 
namely, defining a minimum holding period before selling an asset to an Special 
Purpose Vehicle and retention of a minimum portion of the loan prior to 
securitisation. 
 
Adopting a consultative approach, the guidelines have been placed on the 
Reserve Bank's website (www.rbi.org.in) for comments by a wider audience. 
Comments/ suggestions may please be sent by email at the earliest but within 21 
days of hosting of the guidelines, for consideration of the Reserve Bank.
