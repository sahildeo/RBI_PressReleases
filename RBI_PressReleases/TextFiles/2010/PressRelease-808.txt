Macroeconomic and Monetary Developments in the First Quarter of 2010-11 
The Reserve Bank of India today released the document Macroeconomic and 
Monetary Developments: First Quarter Review 2010-11, which serves as a 
background to the First Quarter Review of Monetary Policy 2010-11 to be 
announced on July 27, 2010. 
Overall Assessment 
ï The normalisation of monetary policy of the Reserve Bank in 2010-11 so far 
has been conditioned by the changing growth-inflation dynamics 
characterised by robust acceleration in growth and increasing generalisation 
of inflation. 
 
ï With concerns about the recovery receding, increasing risks of generalised 
inflation indicate that monetary policy has to continue the calibrated 
normalisation process.  
Highlights 
Global Economic Conditions 
ï Global output increased by over 5 per cent in Q1 of 2010 but the global 
economy  has hit a soft patch thereafter due to concerns stemming from the 
sovereign debt situation in the euro area. 
 
ï Emerging Market Economies (EMEs) are expected to continue the process of 
normalisation of monetary policy in view of their stronger recovery, emerging 
inflationary pressures, and risks of asset price build-up. Advanced economies, 
on the other hand, may further delay monetary exit, due to the emergence of 
new risks to recovery, as also their well anchored inflation expectations. 
 
ï Global demand may weaken in the second half of 2010 if the pace of global 
recovery slows down due to possible escalation of the euro area fiscal stress 
and adoption of fiscal austerity measures by the advanced economies. 
 
Indian Economy 
Output 
ï Going by the progress of the monsoon so far, agricultural output is expected 
to be better than last year. Industrial production continues to exhibit double 
digit growth in the current year; notwithstanding some moderation in May 
2010, the downside risks to growth are low. Lead indicators for services 
activities suggest continuation of the growth momentum.  
  2
ï Thus, GDP growth in 2010-11 can be expected to be higher than the 8.0 per 
cent projected in the April 2010 Monetary Policy Statement.  
 
ï The Professional Forecastersí Survey conducted by the Reserve Bank in 
June 2010 places overall (median) GDP growth rate for 2010-11 at 8.4 per 
cent, higher than 8.2 per cent reported in the previous round of the survey. 
Aggregate Demand 
ï Private investment demand recovered sharply in the last quarter of 2009-10. 
Production trends in capital goods point to continuation of the strong 
investment activities in the near-term.  
ï Disaggregated information such as production of consumer durables and non-
durables, auto sales and non-oil imports suggest stronger recovery in private 
consumption demand going forward.  
ï Pick-up in demand for credit from the private sector, rapid growth in corporate 
sales, and information on order books available from forward looking surveys 
indicate strengthening of domestic demand.  
ï Growth in government consumption demand is likely  to moderate, reflecting 
the fiscal consolidation programmed in the Budget.  
ï Overall, private consumption and investment demand will be the two major 
drivers of growth during 2010-11. 
Fiscal Conditions 
ï The fiscal consolidation plans programmed in the Union Budget for 2010-11 
will benefit from the larger than expected mobilisation from 3G/ Broadband 
Wireless Access (BWA) spectrum auctions, which together represent 1 per 
cent point of GDP.  
 
ï The partial deregulation/upward revision to the prices of petroleum products in 
June 2010 will contain pressure on the fiscal situation from under-recoveries 
of the public sector oil companies.  
 
ï While the price adjustment in the petroleum sector may add to headline 
inflation in the near-term, the improved fiscal situation would be congenial to 
both inflation and growth in the medium run. 
External Economy 
ï With recovery in growth of exports and the return of capital flows, external 
sector conditions improved during the course of 2009-10. 
  
ï The current account deficit, however, widened to 2.9 per cent of GDP in 2009-
10, from 2.4 per cent in 2008-09, which contributed to the recovery through 
higher absorption of foreign capital.  
 
ï In 2010-11 so far, import growth has exceeded export growth, reflecting 
stronger growth performance of India relative to the global economy;  capital 
inflows have also moderated, led by the decline in portfolio flows.

Monetary and Liquidity Conditions 
ï The surplus liquidity conditions that prevailed all through 2009-10 started 
moderating in early 2010-11 in response to the calibrated normalisation of 
monetary policy by the Reserve Bank. 
 
ï In June 2010, however, there was  severe tightness in liquidity conditions 
resulting from a sudden and sharp increase in the government cash balances 
stemming from significantly higher mobilisation under 3G/BWA spectrum 
auctions.  
 
ï While mitigating the liquidity pressure, the Reserve Bank persevered with 
calibrated monetary tightening keeping in view the higher level of inflation.  
 
ï Reflecting increased demand for credit associated with recovery in growth, 
non-food credit growth to the private sector remained buoyant. 
Financial Markets 
ï In the first quarter of 2010-11, the volatility in global markets emanating from 
concerns about fiscal sustainability in the euro area, spilled over to the Indian 
markets, particularly the equity market. 
 
ï Reflecting the tight liquidity conditions in June 2010, interest rates at the short 
end of the term structure edged up, while medium to long-term yields 
moderated, in view of the improved fiscal position after 3G/BWA auction 
revenues.  
 
ï The banking sector switched over to a new ìbase rateî system of lending 
effective July 1, 2010, which is expected to enhance transparency in loan 
pricing, promote competition in the credit market and also improve the 
transmission of monetary policy. The base rates set by major public sector 
banks were in the narrow range of 7.25-8.0 per cent.  
Inflation Situation 
ï Headline WPI inflation has been in double digits since February 2010 and   
has also become increasingly generalised in every successive month.  
 
ï Non-food manufacturing inflation accelerated from near zero in November 
2009 to 7.3 per cent in June 2010, reflecting the impact of rising input costs, 
recovering private demand and associated return of pricing power. 
 
ï Since November 2009, 42 per cent of the overall increase in WPI has resulted 
from revisions in administered prices and lagged reporting of past increases in 
prices.   
 
ï Given the risks to inclusive growth from high inflation, the monetary unwinding 
that started in October 2009 should continue till inflation expectations are 
firmly anchored and inflation is brought down.
