FM lays Foundation Stone for Bank Note Paper Mill at Mysore 
 
“Currency continues to be a dominant means of payment in the country’s 
economy. The ratio of currency to GDP which was 12 per cent in 1951 is currently 
around 13 percent currently. For a vast and growing country like India, indigenisation 
of the process of manufacture of currency notes including its various inputs like 
paper, ink, etc., is of strategic importance.  Besides, it will also give the benefits of 
backward integration in the form of assured, smooth and timely supplies, cost 
savings, security and generation of employment, etc. As a significant milestone in 
the indigenisation process, Shri Pranab Mukherjee, Hon’ble Minister of Finance, 
Government of India laid the foundation stone of a new banknote paper mill at 
Mysore this afternoon, in the premises of the Bharatiya Reserve Bank Note Mudran 
Pvt. Ltd. (BRBNMPL), where the mill will be located.  
 
The Reserve Bank of India Governor, Dr. D. Subbarao, Deputy Governor Smt. 
Usha Thorat, who is also the Chairperson of BRBNMPL, CMD, Security Printing and 
Minting Corporation of India Ltd, Shri M.S. Rana, MD, BRBNMPL Shri S.C.Agrawal,  
Member of Parliament, Shri A H Viswanath and  Shri Dhruv Narayana  and  
Members of Legislature Assembly and Mayor of Mysore Shri. Purushotham   
attended the ceremony.  
 
The banknote paper mill is a joint venture between the BRBNMPL, the note 
printing unit of the Reserve Bank of India and the SPMCIL, a Government of India 
Undertaking - the two agencies which are collectively responsible for printing of all 
currency notes in the country. This plant, located in close proximity of the note 
printing press in Mysore, will suitably have production capacity of 6000 metric tonnes 
with an additional line of equal capacity to be installed in the second phase.   
 
“I congratulate MOF and the RBI for having conceptualised the architecture of 
this project and put the implementation thereof on a fast track in a relatively short 
period of time. Indigenisation of bank note paper manufacturing will provide the 
benefits of backward integration in the form of assured, smooth & timely supplies, 
cost savings, employment generation and effective deterrent to counterfeiting. Hence 
this project is of great strategic consequence and we must remain resolutely 
committed to its success” the Finance Minister said in his speech.  
 
In his remarks, the Governor Dr. D. Subbarao traced the history of paper 
currency in India and outlined the significance and the need for the paper mill.  He  2
stated that it was Reserve Bank of India’s responsibility as the sole issuer of notes, 
to make available to the public good and clean notes in adequate quantity. 
 
In 2008-09, the Reserve Bank got 15 billion notes printed through the four 
printing presses. In the current year, it has indented for about 17 billion notes 
requiring approximately 18000 MT of banknote paper. The requirement of notes and 
the demand for paper is expected to go up further in the near future. “We are the 
second largest country in the world in terms of number of notes printed,” he pointed 
out and added that the entire quantity of currency notes needed is printed within the 
country. However, insofar as the paper requirement for note printing is concerned, 
India produces (through Hoshangabad Security Paper Mill) hardly 5 per cent of the 
paper required for currency notes printing. For the balance 95 per cent requirement, 
India relies on imports. “We need to alter this position. This plant in Mysore will be a  
state of the art production unit  that will showcase to the world  India’s capacity to 
produce Bank Note Paper conforming  to the best international quality and security 
standards  ” the Governor said .   
 
Background 
• Since the time the Reserve Bank was established, the value of notes in 
circulation in the country has increased from about Rs. 172 crore in 1935 to 
more than Rs.7,00,000 crore  in 2009.  
• In terms of volume, notes in circulation have increased from 124 million 
pieces in 1935 to more than 51 billion pieces in September 2009.  
• Currently there are four printing presses – two owned by the Government of 
India and located at Nashik, Maharashtra (established in 1928) and another at 
Dewas, M.P (1975), and two owned by the Reserve Bank - at Mysore, 
Karnataka (1996) and Salboni, West Bengal (1996). In 2008-09, more than 15 
billion notes were printed by these four presses and in the current year, it is 
likely to go up to about 17 billion notes. With this magnitude, India is the 
second largest country in the world in terms of notes printed.  
• India produces only 5 per cent of the paper required annually for currency 
note printing.  
• Presently, the annual requirement of paper for banknotes is around 18,000 
Tonnes.  
• After China, India is the largest producer and consumer of currency notes. 
• Major countries viz. USA, Japan, China, Brazil, Russia and countries in the 
European Union, and even small countries like, South Korea, Indonesia, Iran 
and Pakistan,  make their own currency note paper.
