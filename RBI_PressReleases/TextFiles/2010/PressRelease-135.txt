Highlights of special articles: 
1. Quarterly Industrial Outlook Survey: July-September 2010 (51st Round)  
The article presents the findings of Industrial Outlook Survey conducted for 
st
July- September 2010 quarter, the 51 round in the series. It gives the 
assessment of business situation of companies in manufacturing sector, for the 
quarter July-September 2010, and their expectations for the ensuing quarter October-
December 2010. 
Main Findings 
ï The survey results signal that the Indian manufacturing sector took further 
steps to recovery pointing towards economic growth.  
ï Production and new business continued to grow significantly reflecting in the 
increase in work-force.  
ï The input price pressure eased noticeably and the manufacturers exhibited 
more optimism in their profits.  
ï The Business Expectation Index, which acts as a barometer of the overall 
health of the sector, posted 119.0 for the assessment quarter and 126.5 for the 
ensuing quarter - the highest reading since AprilñJune 2007 quarter. 
 
st
2. Inflation Expectations Survey of Households - September 2010 (21 Round)  
The article presents the findings of Inflation Expectations Survey of 
st
Households for July-September 2010 quarter, the 21 round in the series. The 
survey sheds light on the inflation expectations of 4000 households across 12 cities 
for the next quarter (Octoberñ December 2010) and for the next year (October 2010- 
September 2011). The survey captures the expectations of inflation for a 
respondentís own basket of consumption. Therefore, the inflation rates from this 
survey represent the inflation expectations of 4000 urban households based on their 
individual consumption baskets and, hence, these rates are not to be considered as 
predictors of any official measure of inflation.  
Main Findings 
ï The householdsí inflation expectations provide useful directional information 
on near-term inflationary pressures and also complement other economic 
indicators, to get a better idea of future inflation.   2
ï The survey findings portray that households expect inflation to rise further by 
20 and 60 basis points during the next quarter (to 12.3 per cent) and the next 
year (to 12.7 per cent), respectively, from the perceived current rate of 12.1 
per cent.  
ï Householdsí expectations of general price rise was mainly influenced by 
movements in prices of food products. More respondents expected price rise 
in food, housing and non-food products compared to other product groups.  
ï Housewives and daily-wage workers expected higher inflation rates compared 
to other categories. Higher inflation expectations persisted in Bangalore and 
Lucknow. 
  
3. Report of the Working Group on Balance of Payments Manual for India 
The Working Group on Balance of Payments Manual for India (Chairman: 
Shri Deepak Mohanty) was constituted to examine the current practices, 
procedures of compilation, presentation, coverage and sources of Indiaís 
balance of payments statistics in relation to international best practices and 
also to bring out a comprehensive Balance of Payments Manual for India. The 
Group has submitted its Report to Deputy Governor, Dr. Subir Gokarn on October 
13, 2010.  
The Report has two parts. Part I discusses various issues relating to India's 
Balance of Payments statistics and makes a number of suggestions to improve 
compilation, coverage and presentation of Indiaís balance of payments (BoP) 
consistent with international best practices. Part II presents the revised Balance of 
Payments Manual for India, drawing from the international best practices as 
suggested by the IMFís BoP Manual. Besides discussing the concepts and 
documenting the compilation methods pertaining to various accounts of the BoP, the 
Manual has made a detailed assessment of the current practices of compilation, data 
sources and presentation of BoP in India against the backdrop of the significant 
changes introduced by the IMFís latest Manual (BPM6). The Report can be 
accessed at www.rbi.org.in  
4. Central Government Finances: April-September 2010 
The article reviews the finances of the Central Government during the 
first half of 2010-11,  as released by the Controller General of Accounts in 
October 2010.  This article covers the details of the receipts and expenditures of the 
Central Government during the period under review. 
Main Findings  
ï Central Government finances during the first half of the current fiscal year 
show that Government is well within its target to meet its budgeted deficit 
indicators.  
ï The key deficit indicators, viz., gross fiscal deficit, revenue deficit and primary 
deficit, were found to be substantially lower during April-September 2010 than 
the corresponding period of previous year.  
ï As a proportion of their respective budget estimates, the levels were much 
lower in the first half of current fiscal year than that of the previous year. 
Revenue receipts increased substantially during the first half of 2010-11 on 
account of surge in non-tax revenue and rebound in tax revenue.  
ï While continued economic recovery and reversal of tax rate contributed to 
higher tax receipts, the mobilisation of revenues from 3G spectrum and 
broadband wireless access (BWA) auctions helped to ease the pressure on 
Government finances.   3
ï The lower growth in aggregate expenditure reflects deceleration in non-Plan 
expenditure during the first half of 2010-11. 
ï In the remaining part of the year, developments with regard to the progress in 
disinvestment, the likely impact of economic growth on tax revenues and cash 
outgo on account of supplementary demand for grants may have implications 
for overall Central Government finances. 
 
5. Indiaís Foreign Trade: 2010-11 (April-September)   
The  article  reviews the performance of Indiaís merchandise trade during 
2010-11 (April-September) on the basis of data released by the Ministry of 
Commerce and Industry and Directorate General of Commercial Intelligence 
and Statistics (DGCI&S). The article also covers disaggregated commodity-wise 
and direction-wise analysis of Indiaís trade during the period 2010-11 (April-June). 
Main Findings 
ï The article observes that during 2010-11 (April-September), Indiaís 
merchandise exports at US$ 103.6 billion posted a growth of 28.0 per cent 
over the corresponding period of previous year as against a decline of 25.7 
per cent during 2009-10 (April-September). 
ï  Merchandise imports at US$ 166.5 billion registered a rise of 29.9 per cent as 
against a decline of 30.7 per cent during 2009-10 (April-September).  
ï The exports maintained the growth momentum while the imports showed a 
slight deceleration in comparison to growth in previous months.  
ï The oil and non-oil imports registered growth rates of 30.0 per cent and 29.9 
per cent in 2010-11 (April-September) as against declines of 40.8 per cent 
and 25.5 per cent, respectively, during 2009-10 (April-September).  
ï Further, the disaggregated data on commodity-wise merchandise trade as 
well as source and direction of exports and imports reveal that trade of all 
major commodity groups (viz., primary products, manufactured goods, 
petroleum products and bulk and non-bulk import items) and with major 
trading partners (viz., OECD, OPEC, Eastern Europe and Developing 
Countries) registered a rise during 2010-11 (April-June) over the 
corresponding period of previous year.
