Reserve Bank Cancels the Licence of Shri Mahesh Sahakari Bank Ltd., 
Jalgaon, Maharashtra  
In view of the fact that Shri Mahesh Sahakari Bank Ltd., Jalgaon, Maharashtra 
had ceased to be solvent, all efforts to revive it in close consultation with the 
Government of Maharashtra had failed and the depositors were being 
inconvenienced by continued uncertainty, the Reserve Bank of India delivered the 
order cancelling its licence to the bank after the close of business on March 19, 
2010. The Registrar of Co-operative Societies, Maharashtra has also been 
requested to issue an order for winding up the bank and appoint a liquidator for the 
bank. It may be highlighted that on liquidation, every depositor is entitled to 
repayment of his/her deposits up to a monetary ceiling of Rs. 1,00,000/- (Rupees 
One lakh only) from the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation 
(DICGC) under usual terms and conditions.  
The bank was granted a licence to function as a co-operative bank by 
Reserve Bank on November 16, 1999. The inspection of the bank with reference to 
its position as on March 31, 2008 revealed that the bankís position had deteriorated.  
The statutory inspection of the bank with reference to its position as on March 
31, 2009 revealed that the financial position had further worsened and turned 
precarious. Reserve Bank of India therefore issued directions under Section 35 A of 
the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (As applicable to Co-operative Societies) vide 
Directive UBD.CO.NSB-I.No.D-71/12.22.469/2009-10 dated October 5, 2009 
restricting its operations.  
The Reserve Bank of India issued a notice to the bank on November 4, 2009 
asking it to show cause as to why the licence granted to it to conduct banking 
business should not be cancelled. The reply to the show cause notice was examined 
and it was observed that the bank did not have any viable plan of action for its 
revival. The financial projections made by the bank were found to be not sufficient to 
revive and sustain its operations. The bank had also failed to submit any concrete 
proposal for its merger. 
In the absence of any viable proposal for turning around and achieving the 
required regulatory prescriptions, the possibility of revival of the bank was remote. 
Therefore, the Reserve Bank of India took the extreme measure of cancelling licence 
of the bank in the interest of the bank's depositors. With the cancellation of its licence 
and commencement of liquidation proceedings, the process of paying the depositors 
of Shri Mahesh Sahakari Bank Limited, Jalgaon, Maharashtra will be set in motion 
subject to the terms and conditions of the Deposit Insurance Scheme.   2
Consequent to the cancellation of its licence, Shri Mahesh Sahakari Bank 
Limited, Jalgaon, Maharashtra is prohibited from carrying on ëbanking businessí as 
defined in Section 5(b) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (AACS) including 
acceptance and repayment of deposits.  
For any clarifications, depositors may approach Shri P.K.Arora, Deputy 
General Manager, Urban Banks Department, Reserve Bank of India, Mumbai. His
