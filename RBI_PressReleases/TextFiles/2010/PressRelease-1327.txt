RBI invites comments on proposals regarding Minimum Holding Period and 
Minimum Retention Requirement for loans originated for securitisation 
The Reserve Bank of India has, today placed on its website, a Discussion 
Paper on ëEmerging Trends in Regulation and Supervision of Securitisation Activities 
of Banksí. The Discussion Paper seeks to provide an update of the ongoing 
international work in regard to minimum holding period and minimum retention 
requirement for loans originated for securitisation,   the rationale behind differing 
opinions and set the background for proposals regarding minimum Lock-in 
Period/Minimum Holding Period (MHP) and Minimum Retention Requirements for 
Indian banks.  
The Paper is divided into three Sections. Section I discusses the issues and 
proposals relating to Lock-in Period/Minimum Holding Period (MHP). Section II is 
devoted to the issues surrounding Minimum Retention Requirement (MRR) and 
related proposals. Section III outlines the modifications to existing guidelines 
proposed to be issued for banks operating in India.  
It may be recalled that in the Second Quarter Review of the Monetary Policy 
announced by Reserve Bank of India on October 27, 2009, it was indicated that RBI 
will issue detailed guidelines regarding lock-in-period and other operational details 
keeping in view the international norms being developed.  
Draft Guidelines proposed to be issued to banks in the matter are also 
annexed.  
Comments on the Discussion Paper as well as Draft Guidelines may please 
be emailed by May 10,  2010 and  also  sent by post / courier to the Chief General
