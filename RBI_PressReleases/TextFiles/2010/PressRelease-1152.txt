Doha Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations:  
Critical Issues in Trade Development pertaining to India 
The Reserve Bank of India today published its Staff Study entitled ëDoha 
Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations: Critical Issues in Trade Development 
pertaining to Indiaí. The Staff Study, authored by Ms. Monika Kathuria, examines the 
major issues that are delaying the conclusion of Doha Round and the dissenting 
views of WTO member countries, in particular of India, on those issues.  
Each member country of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) has to ensure 
that its domestic policies are framed in conformity with the agreements it has signed 
and the commitments it has made in the WTO. It is, therefore, necessary to 
understand the implications and complexities of the agenda issues before signing 
the agreements. The present study provides general understanding of the 
functioning of the WTO and the critical issues involved in Doha Round of 
negotiations. In this context, the study is relevant for policy makers, researchers, 
academicians and general public.    
The study presents a theoretical rationale behind the establishment of a rule-
based multilateral trading system that aims at creating an environment where 
international trade can be carried out as freely and fairly as possible. This is followed 
by a snapshot of the evolution and structure of the WTO along with a brief 
description of its functions and various rounds of trade negotiations held under GATT 
and WTO. 
The primary focus of the study is on Doha Round, which signalled a 
significant policy shift in WTO, drawing attention to the special needs and interests of 
developing member countries, particularly the least developed ones. This round was 
expected to play a developmental role for these member countries. However, it has 
already taken more than eight years and has faced stiff resistance from developing 
member countries. The study analyses the reasons for this and states that 
weaknesses, such as, unbalanced bargaining power, lack of technical expertise in 
developing countries, frequent changes in representator, hamper the negotiations at 
WTO.  
Arguing that efforts should be aimed to conclude the Doha Round as early as 
possible and that it should not be at the expense of the development aspect, the 
study recommends the following policy stance: 
ï In case of agricultural subsidies, the developed countries should be made to 
undertake the commitment of reduction in their bound per capita overall trade-
distorting domestic support(OTDS) instead of total OTDS as per capita OTDS 2 
 
can be used as a measure to converge subsidy provisions prevailing in 
developed and developing countries. Convergence of the two implies effective 
reduction in subsidies provisions. 
 
ï So far as food security and livelihood of poor farmers is concerned, India 
should not compromise on special safeguard measures (SSM), at least, so 
long as the provision of special safeguard for agriculture remains available to 
developed countries. 
 
ï For industrial sector, developed countries should be asked to reduce their 
maximum allowable level of tariff rates to negligible levels, at least for the tariff 
lines covering 98 per cent of potential exports of developing countries in order 
to provide effective market access for developing countriesí exports.  
Developing countries should be provided concession in this respect given 
their lower levels of development. 
 
ï For services, developed and developing countries both should make 
commitments to open up their markets for cross border supplies, for 
consumption abroad, for commercial presence abroad and for movement of 
natural persons.  India has to maintain its demand for greater and effective 
market access for movement of natural persons. 
 
ï Developing countries should be given policy space for growth enhancing 
investment projects and plans as investment policy can help in achieving long 
term development goals. 
 
ï The technology transfers from developed to developing countries should be 
encouraged at the WTO level.  Developing countries should be given access 
to inventions and innovations of developed countries in different areas.  A 
provision could be made at the WTO level for promoting research and 
development in areas characterised by low productivity in developing 
countries.
