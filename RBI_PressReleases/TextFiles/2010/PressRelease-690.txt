RBI releases Winter 2009 issue of its Occasional Papers 
  
The Reserve Bank of India today released the Winter 2009 issue of the 
Reserve Bank of India Occasional Papers. Occasional Papers is a research journal 
of the Reserve Bank and contains contributions of its staff and reflects the views of 
the authors. These issues are woven around some important themes which are in 
the forefront of policy discussions. These issues also contain special notes and book 
reviews.  
  
In this issue, the paper titled ‘International Monetary Fund and Civil Society 
Organisations: A Dialogue’ by Jaya Mohanty highlights the relationship of the 
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Civil Society Organisations (CSOs). The 
International Monetary Fund, an exclusive club of central bankers and government 
officials, became an object of increasing public scrutiny in the 1990s in the aftermath 
of the Asian crisis. The recent economic crisis has reiterated its role in the global 
economic scenario with an almost threefold increase of its resources. Its policies too 
seem to have become tailored to meet the economic requirements of the countries 
seeking recourse. An effort has been made for the first time by the IMF to seek the 
views of   CSOs on governance issues. The process has been termed the 'Fourth 
Pillar', with inputs to the other three pillars being (i) governance of IMF submitted by 
the IEO in May 2008, (ii) report of the working group on IMF corporate governance, 
and (iii) the committee of eminent persons on IMF governance reform. But the very 
nature of the two entities sets the perimeter of their engagement. Notwithstanding 
this limitation, an ongoing engagement is essential to facilitate the transition of world 
economies into a new and higher growth path.  
  
The paper on ‘External Sector Openness and Purchasing Power Parity in 
India: An Annotation’ is by Sunil Kumar and S. M. Lokare. Exchange rate models in 
literature assume that purchasing power parity (PPP) holds in open market 
economies. PPP condition not only helps understand the nature of nominal and real 
shocks in the exchange rate models but also helps policy makers and researchers to 
compute real exchange rate (RER) misalignment.   The main objective of this paper 
is to examine the validity of PPP condition in the case of India during pre and post 
reform periods using monthly data from 1970 to 2009. The results show that real 
exchange rate (RER) series which remain non-stationary in the pre-reform period  
turn out to be stationary during the post reform period reinforcing the validity of  PPP 
in the post reform period, albeit, over the long run. This lends credence to the 
fundamental principle that the chances of holding PPP condition improve in an 
economy with greater external sector openness and integration and a market 
determined exchange rate.

The paper ‘Foreign Portfolio Flows and their Impact on Financial Markets in 
India’ by Saurabh Ghosh and Snehal Herwadkar in the Special Notes Section 
analyses the effect of portfolio flows on various segments of the Indian financial 
markets over the decade preceding global financial crisis. The results of the tests 
suggest that portfolio flows cause changes in equity prices as well as exchange 
rates. In the short run, a positive shock to net FII flow generally result in an increase 
in equity prices, exchange rate (INR/USD) appreciation and a decline in interest 
rates. The magnitude of these responses dampens over time and converges towards 
an equilibrium path. The magnitude and direction of long term coefficients generally 
support the short run findings. The negative and significant error correction term, on 
the other hand, indicates movements towards long run equilibrium and the resilience 
of Indian financial markets. 
 
The second paper in this section titled ‘Trade Pattern in SAARC Countries: Emerging 
Trends and Issues’ by Rajeev Jain and J. B. Singh focusses on the analysis of South 
Asia Association for Regional Co-operation (SAARC) trade. The paper attempts to 
analyse the merchandise trade performance of the SAARC region and also the trend 
in intra-SAARC trade. A brief analysis of trade baskets of SAARC countries (India, 
Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka), shows that export baskets of major SAARC 
countries are significantly similar. This reflects that they may be competing with one 
another in the international market. However, export baskets are relatively more 
diversified for India and Pakistan. The Grubel-Lloyd index provides empirical 
evidence of growing intra-industry trade in SAARC countries which perhaps is an off-
shoot of the trade and industry reforms that have taken place in recent years. An 
attempt is also made to examine SAARC region’s relative competitiveness by 
calculating the revealed comparative advantage index and comparing the structure 
of specialisation using relative trade comparative advantage (RTA) index. It is found 
that India has relative comparative advantage in a larger number of industry groups 
than other SAARC countries and that all major SAARC countries have Relative 
Trade Advantage in the textile sector.  The paper underlines that despite significant 
business cycle convergence in major SAARC countries, trade integration is growing 
only at a slow pace.
