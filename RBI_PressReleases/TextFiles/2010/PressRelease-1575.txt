Reserve Bank Cancels the Licence of Ichalkaranji Urban  
Co-operative Bank Ltd., Ichalkaranji, Kolhapur, Maharashtra 
In view of the fact that Ichalkaranji Urban Co-operative Bank Ltd., Ichalkaranji, 
Kolhapur, Maharashtra had ceased to be solvent, all efforts to revive it in close 
consultation with the Government of Maharashtra had failed and the depositors were 
being inconvenienced by continued uncertainty, the Reserve Bank of India delivered 
the order cancelling its licence to the bank after the close of business on February 
11, 2010. The Registrar of Co-operative Societies, Maharashtra has also been 
requested to issue an order for winding up the bank and appoint a liquidator for the 
bank. It may be highlighted that on liquidation, every depositor is entitled to 
repayment of his/her deposits up to a monetary ceiling of Rs.1,00,000/- (Rupees 
One lakh only) from the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation 
(DICGC) under usual terms and conditions.  
The bank was granted a licence to function as a co-operative bank by 
Reserve Bank on October 31, 1987.  The statutory inspection of the bank with 
respect to its position as on March 31,2006 had indicated that its financial position 
was impaired. The subsequent inspection of the bank with reference to its position 
as on March 31, 2007 revealed that the bankís position had worsened. 
The statutory inspection of the bank with reference to its position as on March 
31, 2008 revealed that the financial position had further deteriorated.  On account of 
reports of liquidity problems, a scrutiny of the books of accounts of the bank was 
conducted on April 15, 2009 and it was revealed that the bank's financial position 
was precarious. Reserve Bank of India therefore issued directions under Section 35 
A of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (As applicable to Co-operative Societies) vide 
Directive UBD.CO.NSB.No.D-38/12.22.082/2009-10 dated April 20, 2009 restricting 
its operations. The subsequent inspection of the bank with reference to the financial 
position as on March 31, 2009 revealed that its financial position had further 
deteriorated.  
The Reserve Bank of India issued a notice to the bank on October 30, 2009 
asking it to show cause as to why the licence granted to it to conduct banking 
business should not be cancelled. The reply to the show cause notice was examined 
and it was observed that the bank did not have any viable plan of action for its 
revival. The bank had also failed to submit any concrete proposal for its merger. 
In the absence of any viable proposal for turning around and achieving the 
required regulatory prescriptions, the possibility of revival of the bank was remote. 
Therefore, the Reserve Bank of India took the extreme measure of cancelling licence 
of the bank in the interest of the bank's depositors. With the cancellation of its licence 
and commencement of liquidation proceedings, the process of paying the depositors 2 
 
of Ichalkaranji Urban Co-operative Bank Ltd., Ichalkaranji, Kolhapur, Maharashtra   
will be set in motion subject to the terms and conditions of the Deposit Insurance 
Scheme.   
 Consequent to the cancellation of its licence, Ichalkaranji Urban Co-operative 
Bank Ltd., Ichalkaranji, Kolhapur, Maharashtra   is prohibited from carrying on 
ëbanking businessí as defined in Section 5(b) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 
(AACS) including acceptance and repayment of deposits.

General Manager, Urban Banks Department, Reserve Bank of India, Mumbai. His
