Macroeconomic and Monetary Developments in the Second Quarter of 2010-11 
 The Reserve Bank of India today released its Macroeconomic and Monetary 
Developments: Second Quarter Review 2010-11 document.The document serves as 
a background to the Second Quarter Review of Monetary Policy 2010-11 to be 
announced on November 02, 2010. 
Overall Assessment 
ï The uncertain global outlook, and the dominance of supply rigidities in certain 
sectors that impart rigidity to the inflation path, pose greater challenge for 
monetary policy in its objective of anchoring inflationary expectations without 
hurting growth.  
Highlights 
Global Economic Conditions 
ï The momentum of global recovery, which exceeded expectations in the first 
half of 2010, has slowed down in the last few months.  According to IMF 
projections, the temporary slowdown in the pace of global growth in the 
second half of 2010 could extend up to the first half of 2011. 
ï In advanced economies, the weakening of recovery has raised concerns 
about both unemployment and deflation. With capacity for fiscal stimulus 
already stretched and given the concerns about sovereign debt, further 
quantitative easing seems the preferred option to address the weakness in 
growth.  
ï The persisting output gap could tempt advanced economies to resort to 
protectionist measures along with preference for undervalued exchange rates, 
and that could pose downside risks to global recovery.  
ï EMEs, which had led the global recovery, continue to exhibit strong growth 
momentum. Notwithstanding some likely moderation in the momentum in the 
second half of the year, the growth imbalance relative to advanced economies 
is expected to persist.   
Indian Economy 
Output 
ï The sharp and broad-based recovery of the Indian economy, which started in 
the second half of 2009-10 continued through Q1 of 2010-11, leading to 
further consolidation of growth around the trend.  
ï A normal monsoon, following a severely deficient monsoon last year, is 
expected to lift the agriculture sector growth to above the trend rate of growth 
in 2010-11.   2
ï Industrial production showed robust growth though with wide volatility around 
the trend.  The core infrastructure sector continues to lag behind the pace of 
growth in industrial production. 
ï Lead indicators of services activities suggest continuation of the momentum.   
ï The current data on indicators of economic performance remain consistent 
with the 8.5 per cent growth projected in the July 2010 Monetary Policy 
Statement.  
Aggregate Demand 
ï Given the weakening external demand conditions and the need for fiscal 
consolidation, sustained growth will hinge increasingly on private consumption 
and investment demand.  
ï Trends in production of capital goods, capital expenditure plans of corporates, 
non-oil imports and growth in credit as well as financing from non-banking 
sources during 2010-11 so far suggest strong conditions for investment 
activities.  
ï Private consumption expenditure data for the first quarter of 2010-11 and the 
trends in corporate sales as well as production of consumer durables point to 
a pick up.   
ï Both the revenue deficit and fiscal deficit, as percentage of GDP, have been 
lower this year so far relative to the corresponding period of last year. There 
has, however, been higher growth in both revenue and capital expenditure 
this year. These provide demand support to the growth process.  
ï Contribution of net exports to growth on the expenditure side of GDP was 
negative in the first quarter of 2010-11. The trend is expected to continue 
during the rest of the year.  
External Sector 
ï The current account deficit in balance of payments widened in the first quarter 
of 2010-11 due to higher trade deficit and moderation in the surplus in the 
invisibles account.  
ï Capital inflows, led by FII flows in recent months, have met the financing 
needs of the current account deficit.  
ï The current account deficit, as percentage of GDP, could be expected to be 
higher in 2010-11 than 2.9 per cent recorded in 2009-10. 
ï While the deficit may be fully financed by capital inflows, the potential volatility 
in such flows poses some risk. 
ï The Indian rupee has appreciated on the basis of 6-currency real effective 
exchange rate (REER) during the year so far, over and above the significant 
appreciation last year. The 36 currency REER remained largely stable.  
ï The higher inflation differential between India and major trading partners is a 
source of pressure on the competitiveness of Indian exports. Containing 
inflation, thus, is important even for improving the external balance position.  
ï The foreign exchange reserves stood at US$ 295.4 billion as on October 22, 
2010. 
Monetary and Liquidity Conditions 
ï Liquidity conditions became tight in the month of May 2010 consequent to the 
transfer of liquidity from the markets to the Government in the wake of the  3
3G/BWA auctions. Since then, liquidity conditions have generally remained in 
deficit mode, consistence with the monetary policy stance of the Reserve 
Bank.   
ï To ease excessive frictional liquidity pressure around the end of October 
2010, the Reserve Bank provided temporary liquidity comfort to the market.  
ï Policy interest rates have been raised five times since the beginning of March 
2010, raising the repo rate by 125 basis points and the reverse repo rate by 
175 basis points.   
ï This asymmetric tightening narrowed the policy corridor from 150 basis points 
to 100 basis points.  With repo replacing reverse repo as the operative rate in 
the LAF, the effective policy interest rate has increased by 275 basis points 
since March 2010.  
ï Broad money (M ) continues to exhibit subdued growth largely due to the 
3
deceleration in the growth of long-term deposits.  
ï With non-food credit growth converging to the 20 per cent growth trajectory 
indicated in the First Quarter Review of Monetary Policy, banks have scaled 
up their deposit mobilisation efforts as evident from the higher deposit rates 
being offered since July 2010.   
Financial Markets 
ï In the global financial markets, concerns about sovereign defaults eased, but 
they were replaced by concerns about risks stemming from the slowdown in 
global recovery.  
ï The multi-speed recovery around the world and the consequent differential 
exit from the accommodative monetary stance have strengthened both the 
push and pull content underlying the significant pick up in private capital flows 
to EMEs.  
ï In the Indian financial markets, the impact of this trend has been visible in the 
appreciation of the exchange rate of the rupee against the US dollar and the 
bullish spikes in equity prices. Housing prices in major cities generally 
increased.  
ï The transmission of higher policy interest rates and deficit liquidity conditions 
strengthened across different segments of the financial markets.  
Inflation 
ï The headline inflation has started to soften after staying in double digit for five 
months up to July 2010. 
ï Inflation in non-food manufactured products, though remains above its 
medium-term trend, has shown some moderation.  
ï But food inflation remains disconcertingly high despite a normal monsoon. 
This can be attributed partly to a change in the consumption pattern in favour 
of protein-rich items, such as, egg, milk, fish and meat where price increases 
have been high.    
ï Despite moderation in recent months, elevated inflation remains a challenge 
for monetary policy.
