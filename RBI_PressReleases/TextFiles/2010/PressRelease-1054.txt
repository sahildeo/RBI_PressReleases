RBI Bulletin ñ June 2010 
Foreign Trade Data analysed; Time-series data on G-sec Yields 
 
The Reserve Bank of India today published June 2010 issue of its monthly 
RBI Bulletin.  Apart from the regular features, such as, speeches of top executives, 
RBI press releases, regulatory and other measures, foreign exchange developments 
and current statistics, the June issue of the RBI bulletin carries an article titled 
Foreign Trade: 2009-10 (April-March). The article reviews Indiaís merchandise trade 
performance during financial year 2009-10 on the basis of data released by the 
Ministry of Commerce and Industry and Directorate General of Commercial 
Intelligence and Statistics (DGCI&S). The article also covers disaggregated 
commodity-wise and direction-wise analysis of Indiaís trade during the period April-
October 2009.  
 
The article observes that during 2009-10, Indiaís merchandise exports at US$ 
176.6 billion posted a decline of 4.7 per cent over the year as against a growth of 
13.7 per cent during 2008-09. Merchandise imports at US$ 278.7 billion recorded a 
decline of 8.2 per cent over the year as against a growth of 20.8 per cent during 
2008-09. The oil and non-oil imports of India also registered a decline of 8.7 per cent 
and 8.0 per cent in 2009-10, respectively, as against a growth of 17.6 per cent and 
22.3 per cent in 2008-09. Further, the disaggregated commodity level and direction 
level data reveals that trade of all major commodity groups (namely, primary 
products, manufactured goods, petroleum products and bulk and non bulk import 
items) and with major trading partners (namely, OECD, OPEC, Eastern Europe and 
Developing Countries) registered a decline during April-October 2009 over the 
corresponding period of previous year. 
 
Time Series data on Month-end Secondary Market Yield on G-Secs 
 
The June issue of the RBI Bulletin also carries, for the first time, time-series 
data on ëMonth-end Secondary Market Yield on Government of India Securitiesí 
(Table No. 27 under ëCurrent Statisticsí). The data is based on FIMMDA/ PDAI 
month-end valuation of Government of India Securities. The table provides 
comparative data on security-wise month-end yield of all outstanding Government of 
India Dated Securities. Besides month-end yield data, the table also provides year-
end data (as on March 31) for two latest years. Since all market participants 
extensively use the FIMMDA valuation, it is expected to be useful to the Bulletin 
readers to get the FIMMDA/ PDAI yield data in a time-series form.
