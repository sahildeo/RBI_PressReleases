RBI announces Auction of 35-day Cash Management Bills  
 
The Reserve Bank of India has today announced the auction of 35-day 
Government of India Cash Management Bills for a notified amount of Rs. 6,000 crore. 
The auction will be conducted on May 11, 2010 using "Multiple Price Auction" method. 
The Cash Management Bills will be repaid at par on June 16, 2010. The competitive 
bids for the auction should be submitted in electronic format on the Negotiated Dealing 
System (NDS) between 10.30 a.m. and 12.30 p.m on Tuesday, May 11, 2010. Results 
will be announced on the same day. Payments by successful bidders will be on 
Wednesday May 12, 2010. 
 
It may be recalled that the Government of India, in consultation with the Reserve 
Bank of India, had, in August 2009, decided to issue a new short term instrument to 
meet the temporary cash flow mismatches of the Government. The press release 
issued by the Reserve Bank and the Government at that time said the new instrument, 
known as Cash Management Bills, will be non-standard, discounted instruments issued 
for maturities less than 91 days. The Cash Management Bills will have the generic 
character of Treasury Bills and their sale will be subject to the terms and conditions 
specified in the General Notification No. F.2 (12)-W&M/97 dated March 31, 1998 issued 
by Government of India and as amended from time to time. 
 
Features of Cash Management Bills: 
ï The tenure, notified amount and date of issue of the proposed Cash 
Management Bills will depend upon the temporary cash requirement of the 
Government. However, the tenure of the proposed Bills will be less than 91 days. 
ï The proposed Bills will be issued at discount to the face value through auctions, 
as in the case of the Treasury Bills. 
ï The announcement of the auction of the proposed Bills will be made by the 
Reserve Bank of India through separate Press Release to be issued one day 
prior to the date of auction. 
ï The settlement of the auction will be on T+1 basis. 
ï The Non-Competitive Bidding Scheme for Treasury Bills will not be extended to 
the Cash Management Bills. 
ï The proposed Bills will be tradable and qualify for ready forward facility. 
Investment in the proposed Bills will be reckoned as an eligible investment in 
Government Securities by banks for SLR purpose under Section 24 of the 
Banking Regulation Act, 1949.
