RBI Announces Liquidity Easing Measures 
 
 The Monetary Policy Statement for 2010-11 had indicated that the Reserve 
Bank intends to actively manage liquidity to ensure that the growth in demand for 
credit by both the private and public sectors is satisfied in a non-disruptive way. 
Accordingly, the Reserve Bank has been closely monitoring the developments in 
the global and domestic financial markets. 
2. The latest assessment of liquidity conditions suggests that there could be 
temporary liquidity pressures in the market largely due to changes in government 
balances on account of advance tax payments and 3G auctions. In order to 
address the temporary liquidity pressures, the following measures are being taken:  
(i)  Scheduled commercial banks may avail of additional liquidity support under 
the LAF to the extent of up to 0.5 per cent of their net demand and time 
liabilities (NDTL). For any shortfall in maintenance of SLR arising out of 
availment of this facility, banks may seek waiver of penal interest purely as 
an ad hoc, temporary measure. This facility will be available till July 2, 
2010. 
 
(ii)  The second LAF (SLAF) will be conducted on a daily basis up to July 2, 
2010. The SLAF will be conducted between 4.00 p.m. and 4.30 p.m.  
3.    These measures are ad hoc in nature and the additional liquidity support 
under this scheme and the daily SLAF will be available with effect from May 28, 
2010 and up to July 2, 2010.
