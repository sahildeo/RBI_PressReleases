The President of India, Her Excellency Smt. Pratibha Devisingh Patil released a stamp 
commemorating the Reserve Bank of India’s Platinum Jubilee today at a function held in the New 
Delhi office of the Reserve Bank. The Reserve Bank of India started functioning on April 1, 1935, 
th
making April 1, 2009 to March 31, 2010 its 75 year.  
 
The stamp, depicting the iconic New Delhi building of the Reserve Bank of India and a 
representation of India’s currency and coins, was released in the august presence of Shri Pranab 
Mukherjee, Hon’ble Finance Minister, Shri Gurudas Kamat, Minister of State for Communication and 
Information Technology and Shri Namo Narain Meena, Minister of State for Banking and Insurance. 
Former Governors Dr. C Rangarajan, Dr. Bimal Jalan and Dr. Y V Reddy were also present.  
 
While releasing the commemorative stamp, the President noted that in the 75 years of 
existence the Reserve Bank has acted in a highly responsible manner and has contributed to 
providing support to the nation’s economy both during critical and relatively normal times. The 
President emphasised that the performance of the Reserve Bank, including during the recent 
crisis demonstrated that its experience of regulating monetary flows of the nation has lent to it 
“high stature and given it deep maturity and perspective to deal with a range of complex 
economic issues.”  
 
The President observed that one of the main objectives in India is financial inclusion.  “The 
priority of the banking system should be to strengthen itself significantly to support a modern, 
vibrant and inclusive economy,” she said. “The banking system in the country has grown 
considerably, but yet even today the challenge is to reach the unbanked areas, particularly in the 
rural.  I am confident that the Reserve Bank will provide appropriate policies and framework to 
achieve this objective,” she said.  “The Reserve Bank has been aligning the banking system to 
respond to the needs and priorities of our development agenda.  At this stage as part of their 
increased social responsibility, we need a greater involvement of the banking system in the 
ongoing national development programmes,” she added. She urged the Reserve Bank to guide 
the banking system appropriately. 
 
The President concluded by saying that the Reserve Bank has adapted well to the changing 
requirements and has been able to innovate and implement policies that have enabled the country to 
achieve high growth rates. 
 
 The Reserve Bank Governor Dr. D Subbarao noted in his remarks that while 75 years is a 
relatively short span for an institution, the journey since its establishment in 1935 has been eventful, 
shaping not only its intellectual evolution but also securing its permanent position in the economic 
policy space of the country. The Governor added that during this time, there have been momentous 
changes - a paradigm shift in economic ideology, new perspectives on economic development, growing aspirations of people, path-breaking financial innovations and game changing technological 
breakthroughs. “All these are changes which have influenced the Reserve Bank, and changes to 
which the Reserve Bank has had to respond in its own unique way,” he said. “The Reserve Bank is 
proud to have been part of every major economic event and policy in the country and its 
broad mandate underlines its enduring concern for the larger public good.”  
 
In his speech, Shri Gurudas Kamat, Hon’ble Minister of State for Information and 
Communication Technology stated that the postage stamp, apart from being a token of receipt of 
postage, was also a tool for celebrating and promoting the nation’s heritage, a paper ambassador, a 
grand image of the postal administration and a statement of the nation’s sovereignty like currency. In 
bringing out commemorative postage stamps, the Department of Posts was committed to nurturing 
the historical and cultural heritage of a nation.  “Today, it is with pride that we are going to issue a 
commemorative postage stamp celebrating 75 years of the Reserve Bank of India,” Shri Kamat said. 
 
The Hon’ble Finance Minster Shri Pranab Mukherjee congratulated the Reserve Bank and its 
staff on the occasion of the Reserve Bank’s Platinum Jubilee. Commending the Reserve Bank’s 
role in battling the recent financial crisis, the Finance Minister said that by responding to the 
evolving situation quickly, effectively and responsibly, the Reserve Bank had helped the 
country in mitigating the impact of the crisis.  The Finance Minister appreciated the sincere and 
dedicated service put in over all these years by the Reserve Bank staff. He also pointed out that the 
Reserve Bank was particularly fortunate to have distinguished personalities at its helm all these years 
that shaped, formed and steered the Reserve Bank’s culture and contributed significantly to financial 
policy making in India.  
           
Referring to the role of central banks in emerging economies like India, Shri Namo Narain 
Meena, Hon’ble Minister of State for Banking and Insurance said that while pursuing multiple 
objectives and managing complex trade-offs, a central bank like the Reserve Bank had to assume, 
over the years, the responsibility of looking after the interests of several agents, including depositors, 
intermediaries, government, business and external trade. The Reserve Bank was also actively 
involved in institution building in the Indian financial sector and developing financial markets in India. 
As a result, today what the Reserve Bank does, touched the lives of every Indian. While concluding, 
he hoped that the Reserve Bank would continue to contribute even more fruitfully to the growth and 
development of the nation.
