Reserve Bank Cancels the License of Vizianagaram Co-operative 
Bank Ltd. Vizianagaram, Andhra Pradesh 
 
In view of the fact that the operations of the Vizianagaram Co-operative Urban 
Bank Ltd. Vizianagaram, (Andhra Pradesh) were being carried out in a manner 
detrimental to the interest of its depositors and that of the public in general, its 
financial position was on the decline with no scope for revival in the foreseeable 
future and all efforts to ensure regulatory compliance  in consultation with the 
Government of Andhra Pradesh had failed and the depositors were being 
inconvenienced by continued uncertainty, the Reserve Bank of India delivered the 
order canceling its license to the bank after the close of business on June 10,  2010. 
The Registrar of Co-operative Societies, Andhra Pradesh State has also been 
requested to issue an order for winding up the bank and appoint a liquidator for the 
bank.  It may be highlighted that on liquidation, every depositor is entitled to 
repayment of his/her deposits up to a monetary ceiling of Rs. 1,00,000/- (Rupees 
one lakh only) from the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation 
(DICGC) under usual terms and conditions.  
 
The bank was granted a license by Reserve Bank on February 26, 1986 to 
commence banking business.  The statutory inspection conducted with reference to 
the financial position as on March 31, 2003 onwards, revealed that the financial 
position of the bank was deteriorating in important financial parameters viz. 
assessed net worth, CRAR, Gross / Net NPAs, etc. resulting in deposit erosion. A 
requisition was made to the Registrar of Co-operative Societies, Andhra Pradesh to 
supersede the Board of Directors of the bank. A Special Officer/Administrator was 
appointed on January 27, 2004 and PIC committee was appointed on February 21, 
2005 to manage the affairs of the bank. However, the bank could not show 
improvement despite sufficient time being allowed and as such Operational 
instructions had been issued to the bank on April 26, 2007 restricting it from allowing 
premature withdrawal of deposits and also from accepting fresh deposits.  
 
The statutory inspection of the bank under Section 35 of the Banking 
Regulation Act 1949 (AACS) with reference to its financial position as on March 31, 
2009 revealed that the bank was not having adequate assets to meet its liabilities as 
required under Section 22 (3) (a) of the Act. Further, the bank had not complied with 
the requirements of minimum capital and reserves in terms of the provisions of 
Section 11 (1) of the Act.  It was not in a position to pay its present and future 
depositors in full, as and when their claims accrue. The financial position of the bank 
left no scope for revival and in all likelihood, public interest would be adversely 
affected if the bank was allowed to carry on banking business.  2
 
The Reserve Bank of India issued a show cause notice to the bank on 
November 13, 2009, asking it to show cause as to why the license granted to it to 
conduct banking business should not be cancelled. The bankís reply to the show 
cause notice was not found satisfactory. The bank did not submit any concrete plan 
of action to turn around its financial position. In the absence of any viable action plan 
to comply with statutory requirements, Reserve Bank of India took the extreme 
measure of canceling the license of the bank in the interest of the bank's depositors. 
With the cancellation of its license and commencement of liquidation proceedings, 
the process of paying the depositors of Vizianagaram Co-operative Urban Bank Ltd., 
Vizianagaram, (Andhra Pradesh) will be set in motion subject to the terms and 
conditions of the Deposit Insurance Scheme.   
 
Consequent to the cancellation of its licence, Vizianagaram Co-operative 
Urban Bank Ltd., Vizianagaram, (Andhra Pradesh), is prohibited from carrying on 
ëbanking businessí as defined in Section 5(b) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 
(AACS) including acceptance and repayment of deposits.
