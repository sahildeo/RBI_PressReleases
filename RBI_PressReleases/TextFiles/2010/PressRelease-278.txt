RBI releases Approach Paper on Automated Data Flow from Banks 
 
The Reserve Bank of India, today released an approach paper on automated 
data flow (a straight through process) from the core banking solution (CBS) or other 
IT systems of commercial banks to the Reserve Bank. The Paper was prepared by a 
Core Group consisting of experts from banks, the Reserve Bank, the Institute for 
Development and Research in Banking Technology (IDRBT) and the Indian Banksí 
Association (IBA).  
 
The paper, among other things, discusses the methodology to be adopted by 
banks to classify themselves into a cluster based on its technology and process 
dimensions.   According to the approach paper, banks would be required, in the first 
phase, to ensure seamless flow of data from their transaction server to their 
management information system (MIS) server and automatically generate all returns 
from the MIS server, without any manual intervention. In the second phase, the 
Reserve Bank would introduce a system for the flow of data from the MIS server of 
banks in a straight through process. 
   
The timeline of the entire project will be determined in consultation with banks. 
Banks are being advised to conduct a self-assessment and furnish the estimated 
timelines for completing the first phase of the project. 
 
Background 
 
As the policy and decision-making processes are becoming more information 
intensive, it is imperative to ensure quality of data and their timely submission.  With 
a view to ensuring accuracy and integrity of data flow from the banking system to the 
Reserve Bank, a core group comprising experts from banks, the Reserve Bank, 
IDRBT and the IBA was constituted for preparing an approach paper on automated 
data flow (a straight-through-process) from the core banking solution (CBS) or other 
IT systems of commercial banks to the Reserve Bank.  The Annual Policy for 2010-
11 announced in April 2010 had mentioned this and had stated that the approach 
paper would be circulated among banks. 
  
The approach paper is available on the RBI website.
