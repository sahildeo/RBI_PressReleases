Reserve Bank of India Launches Business Outlook Survey 
The Reserve Bank of India had set up a Working Group on Surveys 
(Chairman: Shri Deepak Mohanty, Executive Director) that recommended the 
introduction of a series of surveys to provide quick and forward looking inputs for 
monetary policy.  
The Business Outlook Survey for Trading Sector is one such survey that is 
expected to asses the business expectation of the largest section of the services 
sector i.e. trading sector. The survey seeks to collect the assessment on current 
business situations and perceptions for the ensuing quarter from wholesale/retail 
trading units in India, through a set of structured questions covering different 
business parameters.  
The survey is being conducted on a quarterly basis and covers the metro 
cities of Mumbai, Chennai, Delhi and Kolkata. The second round of the survey is 
being launched for October-December 2010. M/s Datamation Consultants Private 
Limited, New Delhi has been selected as the agency for conducting the survey for 
this quarter on behalf of the Reserve Bank of India. The participating trading units 
will be approached by the agency in the next 3/4 weeks. As the response to the 
survey will provide useful forward looking inputs for monetary policy, the Bank would 
appreciate the support and valued response from senior management/financial 
personnel of the participating trading unit.
