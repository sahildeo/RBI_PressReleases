Reserve Bank Cancels the Licence of 
Vidarbha Urban Co-Operative Bank Ltd., Akola, (Maharashtra) 
 
In view of the fact that Vidarbha Urban Co-operative Bank Ltd., Akola, 
(Maharashtra) had ceased to be solvent, all efforts to revive it in close consultation 
with the Government of Maharashtra had failed and the depositors of the bank were 
being inconvenienced by continued uncertainty, the Reserve Bank of India delivered 
the order, canceling its licence to the bank on April 22, 2010 at 10.15 a.m. The 
Registrar of Co-operative Societies, Maharashtra has also been requested to issue 
an order for winding up of the bank and appoint a Liquidator for the bank. It may be 
highlighted that on liquidation every depositor is entitled to repayment of his deposits 
up to a monetary ceiling of Rs.1,00,000/- (Rupees One Lakh only) from the Deposit 
Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC).  
 
The bank was granted a licence by Reserve Bank on April 11, 1998 to 
commence banking business. The statutory inspection of the bank conducted by RBI 
with reference to its financial position as on March 31, 2006, revealed that the bankís 
financial position was adverse. Operational Instructions were issued to the bank on 
September 13, 2006. The statutory inspection of the bank conducted with reference 
to its financial position as on March 31, 2008 revealed that its financial position had 
worsened. Subsequent inspection of the bank conducted with reference to its 
financial position as on March 31, 2009 revealed that its financial position had 
deteriorated further. Keeping in view the deteriorating financial position, the bank 
was placed under directions under section 35-A of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 
(AACS) from the close of business as on October 12, 2009 placing restrictions on its 
activities. The Board of Directors of the bank was superseded vide order dated 
October 29, 2009 at the requisition of the Reserve Bank of India. A notice was 
issued to the bank as on November 17, 2009 requiring it to show cause as to why 
the licence granted to it under section 22 of the Act on April 11, 1998 to carry on 
banking business should not be cancelled and the bank be taken into liquidation. 
The reply dated January 22, 2010 received from the bank to the show cause notice 
was not satisfactory. The bank did not submit any viable action plan for its revival.  
 
The realizable value of bank's paid-up capital and reserves was negative and 
the chances of its revival were remote. In the absence of a viable action plan, the 
Reserve Bank of India took the extreme measure of canceling licence of the bank in 
the interest of the bank's depositors. With the cancellation of its licence and 
commencement of liquidation proceedings, the process of paying the depositors of 
Vidarbha Urban Co-Operative Bank Ltd., Akola, (Maharashtra), the amount insured 
as per the DICGC Act will be set in motion, subject to the terms and condition of 
DICGC. 
  2
Consequent to the cancellation of its licence, Vidarbha Urban Co-Operative 
Bank Ltd., Akola, (Maharashtra) is prohibited from carrying on 'banking business' as 
defined in Section 5(b) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (As Applicable to 
Cooperative Societies) including acceptance and repayment of deposits.
