Reserve Bank Cancels the Licence of The Cambay Hindu  
Merchants Co-operative Bank Ltd., Khambhat (Gujarat) 
 
In view of the fact that The Cambay Hindu Merchants Co-operative Bank Ltd., 
Khambhat (Gujarat), had ceased to be solvent, all efforts to revive it in close consultation 
with the Government of Gujarat had failed and the depositors were being inconvenienced by 
continued uncertainty, the Reserve Bank of India delivered the order cancelling its licence to 
the bank after the close of business on December 30, 2009. The Registrar of Co-operative 
Societies, Gujarat has also been requested to issue an order for winding up the bank and 
appoint a liquidator for the bank.  It may be highlighted that on liquidation, every depositor is 
entitled to repayment of his/her deposits up to a monetary ceiling of Rs. 1,00,000/- (Rupees 
One lakh only) from the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) 
under usual terms and conditions.  
The bank was granted a licence by Reserve Bank of India on August 27, 1986 to 
commence banking business.  A snap scrutiny of the bank conducted on July 09, 2009 
revealed that the bank was facing acute liquidity problem. 
The subsequent statutory inspection of the bank with respect to its position as on 
March 31, 2009 revealed that its financial position had deteriorated and was precarious. Due 
to precarious financial position and the liquidity crunch faced by the bank it was placed under 
directions with effect from September 07, 2009 vide Directive UBD. NSB No. D-
61/12.21.44/2009-10 dated September 02, 2009.  The Reserve Bank of India issued a show 
cause notice to the bank on September 10, 2009 asking it to show cause as to why the 
licence granted to it to conduct banking business should not be cancelled. The bankís reply 
to the show cause notice was examined.  The bank did not have a viable plan of action for 
its revival. In the absence of any viable proposal for turnaround and means to achieve the 
required regulatory prescriptions the possibility of revival of the bank was remote. Therefore, 
the Reserve Bank of India took the extreme measure of cancelling licence of the bank in the 
interest of the bank's depositors. With the cancellation of its licence and commencement of 
liquidation proceedings, the process of paying the depositors of the Cambay Hindu 
Merchants Co-operative Bank Ltd., Khambhat (Gujarat) will be set in motion subject to the 
terms and conditions of the Deposit Insurance Scheme.   
Consequent to the cancellation of its licence, The Cambay Hindu Merchants Co-
operative Bank Ltd., Khambhat (Gujarat) is prohibited from carrying on ëbanking businessí as 
defined in Section 5(b) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (AACS) including acceptance 
and repayment of deposits.

Manager, Urban Banks Department, Reserve Bank of India, Ahmedabad. His contact details
