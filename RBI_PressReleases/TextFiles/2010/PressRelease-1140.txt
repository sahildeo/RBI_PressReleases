RBI's Rajbhasha Shield Awards Ceremony 
 
 Dr. D. Subbarao, Governor, Reserve Bank of India while awarding the 
Rajbhasha Shields for the year 2008-2009, said that no banking business can progress 
without Hindi or Indian languages. Banking services can be provided in a better way if 
conducted in Hindi and Regional Languages. Hindi can play a greater role in reaching 
out to common man and improve banking business.  
 
 Dr. K.C. Chakrabarty, Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India while 
complimenting the prize winning banks and financial institutions said that we are taking 
banking to the doors of the common man and in this way the language whether it is 
regional or Hindi - can play an important role. Last year we have deeply felt this during 
the outreach programmes in Platinum Jubilee Year of Reserve Bank. He emphasised 
that to promote Hindi is not only a statutory but also a moral responsibility. To promote 
Hindi is essential as the banking backwardness is prevalent mostly in Hindi speaking 
regions. 
 
The annual Reserve Bank Rajbhasha Shield was instituted in 1980 to encourage 
public sector banks to use Hindi in their day-to-day work. The Reserve Bank also 
conducts a competition for the house journals of banks and financial institutions. The 
Reserve Bank started an Inter-Bank Hindi Essay Competition from 2002-03. 
 
Earlier, Shri V. S. Das, Executive Director, Reserve Bank of India welcomed the 
Chief Executives of banks and financial institutions. Shri Prabal Sen, Principal Chief 
General Manager, Department of Administration and Personnel Management, Reserve 
Bank of India, proposed a vote of thanks. Ms. Roopam Misra, General Manager, 
Rajbhasha Department, Reserve Bank of India conducted the programme.  
 
 The function was attended by chairmen and other senior executives of banks 
and financial institutions.
