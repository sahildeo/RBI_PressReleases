Reserve Bank Cancels the Licence of Rajeshwar Yuvak Vikas Sahakari  
Bank Ltd.,Satara, (Maharashtra) 
 In view of the fact that Rajeshwar Yuvak Vikas Sahakari Bank Ltd.,Satara. 
(Maharashtra) had ceased to be solvent, all efforts to revive it in close consultation with 
the Government of Maharashtra had failed and the depositors were being 
inconvenienced by continued uncertainty, the Reserve Bank of India delivered the order 
cancelling its licence to the bank after the close of business on  April 8, 2010 . The 
Registrar of Co-operative Societies, Maharashtra State has also been requested to issue 
an order for winding up the bank and appoint a liquidator for the bank.  It may be 
highlighted that on liquidation, every depositor is entitled to repayment of his/her 
deposits up to a monetary ceiling of Rs. 1,00,000/- (Rupees one lakh only) from the 
Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) under usual terms and 
conditions.  
The bank was granted a licence by Reserve Bank on August 12, 1997 to 
commence banking business.  The statutory inspection of the bank with reference to its 
position as on March 31,2009 had indicated that its financial position was impaired and it 
was issued directions under Section 35 A of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (As 
applicable to Co-operative Societies) from the close of business of November 16, 2009  
restricting its operations.  
The Reserve Bank of India issued a show cause notice to the bank on November 
30,2009 asking it to show cause as to why the licence granted to it to conduct banking 
business should not be cancelled. The reply to the show cause notice was examined.  
The bank did not have a viable plan of action for its revival. In the absence of any viable 
proposal to turn around and achieve the required regulatory prescriptions the possibility 
of revival of the bank was remote. Therefore, the Reserve Bank of India took the 
extreme measure of cancelling licence of the bank in the interest of the bank's 
depositors. With the cancellation of its licence and commencement of liquidation 
proceedings, the process of paying the depositors of Rajeshwar Yuvak Vikas Sahakari 
Bank Ltd.,Satara.(Maharashtra) will be set in motion subject to the terms and conditions 
of the Deposit Insurance Scheme.   
Consequent to the cancellation of its licence, Rajeshwar Yuvak Vikas Sahakari 
Bank Ltd.,Satara is prohibited from carrying on ëbanking businessí as defined in Section 
5(b) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (AACS) including acceptance and repayment 
of deposits.

Manager, Urban Banks Department, Mumbai Regional Office Reserve Bank of India,.
