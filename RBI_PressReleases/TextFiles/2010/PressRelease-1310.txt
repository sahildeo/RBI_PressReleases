RBI changes guidelines for Securitisation Companies and  
Reconstruction Companies  
 
 The Reserve Bank of India has today announced changes in the guidelines  
issued to securitisation companies and reconstruction companies. The guidelines 
were originally issued on April 23, 2003 and September 20, 2006. The changes have 
been announced to facilitate such companies in complying with the guidelines. 
According to the changed guidelines : 
 
ï Securitisation companies (SCs)/reconstruction companies (RCs) can acquire 
the assets either in their own books or directly in the books of the trusts set up 
by them. 
 
ï The period for realisation of assets acquired by SC/RCs can be extended 
from five years to eight years by their Board of Directors, subject to 
conditions.  
ï Additional avenues for deployment of surplus funds with National Bank for 
Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) and Small Industries 
Development Bank of India (SIDBI) are provided to securitisation companies 
and reconstruction companies. An upper limit of 10 per cent of the owned 
funds has been stipulated for the investment of SC/RCs in land and buildings 
for their own use. 
ï Any asset/security receipts which remain unresolved/not redeemed as at the 
end of five years or eight years would now be treated as loss asset. 
ï With a view to bringing  transparency and market discipline in the functioning 
of SC/RCs, additional disclosures related to assets realised during the year, 
value of financial assets unresolved as at the end of the year, value of 
security receipts pending for redemption, etc., have been prescribed. 
ï It is now mandatory for SC/RCs to invest in and continue to hold a minimum  
five  per cent stake of the outstanding amount of the security receipts issued 
by them  under each scheme and each class till the redemption of all the 
security receipts issued under a  particular scheme. 
Two circular containing these modifications have been placed on the Reserve 
Bank of India's  website (www.rbi.org.in).
