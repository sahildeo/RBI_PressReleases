Sources of Variation in Foreign Exchange Reserves in 
India during April-June 2010-11 
Earlier today, the Reserve Bank of India released the Balance of Payments 
(BoP) data for the first quarter (April-June) of 2010-11 on its website 
(www.rbi.org.in). On the basis of these data, sources of variation in foreign exchange 
reserves during April-June 2010-11 have been compiled. 
Sources of Variation in Foreign Exchange Reserves: April-June 2010-11 
During April-June 2010-11, there was an accretion to the foreign exchange 
reserves in BoP terms (i.e., excluding valuation effects). However, in nominal terms 
(i.e., including valuation effects), there was a decline in foreign exchange reserves 
during the quarter. The sources of variation in the foreign exchange reserves are set 
out in Table 1.
