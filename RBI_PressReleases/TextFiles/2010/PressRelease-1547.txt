Report of the Committee on Comprehensive  
Regulation for Credit Rating Agencies (CRAs) 
The Reserve Bank of India has today placed on its website, the report of the 
Committee on Comprehensive Regulation of Credit Rating Agencies (Chairman: Dr. 
K.P. Krishnan) for wider dissemination.  The Committee was constituted by the 
Ministry of Finance at the instance of the High Level Coordination Committee on 
Financial Markets (HLCCFM) to revisit the legal and policy framework for regulating 
the activities of Credit Rating Agencies (CRAs) in order to take a larger view of the 
entire policy with respect to banking, insurance and securities market.  The 
Committee submitted its report to the HLCCFM on December 21, 2009. An 
assessment of the long term performance of the Credit Rating Agencies in India, 
undertaken by the National Institute of Securities Markets (NISM) as part of the 
terms of reference of the Committee, is also placed on the website of the RBI. The 
report and the assessment are also available on the website of the Ministry of 
Finance, http://finmin.nic.in.
The Committee has observed that although, prima facie there is no immediate 
concern about the operations and activities of CRAs in India even in the context of 
the recent financial crisis, there is a need to strengthen the existing regulations by 
learning the appropriate lessons from the current crisis.  The Committee has taken 
note of international action in this regard and, inter alia, has recommended that there 
is a need for enhanced disclosure, continuation of the issuer-pays model, 
strengthened process and compliance audit, reporting of ownership changes, 
disclosure of default and transition statistics and strengthening of the regulation of 
the CRAs in tune with these suggestions.
