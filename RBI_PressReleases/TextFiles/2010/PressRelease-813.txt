RBI places the revised draft guidelines on Over the Counter (OTC) Foreign 
Exchange Derivatives and Overseas Hedging of Commodity Price Risk and 
Freight Risk for comments 
 
The Reserve Bank of India has, today, placed on its website the revised draft 
guidelines on OTC Foreign Exchange Derivatives and Hedging Commodity Price 
Risk and Freight Risk overseas (Annex I) for public comments.  
 
In the light of developments in the domestic and international financial 
markets, the extant guidelines on OTC foreign exchange derivatives were reviewed 
and the draft guidelines were placed on the Reserve Bankís website on November 
12, 2009 for feedback from the market participants. The draft guidelines, interalia, 
proposed to withdraw the facility of zero cost /cost reduction structures, permit  
importers and exporters having foreign currency exposures in trade transactions to 
write covered call and put options both in foreign currency-rupee and cross currency 
and also receive premia, etc. Some of the stake holders, particularly the corporates 
having global business, have represented to the Reserve Bank that prohibiting zero 
cost structures would seriously impede their forex risk management operations and 
global competitiveness. Further, if such structures were banned, some corporates 
may not hedge their currency exposures due to cost consideration and this may lead 
to aggregation of unhedged position, which is riskier than hedging within a range. 
Hence, they represented that cost reduction structures may be permitted, with 
suitable safeguards, such as higher net worth, compliance with the Accounting 
Standards (AS) 30/32, suitable risk management policy, etc. 
 
 The feedback received from the banks, corporates and other stake holders 
were examined and discussed in the meeting of the Technical Advisory Committee 
on Money, Foreign Exchange and Government Securities Markets and FIMMDA and 
FEDAI. Considering the suggestions made by the market participants, it is proposed, 
among others, to allow the use of cost reduction structures, subject to the 
safeguards including suitability and appropriateness of the products.    
 
 Comments on the draft guidelines may be forwarded to the Chief General 
Manager-in-Charge, Foreign Exchange Department, Forex Markets Division, 
th
Reserve Bank of India, Amar Building, 5 floor, P.M. Road, Fort, Mumbai - 400001
