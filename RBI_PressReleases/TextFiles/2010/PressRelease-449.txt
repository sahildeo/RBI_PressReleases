RBI sets up Committee on Licensing of Urban Co-operative Banks 
 
The Reserve Bank of India has constituted an Expert Committee under the 
Chairmanship of Shri Y.H. Malegam for studying the advisability of granting new urban co-
operative banking licences under Section 22 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 [As 
Applicable to Co-operative Societies (AACS)].  
 
The terms of reference of the Committee are as under: 
i) To review the role and performance of UCBs over the last decade and especially 
since the adoption of VISION document in 2004, 
ii) To review the need for organization of new UCBs in the context of the existing 
legal framework for UCBs, the thrust on financial inclusion in the economic policy 
and proposed entry of new commercial banks into the banking space, 
iii) To review the extant regulatory policy on setting up of new UCBs and lay down 
entry point norms for new UCBs, 
iv) To examine whether licensing could be restricted only to financially sound and 
well managed cooperative credit societies through conversion route, 
v) To make recommendations relating to the legal and regulatory structure to 
facilitate the growth of sound UCBs especially in the matter of raising capital 
consistent with cooperative principles. 
vi) To examine other issues incidental to licensing of UCBs and make appropriate 
recommendations.
