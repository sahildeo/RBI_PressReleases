RBI sets up Working Group to address  
Implementation Issues in IFRS 
 
 The Reserve Bank of India has constituted up a Working Group under the 
Chairmanship of Shri P R Ravi Mohan, Chief General Manager, Department of 
Banking Operations & Development (DBOD), Reserve Bank of India, to address 
the implementation issues and facilitate formulation of operational guidelines in the 
context of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) convergence for the 
Indian banking system.  The members of the Group include representatives from 
the Indian Banks' Association (IBA), Institute of Chartered Accountants of India 
(ICAI) and various regulatory and market related departments of the Reserve Bank 
of India. Besides, professionals with core competence, expertise and experience in 
IFRS implementation have been drafted in the Group as special invitees.  
 
 Six sub-groups have been formed to deal with the following issues:  
 
1. Classification and measurement of financial assets 
2. Classification and measurement of financial liabilities and hedge accounting. 
This group would also look into the balance sheet issues of corporates and 
their implications. 
3. Amortised cost and impairment      
4. Fair value measurement 
5. Presentation, disclosures and balance sheet formats 
6. Derecognition, consolidation and residuary issues. 
 
As the Working Group goes ahead with the task assigned to it, it would 
welcome the views from interested stakeholders. Views could be emailed. 
 
 In the context of convergence of Indian accounting standards with IFRSs, a 
separate road map for the banking industry and Non-Banking Finance Companies 
(NBFCs) has been prepared in March 2010. As per the road map, all scheduled 
commercial banks will convert their opening balance sheet as at April 1, 2013 in 
compliance with the IFRS converged Indian Accounting Standards. A gradualistic 
approach is proposed to be adopted for NBFCs and urban cooperative banks 
(UCBs).    2
 It was announced in the Annual Policy Statement for the year 2010-11 that 
in order to facilitate smooth migration to IFRSs, it is proposed to undertake a study 
of the implications of the IFRSs convergence process and to issue operational 
guidelines as appropriate.
