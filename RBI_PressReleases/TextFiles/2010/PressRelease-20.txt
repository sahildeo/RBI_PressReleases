India’s Financial Sector remained Stress-free; 
But Risks arising from Macro-Economic Soft Spots and Global Growth 
Asymmetries remain: RBI’s Second Financial Stability Report 
            The Reserve Bank of India presented its assessment of the health of India’s 
financial sector in the second Financial Stability Report (FSR), released here today. 
The report reflects the Reserve Bank’s continuing endeavour to communicate its 
assessment of the incipient risks to financial sector stability. The first FSR was 
released in March 2010. 
The second FSR holistically assesses, from a systemic risk perspective, 
disparate elements of the financial sector eco-structure – the macroeconomic 
setting, policies, markets, institutions. The movements of various vulnerabilities 
between March and December 2010 and assessment of the resilience of the 
financial system have been presented in this Report. It also reflects the considerable 
efforts made within the Reserve Bank to upgrade the methods and techniques for 
assessing the health of the financial system in identifying and analysing potential 
risks to systemic stability.  
According to the Report, growth has rebounded strongly in the Indian 
economy while financial conditions remained stable since the publication of the first 
Financial Stability Report (FSR) in March 2010. The financial sector in India 
remained stress-free notwithstanding intermittent volatility, especially in equity and 
foreign exchange markets. This is also displayed by the Financial Stress Indicator for 
India, which was introduced in the first FSR. Financial institutions remained healthy, 
credit offtake has picked up, as has profitability, especially in the first half of 2010-11. 
The Banking Stability Index points to a healthy improvement in the stability of the 
banking sector over the past few years. This is corroborated by the results of a range 
of stress tests undertaken by the Reserve Bank.  
The Report points at some discernible soft spots. The current account deficit 
is widening while capital flows continue to be dominated by volatile components. 
External sector ratios have deteriorated, fiscal conditions are still under pressure and 
inflationary pressures persist. Liquidity conditions tightened beyond the Reserve 
Bank’s comfort level and some policy measures have recently been taken to 
alleviate the stress. Some issues in the financial market microstructure will need to 
be addressed. Asset quality of banks and their asset-liability management position 
continue to warrant monitoring. Regulatory gaps in the non-banking financial sector 
will need to be plugged. A robust macro prudential framework for identification of 
systemic risks will need to be set up. Convergence with the emergent international 
reforms agenda presents challenges and will require careful calibration.   
Referring to some tail risks to financial stability, the Report states that they are 
largely exogenous given the increasing correlation between global growth and that in 
Emerging Market Economies(EMEs), including India. The finance channel has 
??????????2 
 
assumed greater importance increasing the pace and degree of contagion from 
disturbances abroad, it states. Similarly, business cycle synchronisation of the Indian 
economy with most of the advanced economies and other EMEs has increased. With 
both financial and real sector still under stress in advanced economies, India will 
have to guard against vulnerabilities arising from risks to global growth and financial 
stability.  
That the Reserve Bank will soon release the Financial Stability Report was 
announced in the Second Quarter Review of the Monetary Policy 2010-11 in 
November, 2010. 
Highlights 
Global Environment 
• Global recovery continues to be uneven and uncertain while downside risks 
remain significant;  
 
• A prolonged low interest rate regime in advanced countries, the two-track 
global recovery and divergent course of monetary policy actions have created 
push and pull factors for large capital inflows into EMEs;  
 
• Global imbalances continue to persist and the progress towards rebalancing 
remains too slow; 
 
• Significant amounts of sovereign debt, especially in European countries, are 
maturing in the next few years and any renewed turbulence could severely 
impair the fragile global recovery. 
Domestic Outlook and Assessment 
• In India, growth has rebounded strongly but inflationary pressures persist, 
driven both by domestic demand and increasing global commodity prices. 
Inflation, particularly food inflation, in India continues to rule at elevated levels 
reflecting in part the structural demand-supply mismatches resulting from, 
inter alia, rising incomes and changing consumption patterns;  
 
• External sector ratios for India have deteriorated, fiscal conditions are still 
under pressure and inflationary pressures remain elevated; 
 
• A potentially worrying feature of capital flows to India has been the dominance 
of portfolio flows which are prone to sudden stops and reversals. However, at 
present, stressed liquidity conditions warrant caution and a watchful 
management in the coming months; 
 
• Household and corporate balance sheets are healthy.  
 Financial Markets 
• Efficacy of the LAF corridor needs to be improved; 
 
• Need for a well-developed term structure in money markets; 
 
• Deeper and more liquid bond markets desirable; 
• Increased integration of domestic financial markets has led to volatilities in 
forex markets rising in alignment with international levels; 
• Growing offshore Rupee markets constrains the policy actions for maintaining 
orderly conditions in the domestic markets; 
 
• Concentration of market activities in a few participants makes the market 
prone to bouts of illiquidity. 3 
 
Financial Institutions  
• Financial sector remained resilient but vigilance on asset quality and liquidity 
is needed;  
• Provision coverage ratio met in aggregate, some laggards; 
 
• Infrastructure loans could heighten ALM risks though there are mitigants; 
 
• Off balance sheet (OBS) exposures of foreign banks warrants monitoring;  
• A robust co-operative banking sector is critical for financial inclusion.  
Regulatory Environment 
• The proposed capital rules pose some challenges  but the banking system is 
not likely to be unduly stretched; 
 
• Leverage and liquidity norms not binding constraints but pose some 
challenges; 
 
• Implementing international norms calibrated to local conditions will require 
concerted efforts; 
 
• The supervisory structure for financial conglomerates (FC) will have to draw 
on international policy developments;  
 
• NBFCs vis-a-vis banks – a few avenues for regulatory arbitrage remain; 
 
• Entity regulation could leave regulatory gaps which need to be addressed; 
 
• Microfinance institutions (MFIs) – recent concerns warrant closer examination; 
 
• Network connectivity important for ascertaining systemic vulnerabilities; 
 
• Strengthening the institutional mechanism for financial stability.  
Financial Infrastructure  
• Financial Market Infrastructure remained robust; 
• Systemic risk bearing capacity of Central Counter-Parties has become critical; 
 
• Deposit insurance system in India robust but some critical issues remain. 
 
Stress Testing 
• Stress testing on the credit, market and liquidity risks indicates a reasonable 
degree of resilience of the banking sector in India. The banking sector also 
displays resilience in response to stressed domestic macroeconomic 
variables; 
• The impact of strong headwinds arising from any sharp deterioration in the 
global economic situation needs to be monitored; 
• Some deterioration in the capital position of banks is evidenced only in case 
of a very sharp increase from the current NPA levels;  
• Rising Interest rates and liquidity constraints under stringent stress scenarios 
faced by some banks warrant monitoring.
