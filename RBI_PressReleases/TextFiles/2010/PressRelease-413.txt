RBI divests stake in NABARD 
 
        The Reserve Bank of India divested its stake amounting to Rs 1430 crore 
(Rupees one thousand four hundred and thirty crore) in National Bank for 
Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) on October 13, 2010. With this, 
the Reserve Bank's holding in NABARD has come down to one per cent of 
shareholding in NABARD. The Government of India now holds 99 per cent of the 
stake. 
 
       The Reserve Bank held 72.5 per cent of equity in NABARD amounting to   
Rs 1450 crore. The remaining shareholding of Rs 550 crore was with the 
Government of India. The Union Cabinet in May 2008 approved the Reserve 
Bank's proposal to transfer its share holding in NABARD to the Government of 
India. 
 
      Accordingly, the Government of India issued a notification on September 16, 
2010 prescribing the proportion of subscription/ownership of Government of India 
and Reserve Bank in NABARD as 99 per cent and 1 per cent respectively.  
 
     The transfer of 71.5 per cent shareholding of the Reserve Bank amounting to 
Rs 1430 crore (Rupees one thousand four hundred and thirty crore) in NABARD 
has been effected on October 13, 2010. Now the Reserve Bank holds one per 
cent of shareholding in NABARD and the Government of India 99 per cent.
