RBI issues Draft Guidelines regarding proposed  
Regulatory Framework for Core Investment Companies (CICs) 
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) today posted on its website the proposed 
Guidelines for regulatory framework for Core Investment Companies (CICs). The 
Reserve Bank evolved the draft guidelines as it had been receiving requests from 
companies and further in view of the systemic implications of access to public funds by 
CICs.  
To adopt a consultative approach, the guidelines have been placed on the 
Reserve Bank's website (www.rbi.org.in) for study by a wider audience. 
Comments/suggestions may please be sent by email at the earliest but within 15 days 
of hosting of the guidelines, for consideration of the Reserve Bank.
