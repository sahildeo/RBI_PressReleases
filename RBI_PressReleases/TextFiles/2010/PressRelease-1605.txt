Reserve Bank Cancels the Licence of the Chadchan Shree Sangameshwar 
Urban Co-operative Bank Ltd., Chadchan, Karnataka 
In view of the fact that the Chadchan Shree Sangameshwar Urban Co-operative Bank 
Ltd., Chadchan (Karnataka) had ceased to be solvent, all efforts to revive it in close consultation 
with the Government of Karnataka had failed and the depositors of the bank were being 
inconvenienced by continued uncertainty, the Reserve Bank of India delivered the order 
canceling its licence to the bank after the close of business on February 13, 2010. The Registrar 
of Co-operative Societies, Karnataka has also been requested to issue an order for winding up of 
the bank and appoint a Liquidator for the bank. It may be highlighted that on liquidation every 
depositor is entitled to repayment of his deposits up to a monetary ceiling of Rs.1,00,000/- from 
the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC).  
The bank was granted licence by Reserve Bank of India on September 04, 1986 to 
commence banking business. The statutory inspection conducted by Reserve Bank with 
reference to its financial position as on March 31, 2007 had revealed several disquieting features 
in the functioning of the bank. Accordingly, it was placed under operational instructions inter-alia 
permitting renewal of only standard loans and prohibiting sanction of fresh loans, extension of 
area of operations, declaration of dividend, etc. The next inspection conducted with respect to 
position as on March 31, 2008 had revealed that the bank's financial position had further 
deteriorated and the restrictions imposed were continued. The latest inspection conducted with 
reference to position as on March 31, 2009 revealed drastic deterioration of the financial position. 
In view of the deficiencies observed in the functioning of the bank, in public interest and in the 
interest of the depositors to prevent preferential payment and to preserve the assets of the bank, 
the bank was placed under directions under Section 35A of the Act vide directive dated August 
08, 2009 prohibiting it from sanctioning/renewing of loans and advances, making investments, 
borrowings and acceptance of fresh deposits. A cap of Rs.1000/- per depositor was placed on 
withdrawal of deposits. Subsequently, a show cause notice (SCN) for cancellation of licence was 
issued on August 25, 2009. The reply to the SCN did not furnish any viable plan for revival of the 
bank.  
After taking into account the foregoing and after examining all options for its revival, the 
Reserve Bank of India took the extreme measure of canceling the licence of the bank in the 
interest of the bank's depositors. With the cancellation of its licence and commencement of 
liquidation proceedings, the process of paying the depositors of the Chadchan Shree 
Sangameshwar Urban Co-operative Bank Ltd., Chadchan (Karnataka), the amount insured as 
per the DICGC Act will be set in motion. 
Consequent on cancellation of its licence, the Chadchan Shree Sangameshwar Urban 
Co-operative Bank Ltd., Chadchan (Karnataka) is prohibited from carrying on 'banking business' 
as defined in Section 5(b) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949(AACS) including acceptance and 
repayment of deposits.

General Manager, Urban Banks Department, Reserve Bank of India, Bangalore. His contact
